<u>{{gateway_product_name}} has by default '''no''' transparent proxying feature.</u>

The same in other words: {{gateway_product_name}} by default transparently proxies traffic originating from {{workstation_product_name}}, but does not transparently proxy traffic that is generated by {{gateway_product_name}}.

Instructions below document how <u>you could enable it</u>. There are no known use cases besides [[Dev/Leak Tests|leak testing]].
