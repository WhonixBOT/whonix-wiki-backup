= Cold boot attack =
Cold boot attack is a side channel attack which an attacker has physical access to a computer, which then ca n steal the memory from RAM before it disappears.

This attack relies on RAM from removing his content, which typically stays from seconds to minutes.
Usually this behavior (RAM cleaning his content) also depends on the user operation of handling sensitive things, such as forcefully shutting down a computer (with the power button) or clearing encryption keys from RAM.

This kind of attack is typically used for data recovery, investigations and more.

There is ways to defend from this type of attack, such as on [https://tails.boum.org Tails] which when the operating system is shut down, it writes random data to the RAM.

Defending Cold Boot Attacks makes most sense for users of [[Full Disk Encryption]] and/or [[Host Live Mode]].

To make memory forensics harder, make sure you shutdown your computer normally <ref>
so the Linux kernel's memory erasing features (<code>page_poison</code>, <code>slub_debug</code> or <code>init_on_free</code>) and/or your firmware reset attack mitigation can kick in
</ref> and then remove the machine from any power source by pulling the power plug. In the case of notebooks, the battery should be removed after powering off. And the computer should be turned when exposed to higher-risk situations like traveling. <ref>
And/or the memory should be wiped upon shutdown. This is a theoretical mechanism at present because it is [[undocumented]].

Use DDR3 RAM since it might be resistant to this attack. <ref>
Quote [https://cyberside.planet.ee/docs/fares_coldboot.pdf On the Practicability of Cold Boot Attacks]:

<blockquote>
we could not reproduce cold boot attacks against modern DDR3 chips.
