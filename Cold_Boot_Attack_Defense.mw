To make memory forensics harder, make sure you shutdown your computer normally <ref>
so the Linux kernel's memory erasing features (<code>page_poison</code>, <code>slub_debug</code> or <code>init_on_free</code>) and/or your firmware reset attack mitigation can kick in
</ref> and then remove the machine from any power source by pulling the power plug. In the case of notebooks, the battery should be removed. <ref>
And/or the memory should be wiped upon shutdown. This is a theoretical mechanism at present because it is [[undocumented]].
