Goals

* Whonix port to Hardened Gentoo
* grsecurity policy
* possibly in cooperation with [https://github.com/martincmelik/securix securix]
* [[Download|downloadable]] images not required
* creating a roadmap what is required for a Whonix Hardened Gentoo Port
* creation from source
* use of [https://github.com/Whonix/Gentoo-Port/issues/5 binary Gentoo packages] during build allowed (but probably not applicable due to missing hardening flags?)
* build target goals:
** amd64 builds
** physical isolation
** virtualization (ideally kvm, depending on grsec)
