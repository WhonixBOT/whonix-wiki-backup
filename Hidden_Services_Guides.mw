= OnionCat =
See [[OnionCat]].

= OpenBazaar =
You must configure Onioncat in Whonix for OpenBazaar to work. See instructions here <ref>https://www.whonix.org/wiki/OnionCat</ref>.

OpenBazaar uses DHT to find peers. DHT is a UDP protocol not natively supported by Tor. The way the community are using OpenBazaar with Tor  is by hosting seed nodes as Hidden Services and using Onioncat to connect with peers inside the Tor network. You must configure Onioncat in Whonix for OpenBazaar to work <ref>https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenBazaar/comments/2iusp4/openbazaar_tor_demo/</ref>. Onioncat supports UDP and other protocols too (within the Tor network).

= Sparkleshare =
For a private and anonymous DropBox alternative using TOR and Sparkleshare, see <ref>https://guardianproject.info/2013/11/12/your-own-private-dropbox-with-free-software/</ref>. To ensure that only you and the intended parties can access the service you need to set up Hidden Service Authentication, see instructions here <ref>https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Hidden_Services#Hidden_Service_Authentication</ref>
