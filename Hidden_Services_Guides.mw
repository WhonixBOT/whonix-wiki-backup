= GlobaLeaks =
Project main site: https://globaleaks.org/

Guide: https://github.com/globaleaks/GlobaLeaks/wiki/Installation-guide

This is a guide to help you set up your own secure and anonymous whistle blowing platform. Note that this is a standalone node and not part of a network, although you can optionally list yourself in the Global Leaks directory. <ref>http://leakdirectory.org/</ref>

= OnionCat =
See [[OnionCat]].

= OpenBazaar =
OpenBazaar supports both TCP and UDP. The latter was added to aid those using it on the clearnet that had difficulties connecting from behind their routers. <ref>https://github.com/OpenBazaar/OpenBazaar/issues/795</ref> When using Tor you don't have to worry about that.

A community demo for OpenBazaar  was done with Tor by hosting seed nodes as Hidden Services <ref>https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenBazaar/comments/2iusp4/openbazaar_tor_demo/</ref>

= Bittorrent Tracker and Client Setup + Onioncat =
This guide is for setting up an alternative and entirely anonymous p2p file sharing set up. Note that it hasn't been tested by Whonix devs yet.

OnionCat Tracker Server Setup : Introduction 

A BitTorrent tracker is a server that assists in the communication between peers using the BitTorrent protocol. OpenTracker is a free BitTorrent peer tracker software that is designed to be fast and to have a low consumption of system resources.

OpenTracker is currently only available from CVS, and as of 2010-12-11, a tarball (*.tar.gz) will be rolled-out soon.
Instructions 

Install CVS and GCC for your Linux operating system prior to installation. In Debian or Ubuntu, this can be done in terminal:

sudo apt-get install cvs build-essential

    Open a terminal (Alt+F2, type 'xterm'), and type

    cvs -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.fefe.de:/cvs -z9 co libowfat

    cd libowfat

    make

    cd ..

    cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@cvs.erdgeist.org:/home/cvsroot co opentracker

    cd opentracker

    echo "FEATURES+=-DWANT_V6" >> Makefile

    make

    Edit the OpenTracker configuration file, opentracker.conf, such as the sample below. The default settings allow OpenTracker to listen on all interfaces (0.0.0.0:6969/tcp/udp).
    OpenTracker config file

    listen.tcp_udp [fd87:d87e:eb43:5cf4:757c:2be9:5879:d9f7]:6969
    Optional: If you have a webserver running, you can forward GET or HTTP requests
    to your OnionCat IPv6 website; otherwise, comment out.

    tracker.redirect_url http://[fd87:d87e:eb43:5cf4:757c:2be9:5879:d9f7]/

    Run OpenTracker

    ./opentracker.debug -f opentracker.conf

***

1) Install OnionCat from Debian repository:
Code:

sudo apt-get install onioncat.


2) To setup OnionCat please see [[OnionCat]].


3) Install Bittornado
Code:

sudo apt-get install bittornado-gui bittornado


Enable IPv6 support and restart bittornado to enable changes

4) Get torrent file: http://[fd87:d87e:eb43:f20d:6d4f:239:ab70:1793]/censored.torrent

OK, you are ready to download over an end-to-end encrypted anonymous IPv6 tunnel.

= SecureDrop =
SecureDrop is another widely used whistle-blowing platform installed at many news organizations. To set it up please refer to the official guide at <ref>https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/blob/develop/docs/install.md</ref>. To use SecureDrop as a source check <ref>https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/blob/develop/docs/source_user_manual.md</ref> and for using SecureDrop as a journalist refer to <ref>https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/blob/develop/docs/journalist_user_manual.md</ref>. For general information and project code go to their main Github page <ref>https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop</ref>.

If you are a news or whistle-blowing site operator you may be interested in having your Hidden Service address listed in the Freedom of The Press Foundation's list <ref>https://freedom.press/securedrop/directory</ref>.

= Sparkleshare =
For a private and anonymous DropBox alternative using TOR and Sparkleshare, see <ref>https://guardianproject.info/2013/11/12/your-own-private-dropbox-with-free-software/</ref>. To ensure that only you and the intended parties can access the service you need to set up Hidden Service Authentication, see instructions here <ref>https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Hidden_Services#Hidden_Service_Authentication</ref>

= Stormy =
Stormy is a simple hidden service blog setup script. The developer hopes to have it packaged for Debian at some point. You can see it on Github here <ref>https://github.com/glamrock/Stormy</ref>
