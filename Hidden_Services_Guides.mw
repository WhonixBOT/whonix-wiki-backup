= GlobaLeaks =
Project main site: https://globaleaks.org/

Guide: https://github.com/globaleaks/GlobaLeaks/wiki/Installation-guide

This is a guide to help you set up your own secure and anonymous whistle blowing platform. Note that this is a standalone node and not part of a network, although you can optionally list yourself in the Global Leaks directory. <ref>http://leakdirectory.org/</ref>

= OnionCat =
See [[OnionCat]].

= OpenBazaar =
OpenBazaar supports both TCP and UDP. The latter was added to aid those using it on the clearnet that had difficulties connecting from behind their routers. <ref>https://github.com/OpenBazaar/OpenBazaar/issues/795</ref> When using Tor you don't have to worry about that.

A community demo for OpenBazaar  was done with Tor by hosting seed nodes as Hidden Services <ref>https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenBazaar/comments/2iusp4/openbazaar_tor_demo/</ref>

= SecureDrop =
SecureDrop is another widely used whistle-blowing platform installed at many news organizations. To set it up please refer to the official guide at <ref>https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/blob/develop/docs/install.md</ref>. To use SecureDrop as a source check <ref>https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/blob/develop/docs/source_user_manual.md</ref> and for using SecureDrop as a journalist refer to <ref>https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/blob/develop/docs/journalist_user_manual.md</ref>. For general information and project code go to their main Github page <ref>https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop</ref>.

If you are a news or whistle-blowing site operator you may be interested in having your Hidden Service address listed in the Freedom of The Press Foundation's list <ref>https://freedom.press/securedrop/directory</ref>.

= Sparkleshare =
For a private and anonymous DropBox alternative using TOR and Sparkleshare, see <ref>https://guardianproject.info/2013/11/12/your-own-private-dropbox-with-free-software/</ref>. To ensure that only you and the intended parties can access the service you need to set up Hidden Service Authentication, see instructions here <ref>https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Hidden_Services#Hidden_Service_Authentication</ref>

= Stormy =
Stormy is a simple hidden service blog setup script. The developer hopes to have it packaged for Debian at some point. You can see it on Github here <ref>https://github.com/glamrock/Stormy</ref>
