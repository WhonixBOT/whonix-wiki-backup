[https://github.com/globaleaks/GlobaLeaks/wiki/Installation-guide Guide]

This is a guide to help you set up your own secure and anonymous whistle blowing platform. Note that this is a standalone node and not part of a network, although you can optionally list yourself in the [http://leakdirectory.org/ Leaks Directory].

= OnionCat =
See [[OnionCat]].

= OpenBazaar =
OpenBazaar supports both TCP and UDP. The latter was added to aid those using it on the clearnet that had difficulties connecting from behind their routers. <ref>https://github.com/OpenBazaar/OpenBazaar/issues/795</ref> When using Tor you don't have to worry about that.

A [https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenBazaar/comments/2iusp4/openbazaar_tor_demo/ community demo] for OpenBazaar  was done with Tor by hosting seed nodes as Hidden Services.

= SecureDrop =
SecureDrop is another widely used whistle-blowing platform installed at many news organizations. To set it up please refer to the [https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/blob/develop/docs/install.md official guide]. To use SecureDrop as a source, refer to this [https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/blob/develop/docs/source_user_manual.md documentation] and for using SecureDrop as a journalist go [https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/blob/develop/docs/journalist_user_manual.md here]. For general information and project code go to their main [https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop Github page].

If you are a news or whistle-blowing site operator you may be interested in having your Hidden Service address listed at the [https://freedom.press/securedrop/directory Freedom of The Press Foundation].

= Sparkleshare =
For a private and anonymous DropBox alternative you can run [https://guardianproject.info/2013/11/12/your-own-private-dropbox-with-free-software/ Sparkleshare as a Hidden Service]. To ensure that only you and the intended parties can access the service you need to set up Hidden Service Authentication, see [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Hidden_Services#Hidden_Service_Authentication instructions].

= Stormy =
Stormy is a simple hidden service blog setup script. The developer hopes to have it packaged for Debian at some point. You can see it on [https://github.com/glamrock/Stormy Github].

=Torrenting over OnionCat=

This section will cover torrenting with anonymous peers inside the Tor network.

1. Set up [[OnionCat]] on Whonix Gateway. All parties involved will need to configure a Hidden Service with OnionCat because torrenting is bidirectional.

2. You will need to configure [https://www.whonix.org/w/index.php?title=OnionCat&stable=0&shownotice=1&fromsection=Tunneling_IPv4#Tunneling_IPv4 IPv4 over IPv6 tunneling] for OnionCat because the qBittorrent version in Debian Stable does not have IPv6 support.

3. Next install qBittorrent: <pre>sudo apt-get install qbittorrent</pre>
N.B. qBittorrent is the only popular libre software client to have a built-in tracker. Other trackers are in the form of separate packages that need be built from source (because they are not included in Debian) and could only be configured through the command line.

4. Start the torrent client and go to <pre>Options > Advanced</pre> and check  <pre>Enable embedded tracker</pre> and restart the program.<ref>https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/wiki/How-to-use-qBittorrent-as-a-tracker</ref>


5. Create your torrent: <pre>Tools > Torrent creator</pre> Add the file/folder you want to share. For Tracker Urls append the Workstation's OnionCat IPv4 address, for example 192.168.100.1, followed by the port number (default 9000) to the url: <pre>http://192.168.100.1:9000/announce</pre>
Check <pre>Start seeding after creation</pre> then create and save the torrent file.


6. Share the torrent file or alternatively the magnet link which you can get from right clicking the seeded torrent from the main panel.


In summary to share files you will need two things:
* Hidden Service addresses exchanged in order to derive the OnionCat IPv6 addresses and setup IPv4 tunneling. 
* magnet links or .torrent files.


For a private sharing environment you will need to configure Tor to use the HiddenServiceAuthorizeClient option. More on that [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Hidden_Services#Hidden_Service_Authentication here].
