=Introduction=
Whonix handles the anonymity aspect safely and transparently allowing you to concentrate on running and managing your service.

Here are guides for some interesting usecases.

To make your service better known you can list it on [https://ahmia.fi ahmia.fi] - a public directory of Onion sites that works closely with the Tor Project.

== GlobaLeaks ==
[https://globaleaks.org/ Project main site]

{{Third Party Repository}}

[https://github.com/globaleaks/GlobaLeaks/wiki/Installation-guide Install Guide from GlobaLeaks third party repository]

This is a guide to help you set up your own secure and anonymous whistle blowing platform. Note that this is a standalone node and not part of a network, although you can optionally list yourself in the [http://leakdirectory.org/ Leaks Directory].

== OnionCat ==
See [[OnionCat]].

== OpenBazaar ==
OpenBazaar supports both TCP and UDP. The latter was added to aid those using it on the clearnet that had difficulties connecting from behind their routers. <ref>https://github.com/OpenBazaar/OpenBazaar/issues/795</ref> When using Tor you don't have to worry about that.

A [https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenBazaar/comments/2iusp4/openbazaar_tor_demo/ community demo] for OpenBazaar  was done with Tor by hosting seed nodes as Hidden Services.

== SecureDrop ==
SecureDrop is another widely used whistle-blowing platform installed at many news organizations. To set it up please refer to the [https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/blob/develop/docs/install.md official guide]. To use SecureDrop as a source, refer to this [https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/blob/develop/docs/source_user_manual.md documentation] and for using SecureDrop as a journalist go [https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/blob/develop/docs/journalist_user_manual.md here]. For general information and project code go to their main [https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop Github page].

If you are a news or whistle-blowing site operator you may be interested in having your Hidden Service address listed at the [https://freedom.press/securedrop/directory Freedom of The Press Foundation].

== Sparkleshare ==
For a private and anonymous DropBox alternative you can run [https://guardianproject.info/2013/11/12/your-own-private-dropbox-with-free-software/ Sparkleshare as a Hidden Service]. To ensure that only you and the intended parties can access the service you need to set up Hidden Service Authentication, see [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Hidden_Services#Hidden_Service_Authentication instructions].

== SSH ==
Secure Shell is the dominant protocol for secure remote login and system administration. It is a critical component of server and internet infrastructure. Recent revelations from the Snowden documents and further analysis<ref>https://stribika.github.io/2015/01/04/secure-secure-shell.html</ref> has uncovered weaknesses in some of the included cipher-suites, allowing abuses by resourceful Nation-State adversaries. If you run SSH in this day and age, it should be done from behind a Tor Hidden Service.

Advantages:

*Protection by Tor
*Robust access control provided by Hidden Services authentication<ref>Shields SSH from brute-force attacks and exploit attacks against the SSH server daemon.</ref>
*NAT traversal
*No need for services like DynDNS
 

1. Setup [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Hidden_Services#Hidden_Service_Authentication Hidden Service Authentication]

2. Run SSH like normal or follow this [https://wiki.debian.org/SSH guide] if you are a beginner

== Stormy ==
Stormy is a simple Hidden Service blog setup script. The developer hopes to have it packaged for Debian at some point. You can see it on [https://github.com/glamrock/Stormy Github].

== Syncthing with OnionCat ==
Syncthing is a libre software solution for private file synchronization.

This section will cover file syncing with peers inside the Tor network.

1. Set up [[OnionCat]] on Whonix Gateway. All parties involved will need to configure a Hidden Service with OnionCat because syncing is bidirectional. Make sure you can successfully ping all OnionCat addresses before proceeding.

{{Third_Party_Repository}}

2. Before adding the repo<ref>apt.syncthing.net</ref>, fetch the key and verify<ref>https://syncthing.net/security.html</ref> fingerprints.  '''Always check the fingerprint for yourself.''' The output at the moment is:

<pre>
pub  2048R/0xD26E6ED000654A3E 2014-12-29 Syncthing Release Management <release@syncthing.net>
      Key fingerprint = 37C8 4554 E7E0 A261 E4F7  6E1E D26E 6ED0 0065 4A3E
</pre>

Download key with scurl to home folder.

{{CodeSelect|code=
scurl -o syncthing-pubkey.asc https://syncthing.net/release-key.txt
}}

Check fingerprints/owners without importing anything.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --with-fingerprint syncthing-pubkey.asc
}}

If it looks good import into trusted.gpg.d.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo cp syncthing-pubkey.asc /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/
}}
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://apt.syncthing.net/ syncthing release > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/syncthing-release.list'
}}
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update -qq
}}
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install syncthing
}}

3. Launch Syncthing:
{{CodeSelect|code=
$ syncthing
}}

Do not close the running terminal or Syncthing will shutdown.
Answer 'No' if asked to 'Allow Anonymous Usage Reporting'.

To open the WebGUI, open Iceweasel and paste:
{{CodeSelect|code=
http://127.0.0.1:8384/
}}

Do NOT use Iceweasel for any other purpose because of fingerprinting threats. Opening the WebGUI in TBB won't work because of stream isolation settings.

4. At this point Syncthing back-end should have generated your unique Device ID.
Go to:
<pre>
Actions > Show ID
</pre>

Share the Device ID along with your OnionCat address. As long as one side shares this information the other can add and find them.

5. Once ID information is exchanged, go to <pre>Add Device</pre> and paste the other endpoint's Device ID. Then under '''Addresses''' change ''dynamic'' to <pre>[OnionCat-address]:22000</pre> 

'''Note that you MUST write the OnionCat IPv6 address within brackets for it to work.''' 

Select  the ''default''  directory under '''Share Folders With Device'''.

6. Syncing more than two endpoints can quickly become tedious so select at least one node to be an '''Introducer''' by selecting the option. The Introducer node will inform the new device about all nodes attached to it.

7. Finally drag and drop any files you want to sync to the 'Sync' folder under your Home directory. 

Done.

Note: No one can connect to your swarm without you adding them but you may still want to make your virtual network more private. This is done using '''HiddenServiceAuthorizeClient''' - a Tor feature.

== Torrenting over OnionCat ==

This section will cover torrenting with anonymous peers inside the Tor network. This is a trackerless setup.

'''Seeding'''

1. Set up [[OnionCat]] on Whonix Gateway. All parties involved will need to configure a Hidden Service with OnionCat because torrenting is bidirectional.


2. Next install qBittorrent: 
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install qbittorrent
}}


3. Create your torrent: <pre>Tools > Torrent creator</pre> Add the file/folder you want to share. Leave the Tracker information boxes empty. Insert your OnionCat IPv6 IP into the Comment section.

Check ''Start seeding after creation'' then create and save the torrent file.


4. Share the torrent file on your personal Onion Site blog or some other channel as you normally would.


'''Downloading'''

1. Add the torrent file in qBittorrent

2. Select the the torrent from the list and go to the ''General tab''. Copy the OnionCat IPv6 address from the Comment section.

3. Click the ''Peers'' tab and right-click into the empty tab.  Click ''Add a new peer...'' and paste the IPv6 address. Note that the default listening port for incoming connections is set to 6881 and nothing needs to be done.

Done.



For a private sharing environment you will need to configure Tor to use the HiddenServiceAuthorizeClient option. More on that [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Hidden_Services#Hidden_Service_Authentication here].
