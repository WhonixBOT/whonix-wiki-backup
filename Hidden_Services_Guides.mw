= OpenBazaar =
OpenBazaar supports both TCP and UDP. The latter was added to aid those using it on the clearnet that had difficulties connecting from behind their routers. <ref>https://github.com/OpenBazaar/OpenBazaar/issues/795</ref> When using Tor you don't have to worry about that.

A community demo for OpenBazaar  was done with Tor by hosting seed nodes as Hidden Services <ref>https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenBazaar/comments/2iusp4/openbazaar_tor_demo/</ref>

= Sparkleshare =
For a private and anonymous DropBox alternative using TOR and Sparkleshare, see <ref>https://guardianproject.info/2013/11/12/your-own-private-dropbox-with-free-software/</ref>.
