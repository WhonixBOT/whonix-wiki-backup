=== General VirtualBox Troubleshooting Steps ===
In many situations, the following steps will fix VirtualBox issues.

# Use the [[VirtualBox/Other_Versions#Recommended_Version|recommended]] VirtualBox <u>host</u> software version {{VirtualBox_Version}}.
# To ensure the recommended version of VirtualBox guest additions is installed in Whonix, in both {{gateway_product_name}} and {{workstation_product_name}} run. {{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
}}
# Linux users only: use the recommended host Linux kernel version. That the same version as Debian <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}</code> is using [https://packages.debian.org/buster/linux-image-amd64 <code>linux-image-amd64</code>].
# Linux users only: use the [[Host_Operating_System_Selection#Recommended_Linux_Distribution|recommended]] Linux distribution [https://www.debian.org/ Debian Linux] version <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}</code>.

=== VERR_SSM_FIELD_NOT_CONSECUTIVE ===

If the "{{Code2|Failed to load unit 'PATM' (VERR_SSM_FIELD_NOT_CONSECUTIVE).}}" error appears, {{Code2|VT-x}} must be enabled in BIOS settings, see [[#BIOS|instructions]].

{{Anchor|VT-x_is_disabled_in_the_BIOS.}}
=== VT-x is disabled in BIOS ===

If the following error message appears.

<pre>
Failed to open a session for the virtual machine {{gateway_product_name}}.

VT-x is disabled in the BIOS.
(VERR_VMX_MSR_VMXON_DISABLED).
</pre>

Or.

<pre>
AMD-V is disabled in the BIOS (or by the host OS).
(VERR_SVM_DISABLED).
</pre>

Then [[#BIOS|enable]] {{Code2|VT-x}} in BIOS settings.

{{Anchor|BIOS}}

=== Enable VT-x in BIOS ===
Go to your BIOS settings. For basic instructions, see: https://www.wikihow.com/Change-Computer-BIOS-Settings

Then enable <code>VT-x</code>. This is sometimes also called <code>AMD-V</code>, <code>virtualization</code>, <code>SVM</code> or <code>MIT</code> perhaps under <code>Advanced Core</code> settings.

=== Error In supR3HardenedWinReSpawn ===
[[File:VirtualBox_supR3HardenedWinReSpawn.png|400px]]<br />
Do not update whilst the VMs are running, otherwise [[VirtualBox]] must be reinstalled.

=== INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN GRAIN TABLE AND BACKUP GRAIN TABLE ===

If this error appears, sometimes it helps to:

# Try and convert the vmdk to vdi.
# Remove the old vmdk from the VM.
# Attach the new vdi.

=== VMMR0InitVM: Revision mismatch ===
<pre>
debian kernel: VMMR0InitVM: Revision mismatch, r3=132055 r0=130347
</pre>

This happens when upgrading VirtualBox on the host while existing VMs are still running. The solution is to shut down and restart all VMs.

=== E_INVALIDARG (0x80070057) ===

This might relate to a low disk space issue -- research the issue further with search engines.

=== Import {{project_name}} Images ===

Using the VirtualBox GUI to import {{project_name}} images should work well in most cases. If not, follow the steps below. 
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Check if there is enough free disk space. 

'''2.''' Refer to the {{project_name}} [[Install|Install Screenshots]] and/or [[Videos|Video Tutorials]].

'''3.''' Delete any half-imported or otherwise broken virtual machine images.

'''4.''' Use the VBoxManage command line tool and copy the output.

{{CodeSelect|code=
VBoxManage unregistervm "{{gateway_product_name_short}}-XFCE" --delete
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
VBoxManage unregistervm "{{workstation_product_name_short}}-XFCE" --delete
}}

'''5.''' Navigate to the folder where {{project_name}} was downloaded and import {{gateway_product_name}} and {{workstation_product_name}} by using the VBoxManage command line tool.

{{CodeSelect|code=
VBoxManage import {{gateway_product_name_short}}-XFCE-{{VersionNew}}.ova
}}

'''6.''' Clean (anonymize) the output.

Remove operating system user name or any problematic paths.

'''7.''' [[Contact|Contact lead {{project_name}} developer]] Patrick Schleizer and send the output.
}}

=== Non-functional Shared Clipboard and Drag and Drop ===

If the shared clipboard and drag’n’drop to/from host is non-functional, this can relate to the version of guest additions installed in Whonix and/or the version of VirtualBox running on the host. <ref>
* http://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-15-shared-clipboard-and-dragndrop-not-working/7723
* Upstream bug report: [https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/19336 Linux guest: shared clipboard doesn't work (on fresh VirtualBox-6.1.4-136177) => fixed in 6.1.6]

# Apply [[VirtualBox#General VirtualBox Troubleshooting Steps|General VirtualBox Troubleshooting Steps]].
# <code>VirtualBox</code> &rarr; <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code>General</code> &rarr; <code>Advanced tab</code> &rarr; <code>'Check' shared clipboard and drag and drop</code>

It might still not work, see: [[Dev/VirtualBox#VirtualBox_Guest_Additions_Bugs|VirtualBox Guest Additions Bugs Reporting]].

=== VirtualBox Screen Resolution Bug ===
{{VirtualBox Screen Resolution Bug}}

=== Black Screen ===
If a black screen appears, try the following possible solutions.

# Apply the [[VirtualBox#General VirtualBox Troubleshooting Steps|General VirtualBox Troubleshooting Steps]]. Install the [[VirtualBox/Other_Versions#Recommended_Version|recommended]] version of the VirtualBox host software.
# Reboot.
# If the issue persist, try the following workarounds.

'''Change VirtualBox Virtual Graphics Controller Settings'''

# Power off the VM.
# <code>VirtualBox</code> &rarr; <code>click a VM</code> &rarr; <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code>Display</code> &rarr; <code>Graphics Controller</code> &rarr; <code>VMSVGA</code> &rarr; <code>OK</code> (Or try other settings there.) <ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
VBoxManage modifyvm Whonix-Gateway-XFCE --graphicscontroller vmsvga
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
VBoxManage modifyvm Whonix-Gateway-XFCE --graphicscontroller vboxvga
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
VBoxManage modifyvm Whonix-Gateway-XFCE --graphicscontroller vboxsvga
}}
</ref>
# <code>VirtualBox</code> &rarr; <code>click a VM</code> &rarr; <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code>Display</code> &rarr; <code>Graphics Controller</code> &rarr; <code>increase slider for Video Memory to 128</code> &rarr; <code>OK</code> (This is already the case in newer {{Project name}} versions.)
# Restart the VM.

'''nomodeset kernel parameter'''

Try to [[Grub#Kernel_Boot_Parameter_Change|boot with the <code>nomodeset</code> kernel parameter]]. If that works, please post a forum report and then [[Grub#Permanent_Configuration_Changes|make the change permanent]]. <ref>
http://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-cli-15-0-0-9-4-gateway-shows-a-black-screen/9174/2
</ref>

'''Virtual Console'''
If it is possible to switch to a [[Desktop#Virtual_Consoles|virtual console]], this can help with debugging.

= Assign Less Virtual CPUs =
Try assigning less virtual CPUs. <ref>
VirtualBox ticket: [https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/19500 VirtualBox should now prohibit assigning all physical CPUs to a VM and/or fix VirtualBox CPU assignment manual].
</ref> <ref>
In {{Project name}} <code>15.0.1.3.4</code> and above <code>3</code> virtual CPUs is now the default setting;   <code>4</code> were previously used. As a result, this workaround should no longer be required for most users.
</ref>

# Power off the VM.
# <code>VirtualBox</code> &rarr; <code>click a VM</code> &rarr; <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code>System</code> &rarr; <code>Processor</code> &rarr; <code>Reduce to 3</code> &rarr; <code>OK</code>

Whonix provides VM images that operate inside of the VM. Whatever occurs inside a VM should never lead to a crash (status aborted) of the host virtualization software, VirtualBox.

= Aborted Status =
If the virtual machine ever shows an <code>aborted</code> status, perform these steps:

# Try to [[#Assign Less Virtual CPUs|Assign Less Virtual CPUs]]; this may help to avoid the issue.
# Consider reporting a bug against upstream [https://www.virtualbox.org VirtualBox] -- [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Bugtracker VirtualBox bugtracker] / [https://forums.virtualbox.org VirtualBox forums]. Logs are useful for developers to isolate the problem; see footnote. <ref>[https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=77663#p361694 Reasons of vm to get into "aborted" state]:
<blockquote>
Would you mind sharing with us one of those logs so that we can judge for ourselves? From a machine that got aborted? ZIP it before using the "Upload attachment" at the bottom of your reply form.
</blockquote></ref>
To capture the VirtualBox log:
# <code>VirtualBox</code> &rarr; <code>right click a VM</code> &rarr; <code>Show Log...</code> &rarr; <code>Log</code> &rarr; <code>Save</code> &rarr; <code>OK</code>
# Zip the log.
# Report to VirtualBox support.

= Submit A Bug Report =
When reporting an issue in the [https://forums.whonix.org/ {{Project name}} forums], please add the exact steps which led to the problem. Also include as much relevant information as possible; see below.

* Does the problem resolve itself if {{Gateway product name}} is launched without starting {{Workstation product name}}?
* Which {{project name}} version was downloaded and from where?
* Do both {{Gateway product name}} and {{Workstation product name}} have this issue?
* Did you: 
** Only download, import {{project name}} VMs and start {{project name}}?; or
** Did you start {{project name}}, use {{project name}}, install more software and perform other activities before the black screen issues emerged?
* Have you previously used older versions of {{project name}} that worked?
* What is the host operating system and version?
* What is the VirtualBox version?
* Can you switch to a [[Desktop#Virtual_Consoles|virtual console]]? This can help with debugging.
* How much RAM does the host have?

Bugs can also be reported against upstream [https://www.virtualbox.org VirtualBox]: [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Bugtracker VirtualBox bugtracker] / [https://forums.virtualbox.org VirtualBox forums]. Bug reports must be thorough otherwise it will not lead to a solution, see: [https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=87130#p416223 bug reporting instructions].
