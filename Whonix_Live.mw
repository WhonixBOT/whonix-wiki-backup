= Introduction =

Users can optionally run Whonix as a live system. <ref>
Since Whonix 14.
</ref> Booting into live mode will make all writes  go to RAM instead of the hard disk. Everything that is created / changed / downloaded in the VM during that session will not persist after shutdown. This also holds true for malicious changes made by malware, so long as it did not break out of the virtual machine.

There are two live mode options available, [https://github.com/Whonix/grub-live <code>grub-live</code>] and [https://github.com/Whonix/ro-mode-init <code>ro-mode-init</code>].

* <code>grub-live</code> will create a new boot menu entry which the user has to select manually but it is the more failsafe and hence the recommended option.
* With <code>ro-mode-init</code> the boot menu will stay the same and the system will automatically boot into live mode when it detects a read-only disk otherwise it boots normally into persistent mode.

Live mode is not amnesic; in particular, memory forensics has not been taken into account! The primary objective is preventing malware from gaining persistence and having an unchanged system after each reboot.<br />
<br />
Whonix-Workstation and Whonix-Gateway: It is also recommended to regularly boot into persistent mode for installation of [[Update|updates]].

Whonix-Gateway: If live mode is used with Whonix-Gateway, regularly booting into persistent mode is important to keep Tor's normal [[Tor_Entry_Guards|guard]] rotation schedule.

When Whonix is run as a live system, all changes are written to RAM by default. However, it is possible for this design to be bypassed if swap files, core dumps and other relevant configurations are in effect. Fortunately, most of these can be disabled. <ref>[[FAQ#Is_there_a_Whonix_Amnesic_Feature_.2F_Live_CD_.2F_Live_DVD.3F_What_about_Forensics.3F|Is there a Whonix Amnesic Feature / Live CD / Live DVD? What about Forensics?]]</ref> <ref>[[Warning#Whonix_is_not_Amnesic|Whonix is not Amnesic]]</ref>  <ref>[[Full_Disk_Encryption_and_Encrypted_Images#Other_Security_Considerations|Encrypted Guest Images - Other Security Considerations]]</ref> <ref>[[Core Dumps]]</ref> 

To stymie disk forensics, ideally full disk encryption should be applied on the host and the computer should be powered off when not in use. Alternatively, the whole host OS could be run from RAM, or a live system run on the host with all writes going to RAM. The latter method also requires a correctly implemented write protection switch.

To make memory forensics harder, the machine should either be removed from any power source (by pulling the plug / removing the battery) and/or the memory should be wiped upon shutdown.

= Live-mode Configuration =

== Qubes ==

<code>grub-live</code> is currently [[unsupported]] on [[Qubes]], but may become available in the future. Refer to the following [https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-live-mode/3894/31 forum discussion] for further information.

In Qubes R4, [[Qubes/DisposableVM|Qubes DisposableVMs]] are a suitable alternative, as well as the [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/live-usb/ Qubes Live USB].

== VirtualBox ==

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Backup.
{{Box|text=
'''Option 1:''' Create a snapshot of your VM. '''OR'''
}}

{{Box|text=
'''Option 2:''' Alternatively backup the <code>/boot</code> folder.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo cp -a /boot /boot.back
}}}}
}}

{{Box|text=
'''2.''' Install <code>grub-live</code>.

{{Install Package
|package=grub-live
}}
}}

{{Box|text=
Following reboot, a second boot entry called "Whonix Live-mode" will be visible. Simply press <code>Enter</code> to boot the live system and use it as normal.
}}

{{Box|text=
To increase security, the VM disks can be set to read-only. Otherwise, malware running as root in the VM could theoretically mount the image read-write and gain persistence in this way.

{{Box|text=
1. To do so, power off the machine.

2. From the command line run:

{{CodeSelect|code=
VBoxManage setextradata vmname "VBoxInternal/Devices/lsilogicsas/0/LUN#0/AttachedDriver/Config/ReadOnly" 1
}}

to set the disk to read-only with "vmname" being the name of your virtual machine e.g. Whonix-Gateway.
To boot into normal mode again, simply revert this change via:

{{CodeSelect|code=
VBoxManage setextradata vmname "VBoxInternal/Devices/lsilogicsas/0/LUN#0/AttachedDriver/Config/ReadOnly"
}}

and choose the normal boot option in the GRUB menu.
}}
}}

== KVM ==

{{Whonix Live Backup}}

{{Box|text=
'''2.''' Install <code>grub-live</code>.

{{Install Package
|package=grub-live
}}
}}

Following reboot, a second boot entry called "Whonix Live-mode" will be visible. Simply press <code>Enter</code> to boot the live system and use it as normal.

To increase security, the VM disks can be set to read-only. Otherwise, malware running as root in the VM could theoretically mount the image read-write and gain persistence in this way.
To do so, power off the machine and set the hard disk to read-only in the virt-manager GUI before booting into live mode. To boot into normal mode again, simply revert this change and choose the normal boot option in the GRUB menu.

== Alternative Configurations ==

Skip this section if the [[Whonix Live#KVM|KVM Live-mode]] or [[Whonix Live#VirtualBox|Virtualbox Live-mode]] configuration steps above have already been completed.

Virtualbox and KVM:

* [[Whonix Live/ro-mode-init]]

VirtualBox only:

* [[Whonix Live/Immutable Disk Method on VirtualBox]]

= Debugging/Errors =

An inconsistent filesystem will likely result in errors during live-boot. For instance, inconsistencies can arise when the VM is killed instead of performing a normal shutdown in persistent mode. Therefore, to make sure it is consistent, run <code>fsck</code> in persistent mode. Debian automatically does this during boot. VMs running in live mode can be killed without problems.

In the case of non-<code>fsck</code> related errors using <code>ro-mode-init</code> (like dropping to an initramfs shell), add the following to the kernel command line/GRUB menu for easier debugging:

{{CodeSelect|code=
debug=1 break=init-premount
}}

= Miscellaneous =
In the future, running Whonix from a [[FAQ#Will_there_be_a_Whonix_Live_CD_or_DVD.3F|Live CD or DVD]] might be supported. Check this wiki entry at a later date.
