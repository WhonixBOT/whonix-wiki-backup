= Whonix-Gateway Security =
== General ==
You should never use Whonix-Gateway for anything other than running Tor on it!

In case the Whonix-Gateway is compromised the identity (public IP), all destinations and all clear-text (and hidden service) communication over Tor is available to the attacker.

If you feel you need to install any extra packages on the Gateway please consult the developers first to ask if that is really necessary/wise.

== Warning: Bridged Networking ==
You shouldn't change the Whonix-Gateway's first or second network interface to bridged network. This is untested. It should not be necessary. If you feel it is necessary, please get in [[contact]].

If you are interested, here is a [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/1e6a8675/ discussion thread], and [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/3a0b673a/ another one], with arguments whether NAT or bridged network is more secure.

= Host Security =

== Basics ==

Please read the [[Computer Security Education#Host Security|Computer Security Education about Host Security]].

== Power Saving Considerations ==
Upon system suspend/standby Full Disk Encryption keys are still in RAM - avoid leaving the machine in this state if in high risk situation or on the go. Hibernating the system locks  all system partitions to a safe state and is the recommended power mode to use even if there is a small trade-off in startup time.

On GNU/Linux hosts, its not a given that standby means having LUKS keys in memory. Some experimental projects<ref>https://github.com/jonasmalacofilho/ubuntu-luks-suspend</ref> and custom setups with systemd+scripting are able to erase the keys before system suspend to avoid mistakes.

The network fingerprint for a Tor on Whonix-Gateway is no different than a standard Tor instance on the host that's gone through standby. There are some old connections that go stale and need renewal - but nothing seen by a network adversary because time leak identifiers have been stripped out
of Tor's protocol/OpenSSL and TCP Timestamps are gone. Manual time adjustment has to be done however to be able to reconnect. Alternatively, an easy method would be to power off and power on the VM. This will no longer be necessary once hypervisor specific post resume hooks will be used because guest clocks will be seamlessly updated upon power state changes from the host.

== Risks through hardware components ==

Assumption: an adversary managed to break out of Whonix-Workstation's Virtual Machine using an exploit.

Hardware components, either built in or extra components, such as CPU or hdd temperature sensors, microphones and cameras introduce risks.

Whonix with [[Physical Isolation]] is affected:

* User's IP address is still safe, but the temperature sensors can be used for anonymity set reduction. Different CPU or hdd models will have a different sensor information, depending on climate and weather. If you can, you are advised to remove or to obfuscate the sensors result.
* Camera and microphones can be covertly activated by the adversary. At least remove them (external ones) or disable them in BIOS if possible. Better cover them or ideally remove them.

Whonix Default version is affected, although it does not matter:

* Same as above applies. If the assumption is true, the adversary can already find out the user's real IP address.

Thanks to Robert Ransom for pointing out this issue.

== Anonymous 3G modem ==

Normally your dial up or broadband provider knows your name, postal address and non-anonymous payment method. This is bad. Suppose Tor or Whonix is compromised. An adversary just has to pressure your provider and can very easily find out your identity. This is not the case here.

* Non-physical isolation users: Either 1) Plugged or integrated into the host as host internet connection replacement (easier) or 2) plugged into Whonix-Gateway and only routing Whonix-Gateway's traffic through it, not the host's one (undocumented, therefore harder).
* [[Physical Isolation|Physical Isolation]]: Same as 2) above. (While there is no host in that sense.)
* Buy the 3G modem anonymously (in a store, second hand, on street, no personal data).
* Be sure to have never used it for non-anonymous use before.
** Because in many countries the telecommunication company log the phone serial number (IMEI), the SIM serial number and the phone number for each network login.
* Also be sure to buy the SIM-card anonymously.
* Prepaid is better.
* Buy cash codes in different stores anonymously.
* Be sure, to never have used this anonymous SIM-card with a non-anonymous phone or 3G modem.
** Because in many countries the telecommunication company log the phone serial number (IMEI), the SIM serial number and the phone number for each network login.
** Optionally, always get a fresh, distant, random, non-circle spot. (security vs. comfort)
** Check of cameras and witnesses.
* 3G users often get only a shared IP. Due to scarcity of IPv4 IP's, thousands of users share the same external IP (IPv4). Some providers do not log yet user's (NAT) ports. Consequently they can not identify them, when they are given an IP and timestamp. Nice to have, but don't rely on it! (Some providers assign additional IPv6 IP's to their users, which are unique. Tor does not use IPv6 yet.)

== Anonymous WiFi adapter ==

Normally your dial up or broadband provider knows your name, postal address and non-anonymous payment method. This is bad. Suppose Tor or Whonix is compromised. An adversary just has to pressure your provider and can very easily find out your identity. This is not the case here.

* Plugged or integrated into Whonix-Gateway.
* Buy the wifi adapter anonymously (In a store, second hand, on street, no personal data).
* Be sure to have never used it for non-anonymous use before.
** Because a few providers or hotspot providers log the MAC address and the username (for paid hotspots) for each dial up.
* Use only free hotspots or pay them anonymously (if that's possible, otherwise abstain from paid hotspots).
** Optionally, always get a fresh, distant, random, non-circle spot. (security vs. comfort)
** Check cameras and witnesses.

For an overview on security risks of VMs in general: [http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/3056/how-secure-are-virtual-machines-really-false-sense-of-security How secure are Virtual Machines really?]

The less features, the smaller the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface attack surface]. Here are some suggestions for features which you can remove and not impact core functionality:

* Disable Audio
* Do not enable Shared Folders
* Do not enable video acceleration
* Do not enable 3d acceleration <ref>
Quote http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#guestadd-3d
<blockquote>
Untrusted guest systems should not be allowed to use VirtualBox's 3D acceleration features, just as untrusted host software should not be allowed to use 3D acceleration. Drivers for 3D hardware are generally too complex to be made properly secure and any software which is allowed to access them may be able to compromise the operating system running them. In addition, enabling 3D acceleration gives the guest direct access to a large body of additional program code in the VirtualBox host process which it might conceivably be able to use to crash the virtual machine.

* Do not enable Serial Port
* Remove Floppy drive

= Whonix-Workstation Security =

== Introduction ==

If this VM is compromised all data it has access to, all credentials, browser data, passwords... the user has entered can be compromised. The IP is never leaked but these information can still result in identity disclosure.

The best practice is to back up the VM and "roll back" after risky activity and whenever the user suspect the integrity of the system could have been compromised, see the ''Recommendation to use multiple VM Snapshots'' below.

''Whonix Example Implementation'' is currently based on Debian.

For Technical Design notes, see [[Dev/Operating System]]. For information on how to use other operating systems, see [[Other Operating Systems]].

{{Anchor|Recommendation to use multiple VM Snapshots}}
== VM Snapshots ==
Apart from offering protection against hardware serial leaks, VMs got another great advantage: the ability to quickly discard and restore a system.

It is recommended that you keep a master copy of Whonix-Workstation, keep it updated, make regular "clean" snapshots but do not edit any settings or install additional software or use it directly for any activity. Instead make a clone or use snapshotting (but never mix up clean and unclean states!) for activities that require anonymity.

After importing the VMs, do a first run of the Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation virtual machines. [[Update|Securely update it]]. After that stop and do not browse anywhere or open any unauthenticated communication channel to the internet. Shutdown the virtual machines and create snapshots of their clean state before browsing or initiating any connections with the outside world. Note: The only exception to this is running apt which has a guaranteed way to securely download and verify packages.

'''Warning to VirtualBox users''': VirtualBox's VM Snapshot feature is recommended against, because [https://www.whonix.org/old-forum/index.php/topic,97.msg1586.html#msg1586 we experienced] data loss with it. You're better off using clones or see "Reliable Alternative To Virtualbox VM Snapshots" below.
{{Anchor|Reliable Alternative To Virtualbox VM Snapshots}}
{{Anchor|Reliable Alternative To VirtualBox VM Snapshots}}

Warning: VirtualBox's snapshot feature is not (highly) recommended as a reliable method for backing up virtual machines because of possible data loss primarily in the form of corrupted virtual hard drives [VHD]. Alternative methods are copy/paste, cloning, exporting/importing. While all these methods provide virtual machine [VM] backups, they nevertheless make inefficient use of disk resources and inherently require manual versioning. Virtualbox's 'snapshot' feature is very useful when it works properly particularly when making interim snapshots of live running systems prior to installing new application(s), reverting can be very painful, and sometimes impossible, if/when virtual hard drive file(s) is corrupted.

Alternative to methods mentioned above, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion_(software) SubVersioN [SVN<nowiki>]</nowiki>] in particular is a very reliable tool with which to make backups of VM operating environments. It is akin to Virtualbox's snapshot feature in many respects but much more reliable and efficient. For those that have never used SVN, it is recommended they familiarize themselves with the tool's [https://subversion.apache.org/docs/ documentation] - what it is/isn't and how it works prior to making use of it. Numerous implementations of SVN [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Subversion_clients clients] are available to choose from for various platforms.

What is SVN? In a nutshell, SVN is a tool typically used by software developers to conduct collaborative configuration management, version control and backup/restore of file sets under development by many people over extended period of time.

Why SVN as opposed to CVS, GIT, etc.? While most configuration management tools, including SVN, offer the same basic functionality of versioning, backing up and restoring changes to sets of files, by design SVN has no file size limitations - the operative words are "by design". This means when used to back up virtual hard drives for example, regardless of how big or small the files are SVN can handle them reliably and efficiently. See section [http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/doc/user/svn-best-practices.html "Be patient with large files" (link)]. When versioning file sets, SVN employs [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_commit "atomic commits"]. By way of comparison, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System Concurrent Versions System (CVS)] does not employ [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_commit atomic commits]. Manual backup procedures are inherently not [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_commit atomic functions]. Additionally, SVN also handles [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_file sparse (dynamic)] virtual hard disk files (an option Virtualbox offers when [http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html#gui-createvm instantiating new virtual disk drives]).

From version to version, like Virtualbox's snapshot capability, SVN also takes into consideration differences in files - both textual and binary. This means, for example, if a 50GB virtual hard drive was saved last week and has grown to 60GB this week, SVN's repository will not [necessarily] grow by an additional 60GB when a new back up is performed this week - it depends how much of the original file changed since the previous backup. It will analyse differences between newer files against older files in its repository and only save differences. Therefore the repository may only grow as little as 10GB+ making more efficient use of system resources.

Virtualbox's snapshot feature provides [http://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&p=123806 'branching'] capability. This means, one can revert to an earlier version of your VM and start a new branch/version of your VM from where you left off earlier. By comparison, SVN also provides similar [http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.branchmerge.html branching] capability. 

NOTE: When using configuration management tools like SVN for back ups and restores, a 50GB file for example typically requires approximately 150GB of disk space to manage that instance of the VM because you require 50GB for the original source file, 50GB in SVN's database [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion#Repository_types repository], and another 50GB for SVN's [http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.6/svn.tour.initial.html local workspace] working folder ['./.svn']. How is this more efficient? In that sense, it is not. However, when you consider SVN's functionality and reliability compared to manual backup methods mentioned above, this overhead might be considered an investment.

In addition to backing up Whonix gateway and workstation(s) virtual hard drive files, it is also possible to back up the whole of Virtualbox application in conjunction with Whonix for a complete restoreable environment. Cloning is also possible albeit that requires more advance technical skills.

Typically, Virtualbox is an installable application as provided by [http://www.virtualbox.org Virtualbox.org]. A [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_application portable application] version of Virtualbox is possible via a tool provided by [http://www.vbox.me VBox.me]. This application converts Virtualbox 'install application' into a 'portable application' thereby providing the option to port VMs to other computers via external USB hard drives and/or sticks. By instantiating virtual machines under portable Virtualbox's '~/data/.VirtualBox/Machines' folder, it is possible to backup and restore the complete operating environment not only that of Whonix but also specific instance of Virtualbox as well via SVN for complete portability. This encapsulates the entire Whonix operating environment under one parent folder rather than distributing it across various user and system folders:

== Adding NAT adapter to Whonix-Workstation / Updates without Tor ==

Obviously the anonymity will get compromised if you add another NAT network adapter to the Whonix-Workstation. It is quite clear not to do that. If you were infected, it could leak then. Therefore it's recommended to do updates over Tor. It's slow but there are no leaks.

== Adding Host-Only Networking adapter to Whonix-Workstation / SSH into Whonix-Workstation ==
One might wish to access the Whonix-Workstation through SSH. Therefore one could consider something dangerous - to add a second network adapter with [http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#network_hostonly Host-Only Networking]. Dangerous! Don't add another network adapter! Also potentially dangerous if any other VMs are running besides Whonix-Workstation! This would expose the MAC address of your host to Whonix-Workstation.

The warning of VMware Host Only networking may also apply to Whonix:

''"If you install the proper routing or proxy software on your host computer, you can establish a connection between the host virtual Ethernet adapter and a physical network adapter on the host computer. This allows you, for example, to connect the virtual machine to a Token Ring or other non-Ethernet network.''

''On a Windows 2000, Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 host computer, you can use host-only networking in combination with the Internet connection sharing feature in Windows to allow a virtual machine to use the host's dial-up networking adapter or other connection to the Internet. See your Windows documentation for details on configuring Internet connection sharing."''

# If you want to SSH or VNC your Whonix-Workstation your safest bet would be to do it from another Whonix-Workstation. When using Virtual Machines, if they are within the same virtual LAN, they can see each other. When using [[Physical Isolation]], if they are within the same LAN, they can see each other.
# Or you could run those services using [[Hidden Services]] and access them through another Whonix-Workstation...
# ...or from the host using the ordinary torification methods.
# Alternatively you could SSH from the host into Whonix-Gateway (see [[File Transfer]] for instructions) and SSH from there [[File_Transfer#SSH_into_Whonix-Workstation|into Whonix-Workstation]].

In case 3 and 4, you would weaken isolation between the host and Whonix-Workstation.

= Installing additional software =

See [[Install Software]].

= Updating with extra care =

See [[Install Software#How to install or update with most caution?|How to install or update with most caution?]].

= Onionizing Repositories =
When Whonix, Debian and Qubes packages are installed or updated, default settings point to repositories with a http:// URI.<ref>https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Whonix-APT-Repository#Repository_Location_URI</ref> However, experimental .onion support is already available for both Whonix and Debian packages, with Qubes .onion mirrors planned for the near-term.<ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/onionizing-qubes-whonix-repositories/3265</ref><ref>https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Install_Software#How_to_install_or_update_with_most_caution.3F</ref>

Whonix 14 will prefer .onion repositories by default, even when adding third-party resources. Until then, in order to install or update with the utmost caution, users may consider manually editing their sources.list to point to the Whonix and Debian .onion mirrors. There are several security and privacy benefits of this approach:<ref>https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-heart-apt-transport-tor-and-debian-onions</ref>

* The user cannot be uniquely targeted for malicious updates (attackers are forced to attack everyone requesting the update);
* The package repository, or observers watching it, can't track what programs you've installed;
* The ISP cannot easily learn what packages you fetch; and
* End-to-end authentication and encryption provides protection against man-in-the-middle attacks e.g. version downgrade attacks.


To use the .onion mirrors, it is necessary to change the whonix.list and debian.list files in the /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory in both the Whonix-Workstation and Whonix-Gateway TemplateVMs. tor:// or tor:// + http:// entries are not required in Whonix because apt is uwt-wrapped.

'''1. Open the Debian sources file in an editor with root rights.'''

[[Qubes-Whonix]] users note: You should do that in the TemplateVMs whonix-gw and whonix-ws.

If you are using a graphical Whonix or Qubes-Whonix, run:

        kdesudo kwrite /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list

If you are using a terminal-only Whonix, run:

        sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list

'''2. Cut and paste the following .onion mirrors and comment out (#) the corresponding http repositories.'''

        #deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian jessie main contrib non-free
        deb http://vwakviie2ienjx6t.onion/debian jessie main contrib non-free

        # deb http://security.debian.org jessie/updates main contrib non-free
        deb http://sgvtcaew4bxjd7ln.onion jessie/updates main contrib non-free

        #Optional Backports
        #deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian jessie-backports main contrib non-free
        deb http://vwakviie2ienjx6t.onion/debian jessie-backports main contrib non-free

Save and exit.

'''3. Point to the Whonix APT Repository .onion mirror.'''

        sudo whonix_repository --baseuri http://deb.kkkkkkkkkk63ava6.onion --enable --repository stable

Note: Whonix users have four preferences available for packages: stable, stable-proposed-updates, testers and developers. Change the entry above to reflect this preference.<ref>https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Whonix-APT-Repository#Whonix_APT_Repository_Overview</ref>

'''4. Check the .onions are correct and functional in your Whonix system.'''

        sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

'''5. Repeat steps 1-4 for Whonix-Workstation.'''

Note: Qubes users can repeat the steps above in their Debian-8 TemplateVM to onionize future installations and updates.

'''6. ''Optional'' - create an onionized torproject.list.'''

If you are using a graphical Whonix or Qubes-Whonix, run:

        kdesudo kwrite /etc/apt/sources.list.d/torproject.list

If you are using a terminal-only Whonix, run:

        sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/torproject.list

Cut and paste the following text and comment out (#) the corresponding http repository:

        #Tor Project Mirror
        #deb http://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org jessie main
        deb http://sdscoq7snqtznauu.onion/torproject.org jessie main

Save and exit.

= Other Anonymizing Networks over Tor UDP Tunnel =

If you are [[Tunnel UDP over Tor|Tunneling UDP over Tor]] to connect to [[Other Anonymizing Networks]] you must read this chapter, otherwise you can skip this one.

Read first: [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN Tor Plus VPN or Proxy] and [[Whonix:General_disclaimer#Whonix_VPN_disclaimer|Whonix VPN disclaimer]].

You should beware that because you need to install additional tunnel software (OpenVPN, etc.), once exploits are found, an attacker could target them.

However, when you are using a secure tunnel software (for example, OpenVPN, not PPTP), the Tor exit relay may not read your communication with the VPN provider. It can only recognize, a encrypted VPN connection to the VPN provider.

The VPN provider can find out, depending on the other anonymizing network design, that you are connecting to that network. The VPN provider won't know who you are, but can find out, that someone is connecting over Tor.

The encryption of the tunnel software is not relevant, because the other anonymizing network most likely will make use of encryption itself. Subsequently neither the Tor exit relay nor the VPN provider will know the content of your other anonymizing network connection. The usefulness of the information, the Tor exit relay and the VPN provider can gather, is minimal.

"Normally Tor switches frequently its path through the network. When you choose a permanent destination X, you give away this advantage, which may have serious repercussions for your anonymity." as mentioned applies.

It's recommended to use a dedicated virtual machine for this activity, see [[Multiple Whonix-Workstations]].
