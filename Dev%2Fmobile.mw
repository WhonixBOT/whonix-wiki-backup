= CopperheadOS =

* Security focused Android
* (Being discussed by Tor Project as well: https://blog.torproject.org/mission-improbable-hardening-android-security-and-privacy)
** Using the Tor Project Copperhead version requires patience and technical skills
** Probably not suitable for average daily usage 
* Freedom restricted by software vendor: [https://github.com/copperhead/bugtracker/issues/236 root access refused]!
** su is only available in user debug builds, so very few users are actually capable of obtaining root on their own devices.
