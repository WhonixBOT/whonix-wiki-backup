During Whonix's build process, first a Debian raw image is created using grml-debootstrap. A raw image and not qcow2, vdi or vmdk, because creating a bootable raw image is difficult and there are no tools yet to create a qcow2, vdi or vmdk image from scratch.

When (also) using the --vbox switch, the raw image gets converted to vdi. Then a VirtualBox virtual machine is created, the vdi added to it and exported. During export, VirtualBox unfortunately converts it to vmdk.

When (also) using the --qcow2 switch, the raw image gets converted to qcow2.

Maintenance effort definition: Images need to be build, tested, signed, uploaded, maintained (updates), supported (triage bugs, answer questions).

Maintenance effort currently includes 4 images.

* Whonix-Gateway 32 bit ova
* Whonix-Workstation 32 bit ova
* Whonix-Gateway 32 bit libvirt
* Whonix-Workstation 32 bit libvirt

Soon there will be also an empty [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/183 Whonix-Custom-Workstation]. Maintenance effort will include 6.

* Whonix-Gateway 32 bit ova
* Whonix-Workstation 32 bit ova
* Whonix-Custom-Workstation ova
* Whonix-Gateway 32 bit libvirt
* Whonix-Workstation 32 bit libvirt
* Whonix-Custom-Workstation libvirt

Although build time, upload time and maintenance effort for Whonix-Custom-Workstation won't add up so much.

If Whonix offered official 64 bit builds, maintenance effort would multiply two times.

Maintenance effort would include 10 images.

* Whonix-Gateway 32 bit ova
* Whonix-Gateway 64 bit ova
* Whonix-Workstation 32 bit ova
* Whonix-Workstation 64 bit ova
* Whonix-Custom-Workstation ova
* Whonix-Gateway 32 bit libvirt
* Whonix-Gateway 64 bit libvirt
* Whonix-Workstation 32 bit libvirt
* Whonix-Workstation 64 bit libvirt
* Whonix-Custom-Workstation libvirt
