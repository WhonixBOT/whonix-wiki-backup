= Basics =
During Whonix's build process, first a Debian raw image is created using grml-debootstrap. A raw image and not qcow2, vdi or vmdk, because creating a bootable raw image is difficult and there are no tools yet to create a qcow2, vdi or vmdk image from scratch.

When (also) using the --vbox switch, the raw image gets converted to vdi. Then a VirtualBox virtual machine is created, the vdi added to it and exported. During export, VirtualBox unfortunately converts it to vmdk.

When (also) using the --qcow2 switch, the raw image gets converted to qcow2.

Maintenance effort definition: Images need to be build, tested, signed, uploaded, maintained (updates), supported (triage bugs, answer questions).

= 32 bit vs 64 bit =
64 bit builds can not be run on 32 bit computers, can not be run on computers without pae.

64 bit libvirt builds could probably not run in qemu on 32 bit computers.

= Current Situation =
Maintenance effort currently includes 4 images.

* Whonix-Gateway 32 bit ova
* Whonix-Workstation 32 bit ova
* Whonix-Gateway 32 bit libvirt
* Whonix-Workstation 32 bit libvirt

= With new Whonix-Custom-Workstation =
Soon there will be also an empty [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/183 Whonix-Custom-Workstation]. Maintenance effort will include 6.

* Whonix-Gateway 32 bit ova
* Whonix-Workstation 32 bit ova
* Whonix-Custom-Workstation ova
* Whonix-Gateway 32 bit libvirt
* Whonix-Workstation 32 bit libvirt
* Whonix-Custom-Workstation libvirt

Although build time, upload time and maintenance effort for Whonix-Custom-Workstation won't add up so much.

= With 64 bit builds =
If Whonix offered official 64 bit builds, maintenance effort would multiply two times.

Maintenance effort would include 10 images.

* Whonix-Gateway 32 bit ova
* Whonix-Gateway 64 bit ova
* Whonix-Workstation 32 bit ova
* Whonix-Workstation 64 bit ova
* Whonix-Custom-Workstation ova
* Whonix-Gateway 32 bit libvirt

* Whonix-Workstation 32 bit libvirt
* Whonix-Workstation 64 bit libvirt
