<u>[[Kicksecure|{{kicksecure}}]]: A Security-hardened, Non-anonymous Linux Distribution.</u>

=== Intro ===

This is the KVM flavor of the {{Kicksecure}} project - a hardened and security centric version of Debian optimized for virtualized environments and <u>clearnet usage</u>. Much of the warnings and use case instructions from the {{Project name}} edition, such as running the OS [[KVM#Command_Line_Interface_.28CLI.29|headlessly]] or using [[KVM#Shared_Folders|shared folders]], are applicable.

For more details about {{Kicksecure}}, check [[Kicksecure|these]] [[Kicksecure/About|pages]].

Support tickets should be forwarded to the [https://forums.whonix.org/c/kvm KVM subforum].

=== Build from Scratch ===

Advanced users are encouraged to [[Dev/Build_Documentation|build]] {{Kicksecure}} images for high security assurance.

{{Anchor|Verify the {{Kicksecure}} Images}}

=== Verify the {{Kicksecure}} Image ===
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Download [https://www.whonix.org/hulahoop.asc HulaHoop]'s [[OpenPGP]] key from the website.

{{CodeSelect|code=
curl {{Curl Secure}} https://www.whonix.org/hulahoop.asc -o hulahoop.asc
}}

'''2.''' Check fingerprints/owners without importing anything. <ref>
https://forums.whonix.org/t/gpg-show-key-warning-gpg-warning-no-command-supplied-trying-to-guess-what-you-mean/7859
</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --keyid-format long --import --import-options show-only --with-fingerprint hulahoop.asc
}}

'''3.''' Verify the output.

The output should be identical to the following. 

<pre>
pub   rsa4096/50C78B6F9FF2EC85 2018-11-26 [SCEA]
      Key fingerprint = 04EF 2F66 6D36 C354 058B  9DD4 50C7 8B6F 9FF2 EC85
uid                            HulaHoop
sub   rsa4096/EB27D2F8CEE41ACC 2018-11-26 [SEA]
</pre>

'''4.''' Import the key.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --import hulahoop.asc
}}

The output should confirm the key was imported.

<pre>
gpg: key 0x50C78B6F9FF2EC85: public key "HulaHoop" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
</pre>

<u>If the {{project name}} signing key was already imported in the past</u>, the output should confirm the key is unchanged.

<pre>
gpg: key 0x50C78B6F9FF2EC85: "HulaHoop" not changed
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:              unchanged: 1
</pre>

'''5.''' ''Optional:'' For extra assurance, verify the key was also signed by [[Patrick_Schleizer|Patrick Schleizer]].

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --check-sigs "04EF 2F66 6D36 C354 058B 9DD4 50C7 8B6F 9FF2 EC85"
}}

The output should be identical to the message below.

<pre>
pub   rsa4096/0x50C78B6F9FF2EC85 2018-11-26 [SCEA]
      04EF2F666D36C354058B9DD450C78B6F9FF2EC85
uid                   [ unknown] HulaHoop
sig!         0x8D66066A2EEACCDA 2018-12-14  Patrick Schleizer <adrelanos@riseup.net>
sig!3        0x50C78B6F9FF2EC85 2018-11-26  HulaHoop
sub   rsa4096/0xEB27D2F8CEE41ACC 2018-11-26 [SEA]
sig!         0x50C78B6F9FF2EC85 2018-11-26  HulaHoop

gpg: 3 good signatures
</pre>

If the following message appears at the end of the output.

<pre>
gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found
</pre>

Analyze the other messages as usual. This extra message does not relate to the {{Kicksecure}} signing key itself, but instead usually means the user has not created an OpenPGP key yet, which is of no importance when verifying virtual machine images.

'''6.''' Verify the archive with Hulahoop's key.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --verify Kicksecure*.libvirt.xz.asc Kicksecure*.libvirt.xz
}}

The output should include the following text.

<pre>
gpg: Good signature from "HulaHoop"
</pre>
}}

=== Decompress ===

Use {{Code2|tar}} to decompress the archive.

{{CodeSelect|code=
tar -xvf Kicksecure*.libvirt.xz
}}

Do not use {{Code2|unxz}}! Extract the images using {{Code2|tar}}.


== Importing {{Kicksecure}} VM Template ==

The supplied XML files serve as a description for libvirt and define the properties of a {{Kicksecure}} VM and the networking it should have.
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' {{Kicksecure}} works with the network named ''default'' out of the box.


'''2.''' Import the {{Kicksecure}} image.

{{CodeSelect|code=
virsh -c qemu:///system define Kicksecure*.xml
}}
}}

== Moving the {{Kicksecure}} Image File ==

The XML files are configured to point to the default storage location of <code>/var/lib/libvirt/images</code>. The following steps move the images there so the machines can boot.

<u>Note:</u> Changing the default location may cause conflicts with SELinux, which will prevent the machines from booting.

It is recommended to move the image file instead of copying it.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo mv Kicksecure*.qcow2 /var/lib/libvirt/images/Kicksecure.qcow2
}}
