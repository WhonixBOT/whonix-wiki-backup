'''DEPRECATED'''

SecBrowser ™ has been deprecated. It is now [[unsupported]]. For those who still have it installed, it will continue to function. So will its internal updater. There is <u>no</u> urgent rush stop using it. However, it is recommended to stop using SecBrowser ™. Soon SecBrowser ™ start page will be updated to notify users about its deprecation.

Consequences:

* No bug reports / feature requests will be accepted.
* No support requests will be answered.
* No further development.

Reasons for deprecation:

* In the future, it will not be installed by default in [[Kicksecure|{{Kicksecure}}]]
** Quote [[Dev/Kicksecure Default Browser|Kicksecure Default Browser development considerations]]
*** <blockquote>SecBrowser (a browser providing better privacy when browsing clearnet) will not be installed by default in Kicksecure because of grave usability issues, namely its window bar is still saying "Tor Browser" rather than Firefox or SecBrowser. That would be too confusing for new users of Kicksecure. Also Chromium is more secure than SecBrowser. See also these [[Dev/Chromium|Chromium considerations]].</blockquote>
* Too high development effort.
