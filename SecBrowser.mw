SecBrowser ™ has been deprecated and is now [[unsupported]]. It will continue to function for users who still have it installed, as will its internal updater. There is <u>no</u> urgent need to stop using it, but that action is recommended. The SecBrowser ™ start page will soon be updated to notify users about its deprecation. For replacement recommendations, see: [[Host Browser|Host Browser Advice]].

Consequences:

* No bug reports / feature requests will be accepted.
* No support requests will be answered.
* No further development.

Deprecation reasons:

* In the future, it will not be installed by default in [[Kicksecure|{{Kicksecure}}]].
** Quote [[Dev/Kicksecure Default Browser|Kicksecure Default Browser development considerations]]:  <blockquote>SecBrowser (a browser providing better privacy when browsing clearnet) will not be installed by default in Kicksecure because of grave usability issues, namely its window bar is still saying "Tor Browser" rather than Firefox or SecBrowser. That would be too confusing for new users of Kicksecure. Also Chromium is more secure than SecBrowser. See also these [[Dev/Chromium|Chromium considerations]].</blockquote>
* The development effort is too high.
