=Introduction=
Insecure time synchronization clients and clock leaks open the way for all kinds of attacks on systems. Leak vectors are described and techniques are discussed to fully mitigate these attacks.

==Attacks==

'''Replay Attacks''' 
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
Replaying older time allows:
* Feeding old Tor consensus.<ref>https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/Time_syncing/</ref>
* Feeding old/outdated/known vulnerable updates and (https) certificates. Cryptographic verification depends on system clock, i.e. a clock two years in past will accept certificates/updates, which have been expired/revoked for two years.

'''Remote Device Fingerprinting''' 
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
* Clock leaks from software on the host and clock leaks from application-level protocols on Whonix-Workstation allow a passive adversary to easily link the anonymous and non-anonymous traffic to the same machine. Active clock skew attacks can trivially be mounted to deanonymize users.<ref>

==Clock-Leak Vectors==

Certain properties of protocols leak clock information.<ref>http://caia.swin.edu.au/talks/CAIA-TALK-080728A.pdf</ref>

* '''NTP clients:''' Leak host time.<ref>https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/16659#comment:13</ref> Expose the system to all the types of attacks listed above. 

* '''TCP Timestamps:'''  Leak system information down to the millisecond. Leak system uptime. Allow fingerprinting of devices behind a router. Included in every TCP packet. <ref>https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-December/004520.html</ref>

* '''ICMP Timestamps:''' Leak host time in query replies.<ref>http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/protocol/icmp/msg13.htm</ref>

* '''TCP Initial Sequence Numbers (ISNs):''' Even without fully leaking the host's clock, timers can be sources of side-channel attacks because they leak sensitive information about a system's CPU activity. <ref>
https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/16659#comment:10
</ref> This information is leaked in any traffic sent over the clearnet and can be linked to maliciously induced load patterns on an Onion Site leading to deanonymization.<ref>
https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/16659
</ref>

* '''Application-level traffic:''' Unlike privacy software developed by the Tor Project, internet-facing applications can leak clock information in their traffic. For example JS in browsers and timestamps in emails.

==Mitigation==

Its possible and practical to block all the clock leak vectors listed above. Its highly recommended for users needing a very high-level security and those running Onion Services to apply these measures.

On a GNU/Linux Host:

<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed" style="width:800px">
* Uninstall any NTP clients and disable systemd's timdatectl NTP synchronization feature.<ref>http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/timedatectl.html</ref>
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo timedatectl set-ntp 0
}}

or 

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl disable systemd-timesyncd.service
}}
</div>
</div>
<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed" style="width:800px">
* Disable TCP Timestamps via kernel sysctl. Note this boolean disables it for both IPv4 and IPv6 - both are controlled by the same sysctl option.
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
Become root.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo su
}}

You need to add the following line to {{Code2|/etc/sysctl.conf}} or {{Code2|/etc/sysctl.d/tcp_timestamps.conf}}:

{{CodeSelect|code=
net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 0
}}

To do that, you could use the following command.

{{CodeSelect|code=
echo "net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 0" > /etc/sysctl.d/tcp_timestamps.conf
}}

To apply the sysctl settings without reboot, run the following command.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sysctl -p
}}

Check if it's really set.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sysctl -a | grep net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps
}}
</div>
</div>
<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed" style="width:800px">
* Block incoming ICMP messages (and any traffic in general) with iptables or any of its frontends.<ref>https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-setup-a-firewall-with-ufw-on-an-ubuntu-and-debian-cloud-server</ref>
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install ufw
}}
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo ufw enable
}}
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo ufw default deny incoming

You can check the status of UFW:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo ufw status

* <s>TCP Initial Sequence Numbers mitigation.</s>
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
<s>To mitigate TCP ISNs you must avoid sending any traffic clearnet.<ref>http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Sep-2011/msg00060.html</ref> It is good practice to avoid exposing the host to the hostile environment of the internet. TCP ISNs cannot be exploited through Tor directly by malicious clients because Tor transports TCP streams, not IP packets and so ends up automatically scrubbing a lot of the potential information leaks. An exception is a malicious guard node colluding with a large network adversary which can abuse this vector at the Tor protocol level and match this information with leaked timestamps from Whonix-Workstation. A fix is discussed for Tor and possibly for the Linux kernel.<ref>https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/16659</ref> From the outside, this vector cannot be abused for torrified connections by passive network adversaries. The only necessary external connection from the host is the system updater which can be safely torrified with the ''apt-transport-tor'' package on Debian. SSH should only ever run as an [[Hidden_Services#Hidden_Service_Authentication|Authenticated]] [[Hidden_Services_Guides#SSH|Hidden Service]].</s> <ref>https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,1468.msg9246.html#msg9246</ref>

* Application-level  mitigation.
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
For application-level leak mitigation, the same advice as TCP ISNs applies. Without clock information leaking from the host, network adversaries have no non-anonymous timestamp sources to match this data with even when software on Whonix-Workstation misbehaves.

==Whonix Solutions and Limitations==

Whonix implements a secure time synchronization mechanism to replace NTP called sdwdate<ref>https://github.com/Whonix/sdwdate</ref>. Timesync<ref>https://github.com/Whonix/timesync</ref> is the GUI front-end. It was written with safety in mind and to avoid the many security pitfalls in NTP. NTP is also UDP based and cannot work over Tor. Onion Services must have an accurate clock to be reachable.

Sdwdate fetches its time exclusively from reputable sources (Whistle-blowing and Privacy friendly Onion Sites) that are highly likely to be hosted on different hardware. All while benefiting from Tor's end-to-end encryption.

Sdwdate can only protect against passive timestamp linking of data leaking from both the host and Whonix-Workstation but it cannot defend against an active attacker that compromises Whonix-Workstation. They will be able to see the host clock when the VM is rebooted and link the time readings with host clock leaks. The only way to prevent this attack and many others is stop the leaks.
