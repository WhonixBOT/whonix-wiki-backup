Google authenticator is the most popular 2FA application 

TODO: image of Google authenticator.

Users tend to loose 2FA backup codes.

TODO: image of a 2FA backup code.

Users tend to not backup 2FA backup codes since no (popular) services enforces <ref>
Like bitcoin wallets enforce retyping the wallet mnemonic seed.
</ref> backups. Or users loose their 2FA backup codes and then when they loose the device used to generate 2FA codes, they will lock themselves out.

Common misconception: Google 2FA backup login codes cannot restore 2FA for services other than google. These are only a way to login into a google account after having lost access to the 2FA device.

Google authenticator doesn't have a backup function.

Popularly used 2FA is not:

* [[YubiKey]]
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYS '''''W'''hat '''Y'''ou '''S'''ee '''I'''s '''W'''hat '''Y'''ou '''S'''ign'' (<code>WYSIWYS</code>)].

When does 2FA work:

* When users fail victim to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spear-phishing#Spear_phishing spear] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing phishing], i.e. when they send their login password (and maybe even 2FA code) by e-mail to an attacker. By the time the attacker receives the message, the 2FA code is either missing (not sent by user) or if the user is lucky, already expired.
* It results in weakly protected logins due to weak passwords getting stronger.
* A [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder_surfing_%28computer_security%29 shoulder surfed] password alone is not enough to login.

When does 2FA not work:

* When the user's device is already infected by [[malware]]. In that case a trojan horse can simply take over the login session without the user's knowledge.

Possible de-anonymization when using the following apps on a non-torified device:

* authy requires an internet connection
* Symantec VIP requires an internet connection

Google authenticator desktop application replacement:

[[keepassxc]] can be used as a replacement for Google Authenticator (actually TTOP, Time based One Time Password) on desktop computers on Windows, Qubes OS (recommended), Linux (recommended) or Mac.
