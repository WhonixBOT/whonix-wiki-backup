'''UNFINISHED'''

= Installation =
Apart from these hints, installing monero in Whonix does not differ from installing monero on any Linux based distribution.

Advanced [[Qubes]] users could look into [https://getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/cli_wallet_daemon_isolation_qubes_whonix.html CLI Wallet/Daemon Isolation with Qubes + Whonix] <ref>
[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/qubes-users/monero%7Csort:date/qubes-users/CKB_drF16Tw/dntMLZ1aBwAJ qubes-users - Guide: Monero wallet/daemon isolation w/qubes+whonix]
</ref> - untested by Whonix developers.

<ref>
Only <code>monerod</code> is currently available from Debian backports. Monero GUI is not yet available from packages.debian.org.

{{Install Backport|package=

[[Update]] your package lists.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}

Install dependencies. <ref>
Package <code>qtbase5-dev</code> and the following packages are required if you want to use monero-gui.

Use Tor Browser, go to monero download page https://getmonero.org/downloads/ and download monero. <ref>
We avoid wget, since that does not enforce https.
</ref> <ref>
We avoid scurl, since there is no redirecting stable link. TODO: can probably be resolved by telling curl to follow redirects.

= Architecture =

Monero works by having contributors host large files which are equivalent to a public ledger. Any time someone broadcasts a transaction, every ledger maintainer updates their copy of the ledger and ensures no cheating or fraud has occurred. as with most cryptocurrencies, transactions are send to Public Addresses which are derived from personally created private keys.

Since transactions could otherwise be traced by watching which addresses are sending to each-other, Monero uses a Diffie-hallman key exchange using the transaction information on the sender's side and the public address on the receivers end of a transaction to encrypt the recipients address on the ledger. To protect the sender, spending Monero is equivalent to forwarding the output of the previous transaction, so a users address is never stored on the ledger at all - this technique is called Stealth Addressing.

Since this solution is imperfect, and allows EABE attacks and is dependent on ECC for the key exchange, Monero uses a second layer of anonymity called Ring Signatures. When signing a transaction and broadcasting it to the network, Ring Signatures take signers from previous transactions and forge a new signature with Ring Size = N, where you cannot tell which entity in the group N actually authorized a transaction. This further obfuscated the blockchain and reduces the available attack vectors on the cryptocurrency as a whole, as well as introduces several zero knowledge proofs which prevent absolute analysis of the ledger.

Ring Signatures combined with Stealth Addressing prevent many attack vectors, but since new transactions are forwarded outputs from previous ones you can still perform analysis by viewing the amounts spent on-chain. To address this potential issue, a solution called RingCT was introduced which obfuscates the amount spent in a transaction.

Further attack vectors including cross-referencing an address posted in multiple places and IP leaks when connecting to the network are further developments sought out by the Monero community. These potential issues are addressed with Subaddresses and Kovri respectively.
