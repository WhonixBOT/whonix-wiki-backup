Monero GUI (graphical user interface) <u>and</u> Monero CLI (command line interface) is installed by default in {{Project name}}. The [https://gitlab.com/Whonix/monero-gui <code>monero-gui</code> package] is installed by default. No manual installation required. This goes for Monero programs, <code>monero-wallet-gui</code>, <code>monero-wallet-cli</code>, <code>monerod</code> and less frequently used utilities; see footnote. <ref>

Apart from these hints, installation and usage of Monero in {{project name}} does not differ from installing Monero on any Linux based distribution.

Advanced [[Qubes]] users could look into [https://getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/cli_wallet_daemon_isolation_qubes_whonix.html CLI Wallet/Daemon Isolation with Qubes + {{project_name}}] <ref>

</ref>

= Version Numbers =
The [https://gitlab.com/Whonix/monero-gui <code>monero-gui</code> package] is maintained <u>similar</u> to [[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates#Frozen_Packages|Debian stable frozen packages]]. <code>monero-gui</code> package updates will only include updates which are major releases or releases that fix security or network issues. <ref>
Such as fixes required if the Monero network is under denial of service (DOS) attacks.
</ref> This is to reduce the maintenance load of the package maintainer.

Should the user wish to use a newer version of Monero than available in the package, it is possible to [[#Uninstallation|uninstall the <code>monero-gui</code> package]]. (Uninstallation is optional if Monero is manually installed in home folder. <ref>
A manually installed Monero won't interfere with the <code>monero-gui</code> package. That is, unless the user installs Monero to folder <code>/usr/bin</code>. (Files in that folder would be replaced when the <code>monero-gui</code> package gets updated. However, the Monero start menu entry might be confusing since the start menu entry would start Monero from the <code>monero-gui</code> package (from  folder <code>/usr/bin</code>), and not the manually installed Monero.
</ref>) Since [[About#Based_on_Debian|{{project name}} is based on Debian]], the user can optionally install Monero using the usual instructions from the Monero website. Recommendations from the [[Install_Software|safely installing software]] wiki page such as [[Verifying Software Signatures]] applies.

= Monero Operations =

== Start Monero GUI ==
{{Open a product ws terminal}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
monero-wallet-gui
}}

For detailed instructions on how to use Monero, please refer to the [https://web.getmonero.org/get-started/using/ official Monero documentation].

== Start Monero CLI ==
Alternatively, you could also use Monero on the command line.

{{CodeSelect|code=
monero-wallet-cli
}}

== Remote Node Security and Privacy Considerations ==

Using a remote node provides a quick way to set up your Monero wallet. You will not have to download the entire blockchain.

It is important to note that the remote node:

* cannot spend your XMR (you hold the keys);
* does not know your IP address (we are connecting to it over Tor);
* does not know your XMR address; and
* does not know your balance or private view key.

However, using a remote node is not without risk. To learn more about the possible attacks, see: https://moneroworld.com/

In general, if the wallet warns you about the node misbehaving, then immediately exit the wallet and connect to a different node.

== Stream Isolation ==

}}

[[Stream Isolation]] for Monero has not yet been considered. Refer to the [[Stream Isolation]] page and search for <code>torsocks</code> <code>IsolatePID 1</code>.

To enforce stream isolation, you could experiment with the following commands.

{{CodeSelect|code=
DNS_PUBLIC=tcp TORSOCKS_ALLOW_INBOUND=1 torsocks ./monerod --p2p-bind-ip 127.0.0.1 --no-igd --hide-my-port
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
QMLSCENE_DEVICE=softwarecontext torsocks monero-wallet-gui
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
torsocks monero-wallet-cli
}}

= Uninstallation =
To avoid any issues with [[{{project_name_short}}_Debian_Packages|{{project_name_short}} meta package]] removal, first install the <code>dummy-dependency</code> package.

{{install Package
|package=dummy-dependency
}}

Remove the <code>monero-gui</code> package.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt purge monero-gui
}}

Done, removal of the <code>monero-gui</code> package is complete.

= Donations =
After installing Monero, please consider making a [[Donate|donation]] to {{project name}} to help keep it running for many years to come.

= See Also =
It is recommended to read the [[Money]] wiki page as it contains a lot of related information on how to make anonymous payments.

= Appendix =

== Monero Architecture ==

Monero works by having contributors host large files which are equivalent to a public ledger. Any time someone broadcasts a transaction, every ledger maintainer updates their copy of the ledger and ensures no cheating or fraud has occurred. As with most cryptocurrencies, transactions are sent to Public Addresses which are derived from personally created private keys.

Since transactions could otherwise be traced by watching which addresses are sending to each-other, Monero uses a Diffie-Hellman key exchange using the transaction information on the sender's side and the public address on the receiver's end of a transaction to encrypt the recipients address on the ledger. To protect the sender, spending Monero is equivalent to forwarding the output of the previous transaction, so a users address is never stored on the ledger at all - this technique is called Stealth Addressing.

Since this solution is imperfect, and allows EABE attacks and is dependent on ECC for the key exchange, Monero uses a second layer of anonymity called Ring Signatures. When signing a transaction and broadcasting it to the network, Ring Signatures take signers from previous transactions and forge a new signature with Ring Size = N, where you cannot tell which entity in the group N actually authorized a transaction. This further obfuscates the blockchain and reduces the available attack vectors on the cryptocurrency as a whole, as well as introduces several zero knowledge proofs which prevent absolute analysis of the ledger.

Ring Signatures combined with Stealth Addressing prevent many attack vectors, but since new transactions are forwarded outputs from previous ones you can still perform analysis by viewing the amounts spent on-chain. To address this potential issue, a solution called RingCT was introduced which obfuscates the amount spent in a transaction.

Further attack vectors including cross-referencing an address posted in multiple places and IP leaks when connecting to the network are further developments sought out by the Monero community. These potential issues are addressed with Subaddresses and Kovri respectively.
