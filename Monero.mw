}}

'''UNFINISHED'''

= Installation =
Apart from these hints, installing monero in Whonix does not differ from installing monero on any Linux based distribution.

Use Tor Browser, go to monero download page https://getmonero.org/downloads/ and download monero. <ref>
We avoid wget, since that does not enforce https.
</ref> <ref>
We avoid scurl, since there is no redirecting stable link. TODO: can probably be resolved by telling curl to follow redirects.
