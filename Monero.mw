= What is Monero? =
Monero is a private-centric cryptocurrency launched in 2014 to allow direct and anonymous digital payments without being dependent on a central authority.

Apart from these hints, installation and usage of Monero in {{project name}} does not differ from installing Monero on any Linux based distribution.

Advanced [[Qubes]] users could look into [https://getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/cli_wallet_daemon_isolation_qubes_whonix.html CLI Wallet/Daemon Isolation with Qubes + {{project_name}}] <ref>

Monero GUI (graphical user interface) <u>and</u> Monero CLI (command line interface) can be installed from {{Project name}} repository. <ref>

= Monero Operations =

== Start Monero GUI ==
Do not launch Monero from the start menu yet.

{{Open a product ws terminal}}

The requirement to set <code>QMLSCENE_DEVICE=softwarecontext</code> in the next line is a [https://github.com/monero-project/monero-gui/issues/2878 VM-specific Monero upstream bug].

{{CodeSelect|code=

}}

In the future, this will be simplified in {{project name}} <code>15.0.1.3.4</code> (and above) which is coming soon. <ref>
Workaround: https://github.com/Whonix/vm-config-dist/blob/master/etc/X11/Xsession.d/20software_rendering_in_vms
</ref> Also, users who upgrade will no longer require this workaround in the future.

== Start Monero CLI ==
Alternatively, you could also use Monero on the command line.

{{CodeSelect|code=
monero-wallet-cli
}}

== Remote Node Security and Privacy Considerations ==

Using a remote node provides a quick way to set up your Monero wallet. You will not have to download the entire blockchain.

It is important to note that the remote node:

* cannot spend your XMR (you hold the keys);
* does not know your IP address (we are connecting to it over Tor);
* does not know your XMR address; and
* does not know your balance or private view key.

However, using a remote node is not without risk. To learn more about the possible attacks, see: https://moneroworld.com/

In general, if the wallet warns you about the node misbehaving, then immediately exit the wallet and connect to a different node.

== Stream Isolation ==
{{mbox

| text  = Advanced users only!
}}

[[Stream Isolation]] for Monero has not yet been considered. Refer to the [[Stream Isolation]] page and search for <code>torsocks</code> <code>IsolatePID 1</code>.

To enforce stream isolation, you could experiment with the following commands.

{{CodeSelect|code=
DNS_PUBLIC=tcp TORSOCKS_ALLOW_INBOUND=1 torsocks ./monerod --p2p-bind-ip 127.0.0.1 --no-igd --hide-my-port
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
QMLSCENE_DEVICE=softwarecontext torsocks monero-wallet-gui
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
torsocks monero-wallet-cli
}}

It is recommended to read the [[Money]] wiki page as it contains a lot of related information on how to make anonymous payments.

= Credits =
Gratitude is expressed to the donors of Monero who funded the proposal [https://ccs.getmonero.org/proposals/adrelanos-debian-package.html Monero Debian Package Repository for 2 years], to [https://github.com/rehrar @rehrar] for helping the creator of the package (Whonix developer Patrick Schleizer) with writing the proposal, everyone else who supported the proposal, and the community of Monero developers and users at large for creating Monero.

= Appendix =

== Monero Architecture ==

Monero works by having contributors host large files which are equivalent to a public ledger. Any time someone broadcasts a transaction, every ledger maintainer updates their copy of the ledger and ensures no cheating or fraud has occurred. As with most cryptocurrencies, transactions are sent to Public Addresses which are derived from personally created private keys.

Since transactions could otherwise be traced by watching which addresses are sending to each-other, Monero uses a Diffie-Hellman key exchange using the transaction information on the sender's side and the public address on the receiver's end of a transaction to encrypt the recipients address on the ledger. To protect the sender, spending Monero is equivalent to forwarding the output of the previous transaction, so a users address is never stored on the ledger at all - this technique is called Stealth Addressing.

Since this solution is imperfect, and allows EABE attacks and is dependent on ECC for the key exchange, Monero uses a second layer of anonymity called Ring Signatures. When signing a transaction and broadcasting it to the network, Ring Signatures take signers from previous transactions and forge a new signature with Ring Size = N, where you cannot tell which entity in the group N actually authorized a transaction. This further obfuscates the blockchain and reduces the available attack vectors on the cryptocurrency as a whole, as well as introduces several zero knowledge proofs which prevent absolute analysis of the ledger.

Ring Signatures combined with Stealth Addressing prevent many attack vectors, but since new transactions are forwarded outputs from previous ones you can still perform analysis by viewing the amounts spent on-chain. To address this potential issue, a solution called RingCT was introduced which obfuscates the amount spent in a transaction.

Further attack vectors including cross-referencing an address posted in multiple places and IP leaks when connecting to the network are further developments sought out by the Monero community. These potential issues are addressed with Subaddresses and Kovri respectively.
