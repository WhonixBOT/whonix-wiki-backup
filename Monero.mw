'''UNFINISHED'''

= Installation =
Apart from these hints, installing monero in Whonix does not differ from installing monero on any Linux based distribution.

[[Update]] your package lists.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}

Install dependencies. <ref>
Package <code>qtbase5-dev</code> and the following packages are required if you want to use monero-gui.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install libpcsclite1 qtbase5-dev qt5-default qtdeclarative5-dev qml-module-qtquick-controls qml-module-qtquick-xmllistmodel qttools5-dev-tools qml-module-qtquick-dialogs
}}

Use Tor Browser, go to monero download page https://getmonero.org/downloads/ and download monero. <ref>
We avoid wget, since that does not enforce https.
</ref> <ref>
We avoid scurl, since there is no redirecting stable link. TODO: can probably be resolved by telling curl to follow redirects.
