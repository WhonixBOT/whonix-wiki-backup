{{security intro}}

{{project name}} can be downloaded over TLS (formerly SSL) and/or an onion service. Note that the [[SSL|TLS]] certificate authority (CA) system is seriously flawed and poses the risk of security breaches, therefore it should be avoided if possible.

As documented on the [[Verify the Whonix images|Verify Whonix Images]] page, OpenPGP verification is far safer and strongly recommended as an alternative to plain TLS.

The most secure method of obtaining {{project_name}} is to build it from source code. In this way, it is unnecessary to [[Trust|trust]] that developers have actually created [[Verifiable Builds|binaries which match the source code]]. For utmost security, the source code can be reviewed beforehand.

For further information, see: [[Comparison_with_Others#Download_Security|Anonymity Operating System Comparison: Download Security]].
