= Introduction =

This procedure is for advanced users who want the security benefit of separate {{gateway_product_name}} instances in {{q_project_name}}. While it affords some protection in the event other {{gateway_product_name}} instances are compromised, it will result in a different set of Tor entry guards unless precautions are taken.

Ensure the newly created <code>{{gateway_product_name_vm}}</code> is based on the <code>{{whonix-gw}}</code> Template and has a distinctive VM name, so it is not confused with other VMs. It is also recommended to <u>not</u> run multiple {{gateway_product_name}} in parallel, see [[Multiple {{gateway_product_name_short}}|Multiple {{gateway_product_name}}]].
