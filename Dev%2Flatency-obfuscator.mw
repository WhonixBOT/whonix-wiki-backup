= Latency-Obfuscator =

== Summary ==
This package is supposed to implement the mitigation discussed in https://phabricator.whonix.org/T530 using tc netem. Package WIP at https://github.com/HulaHoop0/latency-obfuscator

Packet latency (as observed by an adversary outside Tor) drops significantly when the CPU is stressed as can be observed in ICMP and TCP traffic. This is caused by c-state transitions. Non-solutions: Running a stress process with a high nice-level or disabling c-state because both solutions would heavily impact battery life and CPU temperature. 

The chosen solution is to add a random delay per packet to mask the this effect for best results.


== Implementation Details ==

* Use of /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d hooks to run the tc command whenever any NIC goes up: https://askubuntu.com/questions/1111652/network-manager-script-when-interface-up

* Interface names must be filtered to exclude <code>lo</code> <code>virbr*</code> devices or virtual environments and local daemons will incur a needless penalty.

* No need to react to "down" events because tc remains running in cases where the NIC goes down then up again. It declares "Error: Exclusivity flag on, cannot modify." in that situation when the command is re-run again.

* The limit parameter must be [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18792347/what-does-option-limit-in-tc-netem-mean-and-do raised] from the default of 1000 or else packets get dropped as traffic demand increases. 12500 covers connection speeds of up to 1Gbps.

* <code>sudo tc qdisc</code> indicates all the default queues setup for interfaces on Linux

* Info on various qdisc filter properties: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/advanced_traffic_control

== Relevant Commands and Testing ==

* Setup a VPN connection in Whonix WS then run ping <foo>.com

* Simulate CPU load  with stress <code>ctrl + c</code> to stop:
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt install stress
stress -c 4
}}
You will notice latency markedly dropping and staying there.

* Run this command for mitigation. It will mask the latency patterns induced by the <code>stress</code> command:
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo tc qdisc add dev eth0 root netem limit 12500 slot 75ms 200ms packets 1
}}
