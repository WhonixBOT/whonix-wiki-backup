= Introduction =

[https://electrum.org/ Electrum] is a popular Bitcoin wallet. According to the [https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#how-does-electrum-work Electrum FAQ]:

<blockquote>
<b>How does Electrum work?</b>

Electrum’s focus is speed, with low resource usage and simplifying Bitcoin. Startup times are instant because it operates in conjunction with high-performance servers that handle the most complicated parts of the Bitcoin system.

<b>Does Electrum trust servers?</b>

In short, not really. The Electrum client never sends private keys to the servers. In addition, it verifies the information reported by servers, using a technique called [https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/spv.html#spv Simple Payment Verification].</blockquote>

The non-official thin client Electrum appears to be well-designed. It does not need to download/verify the blockchain and users store their private keys locally, which eliminates the need to trust third-party severs. This is an advantage over some other Bitcoin wallets which are affected by this: if the third-party server were ever compromised, all of the users' bitcoins could be stolen. There is also the possibility that the third-party could lose a user's private keys or walk away with them.

Quote [https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#does-electrum-trust-servers Does Electrum trust servers?]:

<blockquote>[...]

One of the servers, arbitrarily, is selected as the “main” server.

* The client subscribes to its own addresses (nit: sha256 hashes of scriptPubKeys) so that it would be notified of new transactions touching them. It also synchronizes the existing history of its addresses. This means the client sacrifices some privacy to the server, as the server can now reasonably guess that all these addresses belong to the same entity.
* As above, confirmed transactions are verified via SPV.
* The server is trusted about unconfirmed transactions.
* The server can lie by omission. That is, it can “forget” to mention (both confirmed and unconfirmed) transactions that are relevant to the client.
* The main server is also used for fee estimates, and is trusted with those (low-high sanity limits are applied in the client)
* The main server is also used to broadcast the transactions the client makes.

= Version Numbers =
The [https://gitlab.com/Whonix/binaries-freedom <code>binaries-freedom</code> package] is maintained <u>similar</u> to [[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates#Frozen_Packages|Debian stable frozen packages]]. <code>binaries-freedom</code> package updates will only include updates which are major releases or releases that fix security or network issues. This is to reduce the maintenance load of the package maintainer.

Should the user wish to use a newer version of Electrum than available in the package, it is possible to [[#Uninstallation|uninstall the <code>binaries-freedom</code> package]]. (Uninstallation is optional if Electrum is manually installed in home folder. <ref>
A manually installed Electrum won't interfere with the <code>binaries-freedom</code> package. That is, unless the user installs Electrum to folder <code>/usr/bin</code>. (Files in that folder would be replaced when the <code>binaries-freedom</code> package gets updated. However, the Electrum start menu entry might be confusing since the start menu entry would start Electrum from the <code>binaries-freedom</code> package (from  folder <code>/usr/bin</code>), and not the manually installed Electrum.
</ref>) Since [[About#Based_on_Debian|{{project name}} is based on Debian]], the user can optionally install Electrum using the usual instructions from the Electrum website. Recommendations from the [[Install_Software|safely installing software]] wiki page such as [[Verifying Software Signatures]] applies. See also [[Install_Software#Install_Newer_Software_Versions|Install Newer Software Versions]].

[[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]] users are recommended to configure a [https://qubes-os.org//doc/split-bitcoin/ Split Bitcoin Wallet] to better protect their private keys. To protect against identity correlation through Tor circuit sharing, follow the instructions below (see [[Stream_Isolation|Stream Isolation]] for more information).

'''1.''' Configure a manual server connection.

When Electrum is started for the first time, users are met with the prompt: <code>"How do you want to connect to a server?"</code>. 

Choose <code>Select server manually</code> and press <code>Next</code>.

'''2.''' Change the proxy settings. This is useful for [[Stream Isolation]].

The necessary settings are:

* Proxy: <code>SOCKS5</code>
* Host: <code>10.152.152.10</code>
* Port: <code>9111</code>

Press <code>Next</code> and the application should be fully functional.
