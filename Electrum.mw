[https://electrum.org/ Electrum] is a popular Bitcoin wallet. The non-official thin client Electrum appears to be well-designed. It does not need to download/verify the blockchain and users store their private keys locally, which eliminates the need to trust third-party severs. <ref>Some Bitcoin wallets other than Electrum are affected by this: if the third-party sever was ever compromised, all of the users' bitcoins could be stolen. There is also the possibility that the third-party could lose a user's private keys or walk away with them.</ref>
__FORCETOC__
= Install Electrum =
Note:  In order to mitigate the risk from a known exploit, Electrum versions older than 3.3 are prevented from connecting to public servers. This was done to prevent users from being exposed to phishing messages. If your currently installed Elecrtum version is older than 3.3 you will need to download the latest Electrum version.


Although it is strongly recommended that users install software from the Debian repositories, the latest version available from Debian is an older electrum-3.2.3-1 version which will not connect to public servers. This means APT, Debian's official package manager can not be used to install a usable version. Currently users must install Electrum from the official electrum website. While the following instruction provide steps to verify the AppImage, users should understand the risks involved with manual software installation and make every effort to follow Best Practices when installing software.

[ref]
Installing software best practices: 

Prefer APT - Generally, the safest option is to stick with Debian's official package manager APT.
Avoid Third Party Package Managers - There are many third party package managers besides APT, however they lack the security safeguards that are standard in Debian. 
Avoid Manual Software Installation - Generally avoid the manual installation of packages, even trusted ones.
Always Verify Signatures - For greater system security, it is strongly recommended to avoid installing unsigned software.
Prefer Packages from Debian Stable Repository - Users who decide to install new software after considering the risks should preference Debian's stable repository, rather than the testing / unstable or third party repositories.

Note: Unless directed otherwise, the following instructions are run in Whonix-Workstation anon-whonix (Qubes-Whonix).

1. Import the gpg public key of Electrum developer Thomas Voegtlin.

gpg --recv-keys 6694D8DE7BE8EE5631BED9502BD5824B7F9470E6

When finished, the output should appear similar to the following screenshot. 

electrum_import_gpg_key.png

2. Verify the public key fingerprint.

gpg --fingerprint 6694D8DE7BE8EE5631BED9502BD5824B7F9470E6

At the time of writing, the output will appear like the following screenshot. 

electrum_verify_gpg_fingerprint.png

3. Download the Electrum AppImage.

Note: At the time of writing, elecrtum-3.3.4 was the latest stable release. Before starting the Electrum download, users should browse to https://electrum.org/#download electrum.org/#download to verify the correct file download. Then download the file with scurl.

To find the correct image download: "Right-click" AppImage -> "Select" Copy Link Location -> Append to scurl command.

scurl-download https://download.electrum.org/3.3.4/electrum-3.3.4-x86_64.AppImage

4.Download the corresponding gpg signature which will be used to verify the integrity of the AppImage.

Note: If users downloaded a later Electrum version in step 3 the corresponding signature file must also be downloaded.

To find the correct signature file download: "Right-click" signature -> "Select" Copy Link Location -> "Append" to scurl command.

scurl-download https://download.electrum.org/3.3.4/electrum-3.3.4-x86_64.AppImage.asc

5. Verify the integrity of the AppImage image.

Note: This must be done from the same directory that you downloaded the AppImage and signature.

gpg --verify electrum-3.3.4-x86_64.AppImage.asc

When image has been verified the output should show a "Good signature" similar to the screenshot below. 

electrum_gpg_good_signature.png

The above "gpg: WARNING" can be ignored since it does not alter the validity of the signature related to the downloaded key. Rather, this warning refers to the level of trust placed in the developers signing key and the web of trust. To remove this warning, the developers signing key must be personally signed with your own key.

If the following "gpg: BAD signature" message appears, the Appimage has been corrupted or altered during the download process.

In this event, delete both the Appimage and signature and either wait 10-15 minutes for the Tor circuits to change, or open up the Arm Tor Controller in Whonix-Gateway (Qubes-Whonix: sys-whonix) and type "n" to create new Tor circuits. Wait for a random period of time before repeating the steps to download the AppImage and signature.

6. Change file permissions.

chmod +x electrum-3.3.4-x86_64.AppImage

== Starting Electrum ==

Please refer to the official Documentation at [http://docs.electrum.org docs.electrum.org] for comprehensive instructions, as well as more advanced topics like Cold Storage of private keys.

To start Electrum (all platforms):

cd /path/to/AppImage

./electrum-3.3.4-x86_64.AppImage

[[Qubes-Whonix]] users are recommended to configure a [https://qubes-os.org//doc/split-bitcoin/ Split Bitcoin Wallet] to better protect their private keys. To protect against identity correlation through Tor circuit sharing, follow the instructions below (see: [[Stream_Isolation|Stream Isolation]] for more information).

== Electrum: First Run ==
'''Enabling [[Stream Isolation]] on the Electrum application'''


'''1.''' Manual server selection:

When Electrum is started for the first time, users are met with the prompt: <code>"How do you want to connect to a server"</code>. 

Choose <code>Select server manually</code> and press <code>Next</code>.

''(Image: Connect to Server)''

[[Image:Electrum_select_server_manually.png]]

'''2.''' Change the Proxy settings:

The necessary settings are <code>SOCKS5</code> with host <code>10.152.152.10</code> and port: <code>9111</code>. 

Press <code>Next</code> and the application should be fully functional.

'''Note:''' If Electrum is already set up but stream isolation was not enabled, then navigate to <code>Tools</code> -> <code>Network</code> in Electrum to bring up the server and proxy settings.
