[https://electrum.org/ Electrum] is a popular Bitcoin wallet. The non-official thin client Electrum appears to be well designed. It does not need to download/verify the blockchain and users store their private keys locally, which eliminates the need to trust third-party severs. <ref>Some Bitcoin wallets other than Electrum are affected by this: If the third-party sever was ever compromised, all of the users' bitcoins could be stolen. There is also the possibility that the third-party could lose a user's private keys or walk away with them.</ref>
