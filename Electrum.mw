[https://electrum.org/ electrum] is a popular Bitcoin wallet. The nonofficial thin client electrum appears to be well designed. It does not need to download/verify the blockchain and does not trust third-party servers with your private keys.

Install Electrum.

[[Install Software#Install from Debian testing|install from Debian testing]]! <-- READ!

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get -t buster install electrum
}}

Electrum can now be found in the KDE Applications Menu under the "Internet" category. 

For usage instructions of Electrum or more advanced topics like Cold Storage of your private keys, please refer to the official Documentation at [http://docs.electrum.org docs.electrum.org].

Create a wallet with a strong password!

Optional but recommended for better [[Stream Isolation]].

After wallet creation is complete and Electrum asks you "How do you want to connect to a server", choose "Select server manually" and press <Next>. 

Now re-enable the "Select server automatically" check-box and change the Proxy setting to SOCKS5 with host: 10.152.152.10 and port: 9111. Press <Next> and you should be good to go. 

If you already have Electrum set up but forgot to enable Stream Isolation, you can always go to Tools -> Network in Electrum to bring up the server and proxy settings.
