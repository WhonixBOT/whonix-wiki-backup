}}
[https://electrum.org/ Electrum] is a popular Bitcoin wallet. The non-official thin client Electrum appears to be well-designed. It does not need to download/verify the blockchain and users store their private keys locally, which eliminates the need to trust third-party severs. <ref>Some Bitcoin wallets other than Electrum are affected by this: if the third-party server was ever compromised, all of the users' bitcoins could be stolen. There is also the possibility that the third-party could lose a user's private keys or walk away with them.</ref>

While it is [[Install_Software#Best_Practices|strongly recommended]] to install software from the Debian repositories, the [https://packages.debian.org/sid/utils/electrum latest available package] is too old and will not connect to public servers. This means Debian's official package manager (<code>APT</code>) cannot be used to install a functional Electrum version. 

The best option at present is to install Electrum from the official website. The following instructions provide steps to verify the AppImage, but keep in mind the risks involved with manual software installation. Always make every effort to follow [[Install_Software#Best_Practices|Best Practices]] when installing software.

Installing software best practices: 

* [[Install_Software#Prefer_APT|Prefer APT]] - Generally, the safest option is to stick with Debian's official package manager APT.
* [[Install_Software#Avoid_Third_Party_Package_Managers| Avoid Third Party Package Managers]] - There are many third party package managers besides APT, however they lack the security safeguards that are standard in Debian. 
* [[Install_Software#Avoid_Manual_Software_Installation| Avoid Manual Software Installation]] - Generally avoid the manual installation of packages, even trusted ones.
* [[Install_Software#Always_Verify_Signatures| Always Verify Signatures]] - For greater system security, it is strongly recommended to avoid installing unsigned software.
* [[Install_Software#Prefer_Packages_from_Debian_Stable_Repository| Prefer Packages from Debian Stable Repository]] - Users who decide to install new software after considering the risks should preference Debian's stable repository, rather than the testing / unstable or third party repositories.

== Installation Steps ==
{{Box|text=
'''Note:''' The following instructions should be applied in Whonix-Workstation ([[Qubes-Whonix]]: <code>anon-whonix</code>).

'''1.''' {{Open a Whonix-Workstation Terminal}}

'''2.''' Import the gpg public key of Electrum developer Thomas Voegtlin.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --recv-keys 6694D8DE7BE8EE5631BED9502BD5824B7F9470E6
}}

When finished, the output should be similar to the following image. 

'''Figure:''' ''gpg Key Importation''

[[Image:electrum_import_gpg_key.png]]

'''3.''' Verify the public key fingerprint.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --fingerprint 6694D8DE7BE8EE5631BED9502BD5824B7F9470E6
}}

In early-2019, the output is identical to the following image.

'''Figure:''' ''Fingerprint Verification''

[[Image:electrum_verify_gpg_fingerprint.png]]

'''4.''' Download the Electrum AppImage.

<u>Note:</u> At the time of writing, <code>elecrtum-3.3.4</code> was the latest stable release. Before starting the Electrum download, browse to [https://electrum.org/#download electrum.org/#download] to verify the correct file path. Then download the file with [[Secure_Downloads#Downloads_with_scurl_-_SSL_Command_Line_Downloader|scurl]]. <ref>To find the correct image download: <i><code>"Right-click"</code></i> <code>AppImage</code> -> <i><code>"Select"</i> Copy Link Location</code> -> <i><code>Append</i> to scurl command</code>.</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
scurl-download https://download.electrum.org/3.3.4/electrum-3.3.4-x86_64.AppImage
}}

'''5.''' Download the corresponding gpg signature.

It is necessary to verify the integrity of the AppImage with the correct signature.

<u>Note:</u> If users downloaded a later Electrum version at <i>step 4</i>, then modify the following command to match the corresponding signature file. <ref>To find the correct signature file download: <i><code>"Right-click"</i> signature</code> -> <i><code>"Select"</i> Copy Link Location</code> -> <i><code>"Append"</i> to scurl command</code></ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
scurl-download https://download.electrum.org/3.3.4/electrum-3.3.4-x86_64.AppImage.asc
}}
 
'''6.''' Verify the integrity of the AppImage image.

<u>Note:</u> This command must be run in the same directory as the downloaded AppImage and signature.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --verify electrum-3.3.4-x86_64.AppImage.asc
}}

If the image is verified successfully, the output will show a "Good signature" similar to the screenshot below. 

'''Figure:''' ''Good Signature''

[[Image:electrum_gpg_good_signature.png]]

The above "gpg: WARNING" can be ignored since it does not alter the validity of the signature related to the downloaded key. Rather, this warning refers to the level of trust placed in the developers signing key and the web of trust. To remove this warning, the developers signing key must be personally signed with your own key.

If the following "gpg: BAD signature" message appears, the Appimage has been corrupted or altered during the download process.

'''Figure:''' ''Bad Signature''

[[Image:Electrum_bad_gpg_signature.png]]

In this event, delete both the AppImage and signature and either wait 10-15 minutes for the Tor circuits to change, or open up the [[Arm]] Tor Controller in Whonix-Gateway ([[Qubes-Whonix]]: <code>sys-whonix</code>) and type "n" to create new Tor circuits. Wait for a random period of time before repeating the steps to download the AppImage and signature.

'''7.''' Change file permissions.

Make the electrum AppImage executable.

{{CodeSelect|code=
chmod +x electrum-3.3.4-x86_64.AppImage
}}
}}

Please refer to the official Documentation at [http://docs.electrum.org docs.electrum.org] for comprehensive instructions, as well as more advanced topics like [http://docs.electrum.org/en/latest/coldstorage.html Cold Storage] of private keys.

To start Electrum on all platforms, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
./electrum-3.3.4-x86_64.AppImage
}}

[[Qubes-Whonix]] users are recommended to configure a [https://qubes-os.org//doc/split-bitcoin/ Split Bitcoin Wallet] to better protect their private keys. To protect against identity correlation through Tor circuit sharing, follow the instructions below (see [[Stream_Isolation|Stream Isolation]] for more information).

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = These steps enable [[Stream Isolation|stream isolation]] for the Electrum application]].
}}


'''1.''' Configure a manual server connection.

When Electrum is started for the first time, users are met with the prompt: <code>"How do you want to connect to a server"</code>. 

Choose <code>Select server manually</code> and press <code>Next</code>.

'''Figure:''' ''Server Setting''

[[Image:Electrum_select_server_manually.png]]

'''2.''' Change the proxy settings.

The necessary settings are <code>SOCKS5</code> with host <code>10.152.152.10</code> and port: <code>9111</code>. 

Press <code>Next</code> and the application should be fully functional.

'''Figure:''' ''SOCKS5 Proxy Configuration''

'''Note:''' If Electrum is already set up but stream isolation was not enabled, then navigate to <code>Tools</code> -> <code>Network</code> in Electrum to bring up the server and proxy settings.
