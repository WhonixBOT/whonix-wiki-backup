[https://electrum.org/ Electrum] is a popular Bitcoin wallet. The non-official thin client Electrum appears to be well-designed. It does not need to download/verify the blockchain and users store their private keys locally, which eliminates the need to trust third-party severs. <ref>Some Bitcoin wallets other than Electrum are affected by this: if the third-party sever was ever compromised, all of the users' bitcoins could be stolen. There is also the possibility that the third-party could lose a user's private keys or walk away with them.</ref>
__FORCETOC__
== Install Electrum ==
Unfortunately the <code>electrum</code> version in Debian <code>{{Stable_Whonix_based_on_Debian_codename}}</code> does not work (Whonix {{VersionShort}} [[About#Based_on_Debian|is based]] on Debian <code>{{Stable_Whonix_based_on_Debian_codename}}</code>). Therefore, the next best option is installing <code>electrum</code> from Debian <code>stretch-backports</code>.

{{Install Backport|
package=electrum
}}

== Starting Electrum ==

Please refer to the official Documentation at [http://docs.electrum.org docs.electrum.org] for comprehensive instructions, as well as more advanced topics like Cold Storage of private keys.

To start Electrum:
* in [[Non-Qubes-Whonix]]: <code>Applications Menu</code> > <code>Internet</code> > <code>Electrum</code>
* in [[Qubes-Whonix]]: <code>Qubes applications menu</code> > <code>AppVM</code> > <code>Electrum</code>  

[[Qubes-Whonix]] users are recommended to configure a [https://qubes-os.org//doc/split-bitcoin/ Split Bitcoin Wallet] to better protect their private keys. To protect against identity correlation through Tor circuit sharing, follow the instructions below (see: [[Stream_Isolation|Stream Isolation]] for more information).

== Electrum: First Run ==
'''Enabling [[Stream Isolation]] on the Electrum application'''


'''1.''' Manual server selection:

When Electrum is started for the first time, users are met with the prompt: <code>"How do you want to connect to a server"</code>. 

Choose <code>Select server manually</code> and press <code>Next</code>.

'''2.''' Change the Proxy settings:

The necessary settings are <code>SOCKS5</code> with host <code>10.152.152.10</code> and port: <code>9111</code>. 

Press <code>Next</code> and the application should be fully functional.

'''Note:''' If Electrum is already set up but stream isolation was not enabled, then navigate to <code>Tools</code> -> <code>Network</code> in Electrum to bring up the server and proxy settings.
