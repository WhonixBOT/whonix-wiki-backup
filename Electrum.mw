[https://electrum.org/ Electrum] is a popular Bitcoin wallet. The non-official thin client Electrum appears to be well-designed. It does not need to download/verify the blockchain and users store their private keys locally, which eliminates the need to trust third-party severs. <ref>Some Bitcoin wallets other than Electrum are affected by this: If the third-party sever was ever compromised, all of the users' bitcoins could be stolen. There is also the possibility that the third-party could lose a user's private keys or walk away with them.</ref>

To start Electrum:
* [[Non-Qubes-Whonix]]: <code>KDE Applications Menu</code> -> <code>Internet</code> -> <code>Electrum</code>
* [[Qubes-Whonix]]: <code>Qubes applications menu</code> -> <code>AppVM</code> -> <code>Electrum</code>  

[[Qubes-Whonix]] users are recommended to configure a [https://qubes-os.org//doc/split-bitcoin/ Split Bitcoin Wallet] to better protect their private keys. To protect against identity correlation through Tor circuit sharing, follow the instructions below (see: [[Stream_Isolation|Stream Isolation]]).

== Electrum: First Run ==

'''1.''' Manual server selection.

When Electrum is started for the first time, users are met with the prompt: <i>"How do you want to connect to a server"</i>.  Choose <i>"Select server manually"</i> and press <i><Next></i>.

'''3.''' Change the Proxy settings.

The necessary settings are <code>SOCKS5</code> with host <code>10.152.152.10</code> and port: <code>9111</code>. Press <i><Next></i> and the application should be fully functional.
