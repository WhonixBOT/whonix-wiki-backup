= Introduction =

[https://electrum.org/ Electrum] is a popular Bitcoin wallet. According to the [https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#how-does-electrum-work Electrum FAQ]:

<blockquote>
<b>How does Electrum work?</b>

Electrum’s focus is speed, with low resource usage and simplifying Bitcoin. Startup times are instant because it operates in conjunction with high-performance servers that handle the most complicated parts of the Bitcoin system.

<b>Does Electrum trust servers?</b>

In short, not really. The Electrum client never sends private keys to the servers. In addition, it verifies the information reported by servers, using a technique called [https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/spv.html#spv Simple Payment Verification].</blockquote>

The non-official thin client Electrum appears to be well-designed. It does not need to download/verify the blockchain and users store their private keys locally, which eliminates the need to trust third-party severs. This is an advantage over some other Bitcoin wallets which are affected by this: if the third-party server were ever compromised, all of the users' bitcoins could be stolen. There is also the possibility that the third-party could lose a user's private keys or walk away with them.
