[https://electrum.org/ electrum] is a popular Bitcoin wallet. The non-official thin client Electrum appears to be well designed. It does not need to download/verify the blockchain and users store their private keys locally which eliminates the need to trust third-party severs.<ref> If the third-party sever was compromised all of the users bitcoin could be stolen. There is also the possibility that the third-party could lose your private keys or walking away with them.</ref>
