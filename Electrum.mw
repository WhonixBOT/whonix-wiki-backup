}}

[https://electrum.org/ electrum] is a popular Bitcoin wallet. The non-official thin client electrum appears to be well designed. It does not need to download/verify the blockchain and users store their private keys locally which eliminates the need to trust third-party severs. If the third-party sever was compromised all of the users bitcoin could be stolen. There is also the possibility that the third-party could lose your private keys or walking away with them.

Prior to installing Electrum read Install software from Debian testing to understand the risks involved with mixing packages from Debian stable with packages from a later releases such as Debian testing.It is recommended that users create a separate Whonix-Workstation to install Electrum due to the risks posed by mixing packages.

Install Electrum

1. In Whonix-Workstation konsole, add Debian stable codename "stretch" to the Apt-conf default-release. 

sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/70defaultrelease

Add the following text.

APT::Default-Release "stretch";

Save and exit.

2. Add the current Debian testing codename "buster" to sources.list.

sudo su -c "echo -e 'deb http://http.debian.net/debian buster main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/testing.list"

Or alternatively use the .onion mirror. 

sudo su -c "echo -e 'deb tor+http://vwakviie2ienjx6t.onion/debian buster main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/testing.list"

3. Update the package lists.

sudo apt-get update

4. In Whonix-Workstation konsole, install Electrum.

sudo apt-get install electrum/buster

Starting Electrum

To find usage instructions for Electrum and more advanced topics such as Cold Storage of your private keys, please refer to the official Documentation at docs.electrum.org.

(Non-Qubes-Whonix)

KDE Applications Menu -> Internet-> Electrum

(Qubes-Whonix)

Qubes applications menu -> AppVM -> Electrum  

It is recommended that Qubes-Whonix users set up a Split Bitcoin Wallet to better protect their private keys.

Users should create a wallet with a Strong Password!

Optional but recommended for better [[Stream Isolation]].

1. When starting Electrum for the first time, users are prompted with the question "How do you want to connect to a server".  Choose "Select server manually" -> press <Next>.

2. Re-enable "Select server automatically".

3. Change the Proxy setting to SOCKS5 with host: 10.152.152.10 and port: 9111. Press <Next> and you should be good to go.

Note: If you already have Electrum set up but forgot to enable Stream Isolation, you can always go to Tools -> Network in Electrum to bring up the server and proxy settings.
