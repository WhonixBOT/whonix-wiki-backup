"internal eroror" doesnt work anymore

The {{project name}} Wiki has a PdfBook extension installed.<ref>PdfBook supports creating an offline file of all pages under a specific category.</ref> <ref>[https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:PdfBook#Usage PdfBook help].</ref> <ref>The following syntax was successfully used (replaced "foo(.bar)" with the actual URL): http://www.foo.bar/wiki/index.php?title=Category:foo&action=pdfbook</ref> This enables users to create a non-polished collection of all {{project name}} documentation.  

To generate a PDF, follow this link:

https://www.whonix.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Documentation&action=pdfbook

At the time of writing, a 16.6MB file is created. The result is readable but needs some cleanup. Translated pages are included, but will sometimes present with broken, nonsensical characters. The links are absolute and not relative, meaning users are redirected to the online site instead of internal chapters in the file. To avoid this, use the search function instead.
