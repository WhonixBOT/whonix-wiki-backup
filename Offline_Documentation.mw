The Whonix Wiki has a PdfBook extension installed.<ref>PdfBook supports creating an offline file of all pages under a category</ref><ref>[https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:PdfBook#Usage PdfBook help]</ref><ref>Example I followed: http://www.foo.bar/wiki/index.php?title=Category:foo&action=pdfbook</ref> This allows for creating a non-polished collection of all our documentation.  

Go to this link to generate the PDF:

https://www.whonix.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Documentation&action=pdfbook


At the time of writing, it gives a 16.6MB sized file. The result is readable but needs some cleanup. Translated pages are included sometimes in broken gibberish characters. Links are absolute and not relative which means they will redirect you to the online site instead of internal chapters in the file so use the search function instead.
