= Introduction =
corridor is a Tor traffic whitelisting gateway. It is a filtering gateway. Not a proxying gateway.

It can also be used as a [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/BridgeFirewall BridgeFirewall].

'''UNFINISHED'''

Testers only!

It is possible to configure Whonix-Gateway (sys-whonix) to use corridor as <u>local</u> proxy to establish the following tunnel:<br />
'''User -> corridor -> Tor -> Internet'''

This is not necessarily more anonymous. It is an additional fail-save Tor traffic whitelisting firewall that would protect from accidental clearnet leaks (hypothetical clearnet leak bugs in Whonix). As [https://github.com/rustybird/corridor corridor's project description] states, quote "it cannot prevent malware on a client computer from finding out your clearnet IP address". corridor is mostly useful for developers and auditors of Whonix, perhaps also for advanced users who would like to have an additional safety net.

It does not increase the tunnel length, i.e. it does not add more relays between you and the destination, if you are interested in that, see [[Tunnels/Introduction]].

If you want to do this, apply the following instructions.

[[Qubes-Whonix]] only! [[Non-Qubes-Whonix]] is [[unsupported]].
