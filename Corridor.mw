= Introduction =
[https://github.com/rustybird/corridor corridor] is a Tor traffic whitelisting gateway. It is a filtering gateway, not a proxying gateway and can also be configured as a [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/BridgeFirewall BridgeFirewall].

It is possible to configure Whonix-Gateway (<code>sys-whonix</code>) to use corridor as <u>local</u> proxy to establish the following tunnel:<br />
<code>User</code> -> <code>corridor</code> -> <code>Tor</code> > <code>Internet</code>

This is not necessarily more anonymous, but it does provide an additional fail-safe -- a Tor traffic whitelisting firewall that helps protect against accidental clearnet leaks (hypothetical clearnet leak bugs in Whonix). As [https://github.com/rustybird/corridor corridor's project description] states: "... it cannot prevent malware on a client computer from finding out your clearnet IP address." 

corridor is mostly useful for developers and auditors of Whonix, along with advanced users who would like to have an additional safety net. Note that it cannot protect from hypothetical bugs affecting Qubes' ProxyVM; a [https://github.com/rustybird/corridor physically-isolated, standalone corridor-Gateway] is necessary to cover that leak vector.

corridor does not increase the tunnel length, meaning no more relays are added between a user and the destination. Users interested in this configuration should read [[Tunnels/Introduction]].

== Warning ==

By default, the following instructions will result in:

# The [https://packages.debian.org/jessie/tor Debian tor package] being installed.
# Thereby automatically connecting to the [https://www.torproject.org Tor] public network.
# Downloading of corridor from [[Whonix-APT-Repository]].
}}


This behavior might be dangerous if users need / want to [[Hide_Tor_and_Whonix_from_your_ISP|hide Tor and Whonix from the ISP]]. 

If Whonix is already in use, then configuring a second running instance of [[Tor]] will ensure that it is independent of the one running inside Whonix-Gateway (<code>sys-whonix</code>). From the ISP's perspective, the user will have a different network [[Fingerprint]]. The anonymity impact should be no worse than running Tor Browser, or system-tor and Whonix at the same time.

== dom0 Setup ==
Create a new standalone ProxyVM called {{Code2|sys-corridor}} based on the Debian-9 template.

<code>Qubes VM Manager</code> -> <code>Create AppVM</code> -> <code>enable 'Standalone'</code> -> <code>name: {{Code2|sys-corridor}}</code> -> <code>template: debian-9</code> -> <code>OK</code>

Enable the {{Code2|corridor}} qvm service.

<code>Qubes VM Manager</code> -> <code>click on {{Code2|sys-corridor}}</code> -> <code>right-click</code> -> <code>VM settings</code> -> <code>services</code> -> <code>type in the field</code> -> <code>{{Code2|corridor}}</code> -> <code>press {{Code2|+}}</code> -> <code>press OK</code>

== sys-corridor Setup ==

If a BridgeFirewall is required, [[#Optional:_BridgeFirewall_corridor_Configuration|first configure Tor to use bridges]] before installing corridor. All the following steps should be applied in [https://www.qubes-os.org Qubes'] [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/templates/debian/ Debian template].

=== Install corridor ===

Start <code>sys-corridor</code> and open a terminal using Qubes start menu.

{{Whonix-APT-Repository-Add}}

{{Update}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}

Install corridor.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install corridor
}}

While these instructions remain experimental, you are advised to run the following systemctl commands to check if everything is functioning correctly.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl --no-pager status corridor-data
sudo systemctl --no-pager status corridor-init-forwarding 
sudo systemctl --no-pager status corridor-init-logged 
sudo systemctl --no-pager status corridor-init-snat
}}

Reboot {{Code2|sys-corridor}}.

=== Optional: BridgeFirewall corridor Configuration ===  

{{mbox
| type      = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text       = "Bridges are less reliable and tend to have lower performance than other entry points. If you live in a uncensored area, they are not necessarily more secure than entry guards." <ref>[https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-May/024378.html bridge vs non-bridge users anonymity].</ref>
}}


In order to use corridor as a [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/BridgeFirewall BridgeFirewall], configure Tor to use [https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges.html.en bridges] before installing corridor. <ref>The Whonix [[Bridges]] page can help, but the steps do not apply one-to-one.</ref> 

'''1.''' Start <code>sys-corridor</code> and open a terminal using Qubes start menu.<br />
'''2.''' Create folder {{Code2|/etc/corridor.d}} and configuration file {{Code2|/etc/corridor.d/21-bridges-user.conf}} first. <ref>This skip is stepped if [https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#EntryGuards Tor entry guards] are preferred.</ref> <br />
'''3.''' Create a bridges configuration file.

{{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/corridor.d/21-bridges-user.conf
}}

'''4.''' Add the following text. (Syntax: like torrc)

TODO: This step is currently untested.

{{CodeSelect|code=
BRIDGES="\
Bridge 1.2.3.4:443
Bridge 2.3.4.5:443
"
}}

Save.

== Test corridor ==

=== Test Preparation ===

'''1.''' Run the [[#Install_corridor|above systemctl commands]] again. <br />
'''2.''' Create, or use an appropriate existing AppVM named <code>corridor-client</code> (or similar).<br />
'''3.''' Install / run either system-tor (from Debian or Fedora package sources) or Tor Browser.<br />
'''4.''' Set the NetVM of <code>corridor-client</code> to <code>sys-corridor</code>. Tor should be still able to connect.

=== Testing Steps ===

To test system-tor, start watching Tor's log.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo tail -f /var/log/tor/log
}}

Check if it made an initial, successful connection.

Then restart Tor.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo service tor restart
}}

Check if Tor is still able to connect.

To test Tor Browser:

'''1.''' First check Tor Browser can make an initial connection to the Internet while the NetVM is still set to <code>sys-firewall</code>.<br />
'''2.''' Next, set the NetVM to <code>sys-corridor</code> and confirm it is still able to connect. If so, that is a positive sign.<br />
'''3.''' Finally, attempt an untorified connection by using an application like Chromium or Firefox browser. Untorified applications should fail to connect to the Internet.

== Test Logging ==
Whenever a user attempts an action that is blocked by corridor, like the [[#Test_corridor|above tests]], it will appear in syslog. To inspect {{Code2|/var/log/syslog}}.

{{Open File|filename=
/var/log/syslog
}}

To check that run inside <code>sys-corridor</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog
}}

If corridor blocks anything, the output will be similar to this.

{{CodeSelect|code=
Jul 19 00:58:27 localhost kernel: [  954.706833] corridor:
}}

== Interpreting the Results ==
The safest configuration is only setting <code>sys-whonix</code> to use <code>sys-corridor</code> as a NetVM. The reason is the [https://github.com/marmarek/qubes-core-agent-linux/blob/master/vm-systemd/qubes-update-check.service qubes-update-check.service] will try to use the Internet without Tor, and [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/1814 other programs] may also try to use clearnet. Therefore, always shut down <code>corridor-client</code>.

== Configure sys-whonix ==
Set the NetVM of <code>sys-whonix</code> to <code>sys-corridor</code>.

<code>Qubes VM Manager</code> -> <code>one left-click on sys-whonix</code> -> <code>right-click</code> -> <code>VM-Settings</code> -> <code>NetVM</code> -> <code>{{Code2|sys-corridor}}</code> -> <code>OK</code>

The procedure is now complete.

= Debugging =
If problems are encountered, this section provides tips on gathering useful information for debugging. 

Check if the {{Code2|corridor_relays}} ipset gets populated.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo ipset list corridor_relays
}}

It is recommended to also install the {{Code2|usability-misc}} package from Whonix repository, since it provides the {{Code2|iptables-save-deterministic}} command. Alternately, retrieve the package from [[Dev/Firewall_Refactoring|elsewhere]].

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install usability-misc
}}

Run {{Code2|iptables-save-deterministic}}.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo iptables-save-deterministic
}}

In Qubes, the output should be similar to the following.
