= Introduction =
corridor is a Tor traffic whitelisting gateway.

= Connecting to corridor before Tor =
'''UNFINISHED'''

Testers only!

It is possible to configure Whonix-Gateway (sys-whonix) to use corridor as <u>local</u> proxy to establish the following tunnel:<br />
'''User -> corridor -> Tor -> Internet'''

This is not necessarily more anonymous. It is an additional fail-save Tor traffic whitelisting firewall that would protect from accidental clearnet leaks.

If you want to do this, apply the following instructions.

[[Qubes-Whonix]] only! [[Non-Qubes-Whonix]] is [[unsupported]].
