This page documents the differences between Debian and {{project name}} related to networking.

__TOC__

= Base Image =
Debian installer and or various desktop environments (GNOME etc.) might be using systemd-networkd and/or network manager (GUI) to set up networking. This might differ depending on Debian flavors and/or Debian installer options.

The Debian base config assumed in this developer documentation is a [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/build-steps.d/1300_create-raw-image our minimal (grml-)debootstrap] created Debian image. These donâ€™t come with any network configuration at all. Using our minimal base image would have no networking configuration to begin with.

Someone who wanted to build Whonix manually and from scratch would have to start with a minimal base Debian image. Not with for example a Debian XFCE installed with Debian installer DVD since that already comes with functional/different network configuration.
