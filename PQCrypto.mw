== Quantum Computers ==

Quantum computers are based on the phenomena of quantum mechanics as opposed to classical computers familiar to everyone today. They are made up of qubits that can express many different states simultaneously, solving some types of mathematical problems in near instant time. Assembling a quantum computer is now an engineering problem rather than one impeded by laws of physics - a theoretically imperfect machine can still yield useful results. Such a computer is sought after by every heavy-weight signal intelligence agency because of implications for public-key cryptography systems widely used today. Ciphertext unbreakable by today's classical computers will be shredded into ribbons by a large quantum computer. The Snowden documents reveal that every piece of encrypted data traversing the internet is intercepted and stored indefinitely for decryption should there be a breakthrough. A global arms race by the United States, EU, Russia, China and Israel ensues. 

The academic and corporate world estimate that a large quantum computer will be built in 10-15 years from now (as of 2016). Its safe to assume the time is even less for intelligence communities.

== What's broken? ==

All asymmetric public-key crypto algorithms used today - the type of crypto that protects your communications over the internet.

Symmetric crypto key size strength is halved (256-bit drops down to 128-bit) - the type used for Full Disk Encryption, encrypting data with a passphrase.

== What now? ==

The answer is Post-Quantum (PQ) Cryptography. Its a drop in replacement for crypto libraries deployed now except it uses different types of math problems known to be "quantum hard" meaning its just as difficult for a Quantum Computer to solve as it is for Classical ones.

Competent cryptographers are in the process of improving performance of PQ Crypto and designing cipher-suites efficient for everyday use. The Tor Project are [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/17286 planning] to migrate to quantum resistant ciphers by version 0.2.9.x.

[http://pqcrypto.eu.org/docs/initial-recommendations.pdf Initial recommendations] for PQ Crypto algorithms were published September 2015.

== Software ==

This is a listing of Free Software known to known to resist quantum computers and not an endorsement for any particular tool. You are better off setting up arbitrary protocols over Tor [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Hidden_Services Hidden Services] once PQ crypto is deployed to mitigate exposure in case of unknown implementation failures in each and every other tool (with the exception of one-time pads that are information theoretically secure).<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theoretic_security</ref>

Informal adoption checklist:<ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/post-quantum-cryptography-pqc/2011/17</ref>

* Quantum-resistant algorithms have withstood susbstantial cryptanalytic efforts.
* Crypto libraries written by competent cryptographers and audited for correct implementation.
* Widely adopted for better blending in.


=== Setup Guides ===

<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed" style="width:800px">
==== Codecrypt ====

This is a GnuPG-like unix program for encryption and signing that uses only quantum-computer-resistant algorithms:<ref>https://github.com/exaexa/codecrypt</ref><ref>http://e-x-a.org/codecrypt/</ref>

* McEliece cryptosystem (compact QC-MDPC variant) for encryption
* Hash-based Merkle tree algorithm (FMTSeq variant) for digital signatures

Codecrypt is free software. The code is licensed under terms of LGPL3 in a good hope that it will make combinations with other tools easier.

===== Installation =====

Add Debian Sid to repos sources lists.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo su -c "echo -e 'deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ sid main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian-sid.list"
}}

{{Template:Apt-Pinning}}

[[Update]] your package lists.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}

Install Codecrypt.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get -t unstable install codecrypt
}}

==== OneTime ====

One-time pads are the only provably unbreakable encryption scheme ever invented (assuming a  functional/non-backdoored RNG).<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad</ref><ref>http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/onetimepad.htm</ref>

Limitations:

* The message and the key are identical in size - but with large hard-disks these days this is not a problem.
* There is no way to securely contact someone you don't know - you must exchange the one-time pad file with them offline. Sending the pad online makes it as strong as the asymmetric crypto you are using.
* No message integrity. There is no way for the recipient to discover if the ciphertext has been tampered with during transit.
* You must never ever reuse the pad to encrypt another message. Doing so breaks the the encryption.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venona_project#Decryption</ref>
* You can encrypt any file type by converting it into base64 encoded text then passing the output to the one-time pad.


[http://red-bean.com/onetime/ OneTime] is a program that sets up a one-time pad on your computer and protects from reusing pads and shooting yourself in the foot. OneTime is available in Debian.<ref>https://packages.debian.org/search?searchon=names&keywords=onetime</ref>
