Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQCrypto)

== Quantum Computers ==

Quantum computers are based on the phenomena of quantum mechanics as opposed to classical computers familiar to everyone today. They are made up of qubits that can express many different states simultaneously, solving some types of mathematical problems in near instant time. Assembling a quantum computer is now an engineering problem rather than one impeded by laws of physics - a theoretically imperfect machine can still yield useful results. Such a computer is sought after by every heavy-weight signal intelligence agency because of implications for public-key cryptography systems widely used today. Ciphertext unbreakable by today's classical computers will be shredded into ribbons by a large quantum computer. The Snowden documents reveal that every piece of encrypted data traversing the internet is intercepted and stored indefinitely for decryption should there be a breakthrough. A global arms race by the United States, EU, Russia, China and Israel ensues. 

The academic and corporate world estimate that a large quantum computer will be built in 10-15 years from now (as of 2016). Its safe to assume the time is even less for intelligence communities.

== What's broken? ==

All asymmetric public-key crypto algorithms used today - the type of crypto that protects your communications over the internet.

Symmetric crypto key size strength is halved (256-bit drops down to 128-bit) - the type used for Full Disk Encryption, encrypting data with a passphrase.

== What now? ==

The answer is Post-Quantum (PQ) Cryptography. Its a drop in replacement for crypto libraries deployed now except it uses different types of math problems known to be "quantum hard" meaning its just as difficult for a Quantum Computer to solve as it is for Classical ones.

Competent cryptographers are in the process of improving performance of PQ Crypto and designing cipher-suites efficient for everyday use. The Tor Project are [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/17286 planning] to migrate to quantum resistant ciphers by version 0.2.9.x.
