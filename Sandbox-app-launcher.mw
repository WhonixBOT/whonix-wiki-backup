sandbox-app-launcher is an application launcher that starts each app inside its own restrictive sandbox. It runs each app as its own user, in a bubblewrap sandbox and confined by apparmor.

The directory, <code>/shared</code>, is shared across all app sandboxes to transfer files across.

This implements a permissions system to configure what apps can access. There are currently 5 available permissions:

* Network access

* Webcam access

* Microphone access

* Shared storage access (read-only or read-write)

* Dynamic native code execution

All apps the user installs will be automatically configured to run in the sandbox and a prompt will ask the user which permissions they wish to grant the application (not implemented yet).

Currently a WIP and not for actual use.
