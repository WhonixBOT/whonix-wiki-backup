= Platform Specific =
== Qubes ==
After [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/software-update-dom0/ getting all dom0 host upgrades] and reboot this should be ok.

{{Qubes_upgrade_dom0}}

Reboot.

== VirtualBox ==
There is no solution for [[VirtualBox]] yet. The bug has been reported to the VirtualBox developers. See [https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=89395 VirtualBox 5.2.18 vulnerable to spectre/meltdown despite microcode being installed]. The Whonix developers depend on the VirtualBox developers for fixing this VirtualBox issue. Nevertheless:

* Apply [[#Processor Microcode Updates|Processor Microcode Updates]] on your host operating system.
* Apply the following experimental instructions.

{{VirtualBox_Spectre_Meltdown}}

Above instructions cover only default VM names Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation. If you are using [[Multiple Whonix-Workstations]] and/or [[Multiple_Whonix-Workstations#Multiple_Whonix-Gateways|Multiple Whonix-Gateways]], you need to repeat these instructions for all custom created VMs as well.

* Check back later for updated instructions. [[Stay Tuned]].

== KVM ==
Apply [[#Processor Microcode Updates]] on your host operating system. The updated mitigative host CPU instructions are passed through by default. No further action is needed.
