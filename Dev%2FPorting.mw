__FORCETOC__

= Existing Ports of {{project name}} =
* [https://wiki.raptorcs.com/wiki/Whonix {{Whonix}} reported] to be running on POWER9 ([https://wiki.raptorcs.com/wiki/OpenPOWER OpenPOWER]), [https://wiki.raptorcs.com/wiki/Main_Page Raptor] [https://wiki.raptorcs.com/wiki/Talos_II Talos II] using [[Dev/Installation_from_Repository|distro-morphing]].
* [https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-for-arm64-raspberry-pi-rpi/1788 Whonix for <code>arm64</code> / Raspberry Pi ( RPi )] ([[Dev/Build_Documentation/Physical_Isolation#How_To_Install_Whonix-Gateway_.E2.84.A2_on_the_Raspberry_Pi_3_B_.28RPI3.29|wiki]])
* [https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-on-mac-m1-arm/11310 Whonix on Mac M1 (ARM based)]

= Existing Ports of {{kicksecure}} =

* <code>ppc64el</code> {{kicksecure}} functional, created using distro-morphing on a test server for {{project name}} developer Patrick.
* Distro-morphing should generate viable images for KVM on <code>arm64</code>.

== NOTE ==
{{Amd64}}

== Porting Simplicity ==
To simplify ports to other architectures, all of the following packages are optional dependencies. These packages have very useful functionality however to simplify bootstrapping a port of {{project name}} for a quick motivational milestone to reach of {{project name}} building and booting, all architecture specific packages are optional dependencies by design in {{project name}}.

Therefore porters do not need to worry about any of the following packages during original porting work.

Most of {{project name}} packages and all essential packages are architecture independent.

To simplify ports, {{project name}} repository at time of writing supports the following architectures. <ref>

This might be useful for [[Dev/Installation_from_Repository|distro-morphing]].

Distro-morphing might be the easiest way to create a proof of concept port of {{project name}}. Following the spirit of [[Free Support Principle]], first experimenting with Debian (which {{project name}} is based on) first might be helpful.

A production quality, redistributable port of {{project name}} however should be created using {{project name}} build script instead of distro-morphing.
