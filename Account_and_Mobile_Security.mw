= Introduction =

Recent revelations highlight that advanced mobile phone spyware (Pegasus) poses a serious surveillance threat. Quote [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/jul/18/what-is-pegasus-spyware-and-how-does-it-hack-phones The Guardian: What is Pegasus spyware and how does it hack phones?]:

<blockquote>It is the name for perhaps the most powerful piece of spyware ever developed – certainly by a private company. Once it has wormed its way on to your phone, without you noticing, it can turn it into a 24-hour surveillance device. It can copy messages you send or receive, harvest your photos and record your calls. It might secretly film you through your phone’s camera, or activate the microphone to record your conversations. It can potentially pinpoint where you are, where you’ve been, and who you’ve met. ... Pegasus infections can be achieved through so-called “zero-click” attacks, which do not require any interaction from the phone’s owner in order to succeed. These will often exploit “zero-day” vulnerabilities, which are flaws or bugs in an operating system that the mobile phone’s manufacturer does not yet know about and so has not been able to fix. ... Security researchers suspect more recent versions of Pegasus only ever inhabit the phone’s temporary memory, rather than its hard drive, meaning that once the phone is powered down virtually all trace of the software vanishes.</blockquote>

Contrary to propaganda from NSO Group who develop the tool, Pegasus is already in use by many governments worldwide, posing a significant threat to journalists, human rights defenders, political opponents, businesspeople, heads of state and NGOs among others. <ref>https://forbiddenstories.org/pegasus-the-new-global-weapon-for-silencing-journalists/</ref> [https://citizenlab.ca/ The Citizen Lab] has analyzed various NSO zero-day, zero-click exploits and accurately describes their flagrant breaches of international human rights law: <ref>https://citizenlab.ca/2021/09/forcedentry-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/</ref>
<blockquote>Our latest discovery of yet another Apple zero day employed as part of NSO Group’s arsenal further illustrates that companies like NSO Group are facilitating “despotism-as-a-service” for unaccountable government security agencies. Regulation of this growing, highly profitable, and harmful marketplace is desperately needed.</blockquote>

Pegasus threats emphasize that even the most security-conscious individuals cannot prevent such attacks, therefore those at high-risk should limit the use of mobiles for sensitive activities whenever possible:

* A compromised mobile phone could turn on the microphone and eavesdrop without any [[Malware and Firmware Trojans#Indicators_of_Compromise|compromise indicator]] noticeable by the user. 
* The audio leakage from keyboard typing can be used to infer the words up to a certain degree of accuracy. This might reveal passwords; see [[Microphone]].
* Similar risks exist for the in-built camera.
* All content on the mobile phone can potentially be exfiltrated, including contacts, media, messages and documents.
* All browsing and communications history can potentially be monitored.
* Location data might be accessed by adversaries.
* Any other data or activities on the mobile phone is at risk of access/exfiltration.

== Best Practices ==

As outlined in the introduction, threats to mobile devices are increasing in number, scope and complexity. Therefore a complete change in user behavior is necessary to better protect personal devices and personal information. In general, the more device features that are enabled, the greater the loss in security -- avoid enabling features simply for personal convenience.

|-

! scope="row"| '''Applications'''
| 
* Install a minimal number of applications and only those which are essential. 
* Remove unnecessary, default applications if possible. If this is not feasible, then disable the application in settings.
* Only install software from official application stores.
* Be cautious if entering personal data into applications; use false information if possible.
* Fully close (exit) applications when they are not in use.
* Keep all software and applications updated.
| Official store application updates provide partial protection against:
* spearphishing
* malicious applications
* intercepts / untrusted cellular networks
* room audio / video collection
* call / text / data collection over network
* geolocation of device
Updated software and applications provide partial protection against:
* spearphishing
* malicious applications
* zero-click exploits
* malicious Wi-Fi network / close access network attacks
* intercepts / untrusted cellular networks
* room audio / video collection
* close access physical attacks
|-

! scope="row"| '''Attachments / Links'''
| Do not open unknown email attachments and links: 
* Even verified contacts might send malicious content, either accidentally or following a compromise.
* Malicious actors can impersonate a known contact.
| Partial protection against spearphishing and malicious applications.
|-

! scope="row"| '''Bluetooth'''
| 
* Disable Bluetooth when it is not in use, or preferably never activate it. 
* Note that Airplane mode does not always disable Bluetooth.
| 
* Near-complete protection against malicious networks / close access network attacks, and collection of call / text / data over network (when cellular and Wi-Fi networks are also disabled).
* Partial protection against intercepts / untrusted cellular networks, and geolocation of the device.
|-

! scope="row"| '''Biometrics'''
| As noted in the [[2FA#Implementations|2FA]] chapter, do not rely on biometric IDs to protect information or for authentication. <ref>Notably the IC guide only recommends biometrics to protect low-value information.</ref>
| 
* Biometric IDs cannot ever be changed if compromised.
* Volunteering of biometric data is a privacy intrusion and risk.
|-

! scope="row"| '''Case'''
| 
* Consider using a protective case that "drowns" (mutes) the microphone to protect again potential eavesdropping.
* Cover the camera when it is not in use.
| Near-complete protection against room audio/video collection.

== SIM Swap Scam ==

Essential knowledge: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam SIM Swap Scam]

Due to SIM Swap Scam and [[#Malicious SMS Re-Routing|Malicious SMS Re-Routing]], consider setting a registration lock. This prevents someone who has gotten access to your mobile number from re-registration without knowing the pin code for re-registration.

* [[Signal]] messenger: three dots &rarr; settings &rarr; privacy &rarr; scroll down &rarr; Registration Lock PIN
* Telegram: settings &rarr; privacy and security &rarr; two factor authentication
* WhatsApp: settings &rarr; account &rarr; Two-step verification

== Malicious SMS Re-Routing ==

Even without [[#SIM Swap Scam|SIM Swap Scam]], attackers can do [https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3g8wb/hacker-got-my-texts-16-dollars-sakari-netnumber malicious SMS re-routing].

== Two-factor Authentication (2FA) ==

Even users who are knowledgeable about bulk phishing or spear phishing can benefit from 2FA. See [[Two-factor_authentication_2FA|Two-factor Authentication (2FA)]].

== Phone Number Security Compartmentalization ==

Consider using at least two different mobile phone numbers. One that you give to friends, colleges, etc. To real people. The other phone number you give only to banks and perhaps other money sensitive services that require SMS as a second factor or as a means to contact you.

The rationale behind this is that people you know might give your mobile number to others. Or their mobile phone may be hacked or stolen. Thereby or through other means your mobile number might end up being published on the internet. This might make you a target for SIM swap scam. However, if you used different phone numbers in different places, a SIM swap scam would cause less damage.

A phone which is being carried outside and daily is more likely to get stolen or robbed than a phone which most of the time is being kept in a safe(er) location. Thereby using your everyday phone, the thief at least does not get a chance to fraudulently access any bank accounts.

Due to possible SIM swap scam:

* Avoid using a phone number (SMS) for [[Two-factor authentication 2FA|Two-factor authentication (2FA)]] whenever possible and use better options such as "google authenticator". It doesn't or shouldn't have to be literally be "google authenticator" but any alternative 2FA application. See [[Two-factor authentication 2FA|2FA]] for more information.
* Inform all contacts of a possible SIM swap scam. Should they receive any requests for money or other strange requests, encourage them to call you instead to confirm.
* Prefer messengers or other chat applications that support a Registration Lock PIN over SMS.
