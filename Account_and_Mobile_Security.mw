= Introduction =

Recent revelations highlight that advanced mobile phone spyware (Pegasus) poses a serious surveillance threat. Quote [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/jul/18/what-is-pegasus-spyware-and-how-does-it-hack-phones The Guardian: What is Pegasus spyware and how does it hack phones?]:

<blockquote>It is the name for perhaps the most powerful piece of spyware ever developed – certainly by a private company. Once it has wormed its way on to your phone, without you noticing, it can turn it into a 24-hour surveillance device. It can copy messages you send or receive, harvest your photos and record your calls. It might secretly film you through your phone’s camera, or activate the microphone to record your conversations. It can potentially pinpoint where you are, where you’ve been, and who you’ve met. ... Pegasus infections can be achieved through so-called “zero-click” attacks, which do not require any interaction from the phone’s owner in order to succeed. These will often exploit “zero-day” vulnerabilities, which are flaws or bugs in an operating system that the mobile phone’s manufacturer does not yet know about and so has not been able to fix. ... Security researchers suspect more recent versions of Pegasus only ever inhabit the phone’s temporary memory, rather than its hard drive, meaning that once the phone is powered down virtually all trace of the software vanishes.</blockquote>

Contrary to propaganda from NSO Group who develop the tool, Pegasus is already in use by many governments worldwide, posing a significant threat to journalists, human rights defenders, political opponents, businesspeople, heads of state and NGOs among others. <ref>https://forbiddenstories.org/pegasus-the-new-global-weapon-for-silencing-journalists/</ref> [https://citizenlab.ca/ The Citizen Lab] has analyzed various NSO zero-day, zero-click exploits and accurately describes their flagrant breaches of international human rights law: <ref>https://citizenlab.ca/2021/09/forcedentry-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/</ref>
<blockquote>Our latest discovery of yet another Apple zero day employed as part of NSO Group’s arsenal further illustrates that companies like NSO Group are facilitating “despotism-as-a-service” for unaccountable government security agencies. Regulation of this growing, highly profitable, and harmful marketplace is desperately needed.</blockquote>

Pegasus threats emphasize that even the most security-conscious individuals cannot prevent such attacks, therefore those at high-risk should limit the use of mobiles for sensitive activities whenever possible:

* A compromised mobile phone could turn on the microphone and eavesdrop without any [[Malware and Firmware Trojans#Indicators_of_Compromise|compromise indicator]] noticeable by the user. 
* The audio leakage from keyboard typing can be used to infer the words up to a certain degree of accuracy. This might reveal passwords; see [[Microphone]].
* Similar risks exist for the in-built camera.
* All content on the mobile phone can potentially be exfiltrated, including contacts, media, messages and documents.
* All browsing and communications history can potentially be monitored.
* Location data might be accessed by adversaries.
* Any other data or activities on the mobile phone is at risk of access/exfiltration.

== Best Practices ==

As outlined in the introduction, threats to mobile devices are increasing in number, scope and complexity. Therefore a complete change in user behavior is necessary to better protect personal devices and information. In general, the more device features that are enabled, the greater the loss in security -- avoid enabling features simply for personal convenience.

== Hardware Identifiers ==

Various identifiers are available to uniquely identify and locate mobile devices, including [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mobile_Equipment_Identity International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI)] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_mobile_subscriber_identity International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI)].

=== International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) ===

IMEI is a 15 or 17-digit number, usually unique, which is used to identify valid mobile devices on networks (including some satellite phones). <ref>Inspect the SIM tray or battery compartment of the phone to identify this number.</ref> It can be used to stop stolen devices from accessing the network via a blocklist, even if the subscribed identity module (SIM) is changed. <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mobile_Equipment_Identity</ref> It can also be used to locate lost devices, as various services and applications already provide this function. <ref>Including Android IMEI tracker applications.</ref>

Police, military and government agencies use IMEI as a tracking device, as it can locate mobile devices to within a few meters. The reason is when a mobile device connects to towers, the IMEI and other unique identifiers are shared. Therefore agencies can easily verify the physical location of all phones in a given location, as this information is shared with the government and is subject to warrants and other requests. For example: <ref>https://www.businessinsider.com/saudi-arabia-imei-track-runaways-2019-5</ref>
* The military utilize IMEI for targeted drone strikes. <ref>https://theintercept.com/drone-papers/the-assassination-complex/</ref>
* Saudi authorities have used IMEI to track women fleeing the regime.
* Changing the SIM card will only change the IMSI number (see below) and the IMEI number is unchanged; this action just alerts mobile device companies that a new SIM has been inserted. <ref>https://itigic.com/can-government-spy-on-my-mobile-imei/</ref>
* The IC already utilize IMEI/IMSI catchers for geo-location tracking, eavesdropping, traffic interception and identity extraction. <ref>https://www.thespyphone.com/portable-imsi-imei-catcher/</ref> <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMSI-catcher</ref> In simple terms, "fake" mobile towers perform a [[Warning#Man-in-the-middle_Attacks|Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack]] between the target mobile device and the service provider's real towers.

The only ways to avoid IMEI tracking are: replacing the handset; physical removal and replacement of a chip to obtain a new IMEI (illegal in many jurisdictions); utilizing a phone with reprogrammable IMEI; or using devices without a SIM card slot (as they do not have an IMEI). Notably, many jurisdictions require IMEI registration in order to access mobile networks.

=== International Mobile Subscribed Identity ===

IMEI is only linked to the device and does not have a particular relationship to the subscriber; that function is related to the IMSI number. IMSI is usually a 15-digit number that uniquely identifies every user of a cellular network, as it is sent by the mobile device to the network: <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_mobile_subscriber_identity</ref> 
<blockquote>The first 3 digits represent the mobile country code (MCC), which is followed by the mobile network code (MNC), either 2-digit (European standard) or 3-digit (North American standard). The length of the MNC depends on the value of the MCC, and it is recommended that the length is uniform within a MCC area. The remaining digits are the mobile subscription identification number (MSIN) within the network's customer base, usually 9 to 10 digits long, depending on the length of the MNC.</blockquote>

Notably the IMSI is linked to mobile subscriptions or pre-paid plans, the phone number provided by a mobile service, and is hardcoded on the SIM card so it cannot be changed. As both the IMEI and IMSI are registered every time a mobile network connection is made, it is easy for agencies to track this information and query it as necessary. 

Numerous ISMI vulnerabilities exist for potential exploitation:
* While the IMSI is rarely transmitted and is instead replaced by a temporary mobile subscriber entity (TSMI) to try and prevent eavesdroppers/hackers and identity verification <ref>https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5067/international-mobile-subscriber-identity-imsi</ref> recent 4G and 5G hacks re-enabled the effectiveness of "Stingray Attacks" via ISMI catchers. <ref>https://thehackernews.com/2019/02/location-tracking-imsi-catchers.html</ref>
* Researchers have demonstrated IMSI catcher attacks are possible via the Wi-Fi protocol, allowing detailed tracking and MITM attacks. <ref>https://thehackernews.com/2016/11/imsi-track-cellphone.html</ref>
* Numerous devices are available to exploit ISMI for either passive dragnet surveillance or for targeted attacks; see [https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/cellphone-surveillance-the-secret-arsenal/ here].

=== Conclusion ===

In summary, it is evident the IMEI and IMSI identifiers alone pose serious privacy and security threats to mobile devices. Mobile operators and mobile OS software routinely store this information, and the existing protocols are prone to exploitation and allow detailed tracking of movements due to mobile tower triangulation. "Anonymous SIMs" are also a mirage because this will not change the underlying IMEI identifier linked to the handset, which can normally be traced to the purchaser. Further, advanced IMEI/IMSI catcher technology makes it highly like that any targeted mobile device can be easily exploited.

If a mobile device is required for truly anonymous activity, then the best chance is sourcing a dedicated  anonymous phone number and/or an anonymous burner phone. This would necessitate an anonymous SIM card (pre-paid with cash) that cannot be linked to you personally. Achieving this goal is difficult -- and potentially illegal depending on the jurisdiction -- and is outside the scope of this documentation. 

== SIM Swap Scam ==

Essential knowledge: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam SIM Swap Scam]

Due to SIM Swap Scam and [[#Malicious SMS Re-Routing|Malicious SMS Re-Routing]], consider setting a registration lock. This prevents someone who has gotten access to your mobile number from re-registration without knowing the pin code for re-registration.

* [[Signal]] messenger: three dots &rarr; settings &rarr; privacy &rarr; scroll down &rarr; Registration Lock PIN
* Telegram: settings &rarr; privacy and security &rarr; two factor authentication
* WhatsApp: settings &rarr; account &rarr; Two-step verification

== Malicious SMS Re-Routing ==

Even without [[#SIM Swap Scam|SIM Swap Scam]], attackers can do [https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3g8wb/hacker-got-my-texts-16-dollars-sakari-netnumber malicious SMS re-routing].

== Two-factor Authentication (2FA) ==

Even users who are knowledgeable about bulk phishing or spear phishing can benefit from 2FA. See [[Two-factor_authentication_2FA|Two-factor Authentication (2FA)]].

== Phone Number Security Compartmentalization ==

Consider using at least two different mobile phone numbers. One that you give to friends, colleges, etc. To real people. The other phone number you give only to banks and perhaps other money sensitive services that require SMS as a second factor or as a means to contact you.

The rationale behind this is that people you know might give your mobile number to others. Or their mobile phone may be hacked or stolen. Thereby or through other means your mobile number might end up being published on the internet. This might make you a target for SIM swap scam. However, if you used different phone numbers in different places, a SIM swap scam would cause less damage.

A phone which is being carried outside and daily is more likely to get stolen or robbed than a phone which most of the time is being kept in a safe(er) location. Thereby using your everyday phone, the thief at least does not get a chance to fraudulently access any bank accounts.

Due to possible SIM swap scam:

* Avoid using a phone number (SMS) for [[Two-factor authentication 2FA|Two-factor authentication (2FA)]] whenever possible and use better options such as "google authenticator". It doesn't or shouldn't have to be literally be "google authenticator" but any alternative 2FA application. See [[Two-factor authentication 2FA|2FA]] for more information.
* Inform all contacts of a possible SIM swap scam. Should they receive any requests for money or other strange requests, encourage them to call you instead to confirm.
* Prefer messengers or other chat applications that support a Registration Lock PIN over SMS.
