= {{Workstation product name}} Overview =

[[Whonix-Workstation|{{Workstation product name}}]] is software. After installation of {{project name}}, {{Workstation product name}} will be connected to [[Whonix-Gateway|{{Gateway product name}}]]. The latter runs Tor processes and acts as a gateway, while the former runs user applications on a completely isolated network.

{{Workstation product name}} is the place where all user applications like [[Tor Browser]] should be launched. This also ensures applications will utilize the Tor network because only Tor connections are permitted.

{{project_name}} also provides stream isolation for many pre-installed or custom-installed applications when they are used simultaneously in {{Workstation product name}}. For example, Tor Browser, Hexchat, Thunderbird and several other applications use a dedicated Tor SocksPort, preventing identity (pseudonym) correlation that may otherwise occur when the same Tor circuit and exit relay are used.

To learn more about {{Project name}} see [[Main Page]], [[About]] and [[Features]].
