= {{Workstation product name}} Overview =

[[Whonix-Workstation|{{Workstation product name}}]] is software. After installation of {{project name}}, {{Workstation product name}} will be connected to [[Whonix-Gateway|{{Gateway product name}}]]. The latter runs Tor processes and acts as a gateway, while the former runs user applications on a completely isolated network.

{{Workstation product name}} is the place where all user applications like [[Tor Browser]] should be launched. This also ensures applications will utilize the Tor network because only Tor connections are permitted.

{{project_name}} also provides stream isolation for many pre-installed or custom-installed applications when they are used simultaneously in {{Workstation product name}}. For example, Tor Browser, Hexchat, Thunderbird and several other applications use a dedicated Tor SocksPort, preventing identity (pseudonym) correlation that may otherwise occur when the same Tor circuit and exit relay are used.

{{Workstation product name}} is already pre-configured for use with {{Gateway product name}}.

For a functional network connection, {{Workstation product name}} requires a running {{Gateway product name}}. It is therefore recommended to first start {{Gateway product name}} before {{Workstation product name}}.

But it is also OK if the startup sequence is reversed. If {{Gateway product name}} is off, {{Workstation product name}} can only be used offline. Even without a running {{Gateway product name}} there is no way {{Workstation product name}} could connect to the clearnet internet. In other words, {{project name}} is fail-safe. <ref>
[[Dev/Technical_Introduction|Technical Introduction]].
</ref> {{Workstation product name}} will either use Tor network or have no network connectivity at all.
