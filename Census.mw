= {{project_name}} User Count Design =
There are strict requirements for the {{project_name}} user count:

* no private info transferred at all
* adds no additional risk other than that of apt-get communicating with {{project_name}} servers which users are doing anyway to their systems updated
* only on {{gateway_product_name}}
* no unique identifiers of any kind
* all transmissions go through Tor
* all transmissions are using {{project name}} Tor onion v3 service
* no IP addresses are ever collected
* only one submission within 24 hours
* can be easily disabled
* secured through an AppArmor profile and systemd hardening (seccomp) by default
* inspired by [https://cleaninsights.org Clean Insights (Privacy-Preserving Measurement)] by [https://guardianproject.info Guardian Project], [https://matomo.org/ Matomo] (formerly Piwik, is a free and open source web analytics application), [https://metrics.torproject.org Tor Metrics]

= Rationale for {{project_name}} User Count =

* Feedback for maintainers of {{project name}} if the number of {{project name}} users increases over time.
* Some people decide based on impact to which project these would like to [[contribute]].
* Capability to answer questions such as does {{project name}} have more users than lets say for example a project which was founded a year ago.
* Comparison of number of users of Tor, Tails, {{project name}}.
* Users can decide if these would like to share the same [[Fingerprint]] as 100 or thousands of other users.
* Web and network [[fingerprint]] considerations.
* Data is available already anyhow through [[whonixcheck]]'s automated verification of [[Trust#{{project name short}}_.E2.84.A2_Warrant_Canary|{{project name}} warrant canary]]. <ref>

= Disable {{project_name}} User Count =
{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = {{gateway_product_name}} only.
}}

This will prevent the anonymous, daily {{project_name}} census.
