= {{project_name}} User Count Statistic =
{{metrics}}

User count is manually updated every now and then. Low priority.

Explanation what <code><u>daily</u> {{Gateway product name}}
users</code> means:

* <u>Total amount of {{project name}} users</u>: The <u>total</u> number of {{project name}} is probably higher than the number of <u>daily</u> {{Gateway product name}} users.
* <u>New day, still running, new count</u>: A {{Gateway product name}} that runs longer than 1 day (24 hours) will re-fetch {{project name}} warrant canary and therefore be counted again.
* <u>New day, new boot, new count</u>: A {{Gateway product name}} that has not been run for longer than 1 day (24 hours) will re-fetch {{project name}} warrant canary and therefore be counted again.
* <u>Duplication</u>: Users using multiple {{Gateway product name}} are counted multiple times. There is no probably no way to avoid that with the current design (see next chapter).
* <u>Non-Duplication</u>: Boots are not explicitly counted. Counting every user every time a {{Gateway product name}} is booted would lead to less accurate results since many users start and shutdown their computers multiple times per day.
* <u>Non-Live</u>: Live users are not counted.

= {{project_name}} User Count Design =
There are strict requirements for the {{project_name}} user count:

* No private information transferred at all.
* No unique identifiers of any kind.
* No IP addresses are ever collected. <ref>
By using an onion service, the server has no way to log originating IP addresses.

Privacy policy for <code>{{project_clearnet}}</code> website is different. See [[Privacy Policy]] chapter [[Privacy_Policy#IP_Addresses_and_IP_Addresses_Logging_Policy|IP Addresses and IP Addresses Logging Policy]] and [[Trust#Trusting the {{project_name}} Website|Trusting the {{project_name}} Website]].

* Count only once within 24 hours.
* [[#Disable {{project_name}} User Count|Can be easily disabled.]]
* By-product of, and based on [[whonixcheck]]'s automated [[whonixcheck#Warrant Canary Check|Warrant Canary Check]] which downloads and verifies [[Trust#{{project name short}}_.E2.84.A2_Warrant_Canary|{{project name}} warrant canary]].
** Download over Tor.
** Download using {{project name}} Tor onion v3 service.
** Similar to [[sdwdate]] fetching time from onion time sources.

= Rationale for {{project_name}} User Count =

* Feedback for maintainers of {{project name}} if the number of {{project name}} users increases over time.
* Some people decide based on impact to which project these would like to [[contribute]].
* Capability to answer questions such as does {{project name}} have more users than lets say for example a project which was founded a year ago.
* Comparison of number of users of Tor, Tails, {{project name}}.
* Users can decide if these would like to share the same [[Fingerprint]] as 100 or thousands of other users.
* Web and network [[fingerprint]] considerations.
* Data is available already anyhow through [[whonixcheck]]'s automated verification of [[Trust#{{project name short}}_.E2.84.A2_Warrant_Canary|{{project name}} warrant canary]]. <ref>
