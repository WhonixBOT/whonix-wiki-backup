= {{project_name}} User Count Statistic =
{{metrics}}

User count is manually updated every now and then. Low priority.

= {{project_name}} User Count Design =
There are strict requirements for the {{project_name}} user count:

* No private information transferred at all.
* Only on {{gateway_product_name}}.
* No unique identifiers of any kind.
* All transmissions go through Tor.
* All transmissions are using {{project name}} Tor onion v3 service.
* No IP addresses are ever collected.
* Count only once within 24 hours.
* [[#Disable {{project_name}} User Count|Can be easily disabled.]]
* Based on [[whonixcheck]]'s automated [[whonixcheck#Warrant Canary Check|Warrant Canary Check]] which verifies [[Trust#{{project name short}}_.E2.84.A2_Warrant_Canary|{{project name}} warrant canary]].
* Security: See, same as [[whonixcheck#Warrant Canary Check|Warrant Canary Check]].
* Inspired by [https://cleaninsights.org Clean Insights (Privacy-Preserving Measurement)] by [https://guardianproject.info Guardian Project], [https://matomo.org/ Matomo] (formerly Piwik, is a free and open source web analytics application), [https://metrics.torproject.org Tor Metrics], [https://tails.boum.org/support/faq/index.en.html#boot-statistics Tails boot statistics].

= Rationale for {{project_name}} User Count =

* Feedback for maintainers of {{project name}} if the number of {{project name}} users increases over time.
* Some people decide based on impact to which project these would like to [[contribute]].
* Capability to answer questions such as does {{project name}} have more users than lets say for example a project which was founded a year ago.
* Comparison of number of users of Tor, Tails, {{project name}}.
* Users can decide if these would like to share the same [[Fingerprint]] as 100 or thousands of other users.
* Web and network [[fingerprint]] considerations.
* Data is available already anyhow through [[whonixcheck]]'s automated verification of [[Trust#{{project name short}}_.E2.84.A2_Warrant_Canary|{{project name}} warrant canary]]. <ref>
