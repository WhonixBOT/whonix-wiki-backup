= {{project_name}} User Count Design =
There are strict requirements for the {{project_name}} user count:

* No private info transferred at all.
* Adds no additional risk. Similar to apt-get communicating with {{project_name}} servers which users are doing anyway to their systems updated or [[sdwdate]] fetching from time from onions.
* Only on {{gateway_product_name}}.
* No unique identifiers of any kind.
* All transmissions go through Tor.
* All transmissions are using {{project name}} Tor onion v3 service.
* No IP addresses are ever collected.
* Only one submission within 24 hours.
* Can be easily disabled.
* Based on [[whonixcheck]]'s automated [[whonixcheck#Warrant Canary Check|Warrant Canary Check]] which verifies [[Trust#{{project name short}}_.E2.84.A2_Warrant_Canary|{{project name}} warrant canary]].
* Secured through python3-requests, an [https://gitlab.com/whonix/systemcheck/-/blob/master/etc/apparmor.d/usr.lib.systemcheck.canary AppArmor profile] and [https://gitlab.com/whonix/systemcheck/-/blob/master/lib/systemd/system/canary.service systemd hardening (seccomp)] by default.
* Inspired by [https://cleaninsights.org Clean Insights (Privacy-Preserving Measurement)] by [https://guardianproject.info Guardian Project], [https://matomo.org/ Matomo] (formerly Piwik, is a free and open source web analytics application), [https://metrics.torproject.org Tor Metrics].

= Rationale for {{project_name}} User Count =

* Feedback for maintainers of {{project name}} if the number of {{project name}} users increases over time.
* Some people decide based on impact to which project these would like to [[contribute]].
* Capability to answer questions such as does {{project name}} have more users than lets say for example a project which was founded a year ago.
* Comparison of number of users of Tor, Tails, {{project name}}.
* Users can decide if these would like to share the same [[Fingerprint]] as 100 or thousands of other users.
* Web and network [[fingerprint]] considerations.
* Data is available already anyhow through [[whonixcheck]]'s automated verification of [[Trust#{{project name short}}_.E2.84.A2_Warrant_Canary|{{project name}} warrant canary]]. <ref>
