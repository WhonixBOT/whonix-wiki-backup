= How-to: Open a Port in {{workstation_product_name}} Firewall =

== Open an Incoming Port in {{workstation_product_name}} Firewall ==

'''<code>{{Gateway product name}}</code> &rarr; <code>{{workstation_product_name}}</code> &rarr; <code>server running inside {{workstation_product_name}}</code>

This allows for an incoming connection from {{Gateway product name}}. This is useful for various purposes such as making [[Onion Services]] reachable.

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' {{Firewall Settings Workstation}}

'''2.''' Add. 

Replace <code>80</code> with the actual port you would like to open.

{{CodeSelect|code=
EXTERNAL_OPEN_PORTS+=" 80 "
}}

'''3.''' Save.

'''4.''' {{Reload_Firewall_ws}}

The procedure is complete.
}}

== Open an Outgoing Port in {{workstation_product_name}} Firewall ==

{{Firewall Custom}}

'''<code>{{workstation product name}}</code> &rarr; <code>{{gateway_product_name}}</code> &rarr; Tor <code>SocksPort</code>

This allows for an outgoing connection to {{Gateway product name}}.

This might be useful for [[Tor#Additional_SocksPorts|Tor additional <code>SocksPort</code>s]].

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Reminder on opening outgoing ports.

This is usually not required since {{Workstation product name}} firewall does not restrict what ports on {{Gateway product name}} are reachable if these are open in {{Gateway product name}} firewall.

It is only useful to prevent connections to Tor SocksPorts in timesync-fail-closed firewall mode. <ref>
https://phabricator.whonix.org/T533#11025
</ref>

'''2.''' {{Firewall Settings Workstation}}

'''3.''' Add.

Note: 
* Replace <code>9230</code> with the actual port you would like to open. 
* Replace <code>SOCKS_PORT_CUSTOM</code> with <code>SOCKS_PORT_ANOTHER</code> when using multiple connections. 
* Replace word <code>ANOTHER</code> with another unique word.

Up to {{project name}} version <code>15.0.1.7.2</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
SOCKS_PORT_CUSTOM=" 9230 "
}}

The syntax will change in later {{project name}} versions. <ref>
https://forums.whonix.org/t/internal-open-ports-setting/11404/1
</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
INTERNAL_OPEN_PORTS+=" 9230 "
}}

Adding both settings to the firewall settings file is okay.

'''4.''' Save.

'''5.''' {{Reload_Firewall_ws}}

The procedure is complete.

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = This procedure is usually not required and should be avoided.
}}

This allows for an incoming connection from {{Gateway product name}}. This is useful for various purposes such as making [[Onion Services]] reachable.

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' {{Firewall Settings Workstation}}

'''2.''' Add.

{{CodeSelect|code=
EXTERNAL_OPEN_ALL=true
}}

Save.

'''3.''' {{Reload_Firewall_ws}}

The procedure is complete.
}}

= Disable {{workstation_product_name}} Firewall Until Reboot =

Perform this action inside {{Workstation product name}} -- see [[Dev/Firewall_Unload|Firewall Unload]].

= Permanently Disable {{workstation_product_name}} Firewall =

Perform this action inside {{Workstation product name}}.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl mask whonix-firewall
}}

No firewall rules will load after rebooting.

= Ping =

Ping commands should <u>not</u> work for external addresses from the {{workstation_product_name}}. The reason is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol ICMP traffic] is not proxied and it is filtered by {{project name}} Firewall (<code>{{W_Firewall}}</code>) because [[Tor#UDP|Tor does not support UDP]]. For example, <code>ping google.com</code> will not work. To make ping functional, see the [[#Allow UDP|Allow UDP]] chapter.

When [[SUID Disabler and Permission Hardener]] is enabled in the future, <ref>It was not enabled by default at the time of writing.</ref> the <code>CAP_NET_RAW</code> capability will be removed from <code>ping</code> to reduce the attack surface since it would not work anyway. <ref>
https://github.com/Whonix/anon-apps-config/blob/master/etc/permission-hardening.d/30_ping.conf
</ref> When that occurs, to re-enable <code>ping</code> functionality refer to the  [[SUID_Disabler_and_Permission_Hardener#Whitelist_Specific_Capability_Binaries|Whitelist Specific Capability Binaries]] chapter.

= Allow UDP =

{{Tor_UDP}}

To allow allow UDP, follow the following steps.

{{CodeSelect|code=

Save.

'''3.''' {{Reload_Firewall_ws}}

The procedure is complete. {{Workstation product name}} firewall will now permit UDP.
