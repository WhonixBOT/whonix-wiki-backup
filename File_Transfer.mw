|-

! scope="row"| All methods
| 
* There is a risk of transferring [[Metadata]] or other sensitive information into {{workstation_product_name}}.
* {{project name}} is designed with isolation in mind. Isolation is weakened if data is imported from the host or other media into {{workstation_product_name}}, therefore this activity must be performed carefully.
|-

! scope="row"| Adding Host-Only Networking adapter to {{workstation_product_name}}
| This method is unrecommended. For further details, see: [[Whonix-Workstation_Security#Adding_a_Host-Only_Networking_Adapter_to_Whonix-Workstation_.E2.84.A2_.2F_SSH_into_Whonix-Workstation_.E2.84.A2|Adding a Host-Only Networking Adapter to Whonix-Workstation ™ / SSH into Whonix-Workstation ™]].

| 
* [https://www.lifewire.com/iso-file-2625923 ISO files/images] can be transferred: <code>Host</code> &rarr; <code>{{gateway_product_name}}/Workstation</code>.
* This is the safest method of transferring files into {{workstation_product_name}}.
|-

! scope="row"| Mounting Virtual Machine images
| 
This method is unrecommended:
* It is unknown if this procedure is feasible.
* If possible, it is unclear what could possibly leak into the Virtual Machine image.
* See also: [[Dev/Build Anonymity]].

|-

! scope="row"| Shared Folder
| This method is currently recommended.

| File transfers work with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell Secure Shell Protocol (SSH)], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Copy_Protocol Secure Copy Protocol (SCP)] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSHFS SSH Filesystem (SSHFS)]; see instructions further below.
|-

! scope="row" | USB devices plugged into VirtualBox
| 
This method is unrecommended for several reasons:
* Hardware serials of the USB controller and/or USB device could leak into {{workstation_product_name}}.
* It requires closed source VirtualBox extensions.
* It is a security risk to plug USB controllers into untrusted virtual machines.

== Transfer Files via ISO Images ==

This section describes how to transfer files from the host into {{gateway_product_name}} or {{workstation_product_name}} via ISO images.

=== Linux Host ===

==== Brasero ====

Brasero is: <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brasero_(software)</ref>
<blockquote>...a free and open-source disc-burning program for Unix-like operating systems, it serves as a graphical front-end (using GTK) to cdrtools, cdrskin, growisofs, and (optionally) libburn.</blockquote>

# Follow the same procedure for burning a data disk with Brasero; see [https://help.gnome.org/users/brasero/stable/project-image-burn.html.en here] and [https://www.linux.com/news/using-brasero-data-backup-and-iso-burning/ here] for instructions.
# Select the option to create an ISO.
# Navigate to the following area: <code>Virtual machine window menu</code> &rarr; <code>Devices</code> &rarr; <code>CD/DVD devices</code> &rarr; <code>Choose a virtual disk</code>.

==== Command line ====

[https://wiki.debian.org/genisoimage genisoimage] is a command-line tool for creating ISO filesystem images from the terminal.

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Install genisoimage.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install genisoimage
}}

'''2.''' Create an ISO "files.iso" containing the content of "folder".

Replace <code>files.iso</code> and <code>/path/to/folder</code> with the preferred ISO name and suitable path to the folder content.

{{CodeSelect|code=
genisoimage -o files.iso /path/to/folder
}}

'''3.''' Mount the newly created ISO.

Use the VirtualBox GUI to mount the newly created ISO which is a virtual VM CD/DVD drive.

'''4.''' Create the <code>/media/cdrom</code> folder inside {{workstation_product_name}}.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo mkdir -p /media/cdrom
}}

'''5.''' Attach/mount the ISO to the VM.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo mount /dev/sr0 /media/cdrom
}}

'''6.''' Navigate into the folder.

{{CodeSelect|code=
cd /media/cdrom
}}

'''7.''' Review the files.

{{CodeSelect|code=
dir
}}
}}

This procedure is intentionally one-way as the {{workstation_product_name}} is inherently untrusted. This way it remains isolated to prevent side-channel attacks and covert channel leaks.

= KVM =
See [[KVM#Shared_Folders|KVM: Shared Folders]].

= VirtualBox =
== Shared Folder ==

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = This procedure is recommended.
}}

This method works when {{project name}} is able to start normally. If {{project name}} does not start properly, then another option like [[#Mount Disk Image|Mount Disk Image]] is required. Refer to the  [[VirtualBox/Guest_Additions#Shared_Folder|VirtualBox Shared Folder]] entry for further details.

== Mount Disk Image ==

The following steps are all performed inside the host operating system.

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Shut down any running {{project name}} virtual machines. 

* It is recommended to back-up data to avoid any potential data loss.
* Never run the {{project name}} VM that is currently mounted because that can lead to data loss. Always unmount first.

'''2.''' {{Update}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}

'''3.''' Install qemu.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install qemu 
}}

'''4.''' Load the Network Block Device kernel module.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo modprobe nbd max_part=16
}}

'''5.''' Attach the disk image (<code>.vmdk</code>) to one of the newly created network block devices.

The example below uses <code>{{project_name_short}}-ws.vmdk</code>. This is stored in the default place created by VirtualBox for VMs: <code>/home/user/VirtualBox VMs</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo qemu-nbd -c /dev/nbd0 '/home/user/VirtualBox VMs/{{workstation_product_name_short}}/{{workstation_product_name_short}}-13.0.0.1.5-disk1.vmdk'
}}

<ref>
<code>sudo modprobe nbd max_part=16</code> is used instead of <code>sudo modprobe nbd</code> to avoid the following error:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo qemu-nbd -c /dev/nbd0 '/home/user/VirtualBox VMs/{{workstation_product_name_short}}/{{workstation_product_name_short}}-13.0.0.1.5-disk1.vmdk'
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
Failed to open /dev/nbd0: No such file or directory /build/qemu-XXUWBP/qemu-2.1+dfsq/nbd.c:nbd_receive_request ():L756: read failed
}}

This might relate to an old bug.
</ref> <ref>
https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-822672-start-0.html
</ref>

'''6.''' Create a mount point. 

For example.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/workstation
}}

A partition manager like <code>cfdisk</code> could be run on the block device, but it is more likely you will want to mount an individual partition.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo mount /dev/nbd0p1 /mnt/workstation
}}

The procedure is complete. A new partition with {{workstation_product_name}} mounted inside it will be visible. 

'''7.''' Unmount everything when finished.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo umount /mnt/workstation
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo qemu-nbd -d /dev/nbd0
}}

After unmounting, the {{project name}} VM can be safely restarted.
}}

== Transfer Files via a VDI File ==

This section describes how to transfer files from one {{workstation_product_name}} to a different {{workstation_product_name}} via a VDI file. 

=== Linux ===

The procedure below is one of the more convenient solutions for copying work from one {{workstation_product_name}} to another. 

{{Box|text=
# The virtual machine that will be edited needs to be powered off.
# In VirtualBox: <code>Click on "Settings" for the {{project name}} Workstation that you wish to copy files from</code> &rarr; <code>click on "Storage"</code>. 
# <code>Select "Storage" settings</code> &rarr; <code>click on the square with a + sign</code> &rarr; <code>select "add hard disk" (located next to the "Controller: {{project_name}}" entry)</code>.
# In the next window that appears, click on <code>create new disk</code>.
# When prompted: <code>Choose a "hard drive file type"</code> &rarr; <code>select "VDI"</code>.
# When prompted: <code>Choose "storage on physical hard drive"</code> &rarr; <code>select "dynamically allocated"</code>.
# In the next window: <code>Type "WhonixTransferBackup" for the drive name</code> &rarr; <code>choose the needed storage capacity</code>. In many cases, the default "8.00 GB" will be enough.
# After returning to the "Settings" window, click the "OK" button.
# Start the {{project name}} Workstation that you wish to transfer files from. After reaching the desktop, open a Terminal/Konsole session. 
# Format the newly created drive: {{CodeSelect|code=
sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
}}
# At the command prompt: <code>Type "n" create a new partition</code> &rarr; <code>press "enter" to choose the default options when prompted until returned to fdisk's main menu</code> &rarr; <code>type "w" to write the partition and exit fdisk</code>.
# In the terminal session, type: {{CodeSelect|code=
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
}}
# Create a new directory to be the mount point for the drive: {{CodeSelect|code=
mkdir temp
}}
# Mount the new drive: {{CodeSelect|code=
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 temp
}}
# Change the permissions of the mount folder so it is possible to write to the drive: {{CodeSelect|code=
sudo chmod 777 temp
}}
# Copy selected files to the new drive by copying them to the "temp" folder. This is possible in the terminal, with the file browser and so on.  Once all files have been copied to the "temp" folder, shut down the {{project name}} Workstation.
# After the {{project name}} Workstation has closed, open the "Virtual Media Manager" in VirtualBox:  <code> Click on "File &rarr; Virtual Media Manager"</code>.
# <code>Locate the new VDI file created in steps 2-8</code> &rarr; <code>click on it</code> &rarr; <code>click the "copy" button</code> &rarr; <code>click the "next" button</code>.
# When prompted to choose a "hard drive file type,"  select "VDI".
# When prompted to choose "storage on physical hard drive," select "dynamically allocated".
# In the next window: <code>type "WhonixWorkstationFileTransfer" for the drive name</code> &rarr; <code>choose a folder to store the VDI file</code> &rarr; <code>click on the "copy" button</code>. <ref>If copying does not work, power down the old VM and attach the same VDI to the new VM.</ref> 
# After returning to the "Virtual Media Manager" window, click the "close" button.
# In the main VirtualBox window: <code>Click the {{project name}} Workstation version that you want to copy the files into</code> &rarr; <code>click "settings"</code>.
# <code>Navigate to the "storage" section</code> &rarr; <code>click on the square with a + sign</code> &rarr; <code>select "add hard disk" (located next to the "Controller: {{project_name}}" entry)</code>.
# In the next window: <code>Click on "choose existing disk"</code> &rarr; <code>find the saved  "WhonixWorkstationFileTransfer.vdi" file and select it</code>.
# After returning to the "settings" window, click "OK."
# Start the {{project name}} Workstation that you wish to copy your files into. After reaching the desktop, open a Terminal/Konsole session.
# Create a new directory to be the mount point for the drive:{{CodeSelect|code=
mkdir temp
}}
# Mount the new drive: {{CodeSelect|code=
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 temp
}}
# Finally, copy selected files into the {{project name}} Workstation. When copying is finished, shut down the {{project name}} Workstation and delete the temporary "file transfer" VDI files through Virtual Media Manager.

By default, Oracle VirtualBox only supports USB <code>1.1</code>. Additional, closed source extension packs exist for better USB support such as versions <code>2.0</code> and <code>3.0</code>; they can be downloaded from the [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads VirtualBox download page]. Note that improved USB support does <u>not</u> require VirtualBox Guest Additions. It is unclear whether a reboot is required after installation of the extension pack(s); refer to the official VirtualBox documentation for additional information:
* [https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html#intro-installing Installing Oracle VM VirtualBox and Extension Packs]
* [https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch03.html#settings-usb USB Support]

Since [[About#Based_on_Debian|{{project_name}} is based on Debian]], any additional research that is required can utilize search terms like "How to get USB in Linux VirtualBox?". See also: [[Free Support Principle]].

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Adjust the Linux user group.

Otherwise VirtualBox GUI will show <code>no devices available</code>.
</ref> To add the current user to group <code>vboxusers</code>, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo adduser $(whoami) vboxusers

'''2.''' Reboot.

A reboot or re-login is required. 

'''3.''' Plug in the USB device.

USB devices are plugged into Virtual Machines through the device menu in VirtualBox.

'''4.''' Mount the USB device.

Automount of USB devices is disabled in {{project name}} by default. To mount the device, try: <code>Start menu</code> &rarr; <code>System Settings</code> &rarr; <code>Removable Media</code> or manually mount the device. 

Also refer to [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/3b4b67c2/ this old forum topic]. Failures or successes can also be shared in [https://forums.whonix.org a new forum discussion].

'''5.''' ''Optional'': Install the <code>ntfs-3g</code> package.

If the USB device is formatted with NTFS, it is necessary to install the [https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/ntfs-3g ntfs-3g driver package] and run a special mount command, see: [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/c2429909/ Transfer Files from Whonix - USB] and [https://forums.whonix.org/t/can-t-enable-usb-drive-in-virtualbox-troubleshooting-help-needed/1563/7 Can’t enable USB Drive in VirtualBox – troubleshooting help needed].

}}

These instructions assume a connection from a local host into {{project_name}}, not SSH to a remotely running {{project_name}} instance.

{{Box|text=

'''1.''' Adjust {{gateway_product_name}} firewall settings.

{{Firewall Settings Gateway}}

'''2.''' Add.

<pre>

'''4.''' Install <code>openssh-server</code> inside {{gateway_product_name}}.

Make sure this is run on {{gateway_product_name}}! Run the command once.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
}}

'''5.''' Add port forwarding from host into the virtual machine.

Make sure this is run on the host! Run the command once.

Open a terminal. This will forward connections from the host to <code>127.0.0.1:2200</code> to the SSH server running inside {{gateway_product_name}} on port 22.

{{CodeSelect|code=
VBoxManage modifyvm "{{gateway_product_name_short}}" --natpf1 "ssh",tcp,127.0.0.1,2200,,22
}}

If it is necessary to undo this change, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
VBoxManage modifyvm "{{gateway_product_name_short}}" --natpf1 delete "ssh"
}}

To verify the change, run. 

{{CodeSelect|code=
VBoxManage showvminfo "{{gateway_product_name_short}}"
}}

Search for lines beginning with NIC. For example: 
<pre>
NIC 1 Rule(0):   name = ssh, protocol = tcp, host ip = 127.0.0.1, host port = 2222, guest ip = 127.0.0.1, guest port = 22
</pre>

'''6.''' Open a SSH session on the host.

Make sure this is run on the host!

{{CodeSelect|code=
ssh root@127.0.0.1 -p 2200
}}

'''7.''' Create a folder which will be used to mount the image.

Perform this step on the host or mount {{gateway_product_name}} as a folder.

This folder must exist before trying to mount.

== SSH into {{workstation_product_name}} ==

=== Introduction ===

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text    = Developers / experts only! Only for debugging!
}}

These instructions assume a connection from a local host into {{project_name}}, not SSH to a remotely running {{project_name}} instance. The connection formed will look like this: <code>host</code> &rarr; <code>SSH</code> &rarr; <code>{{gateway_product_name}}</code> &rarr; <code>SSH</code> &rarr; <code>{{workstation_product_name}}</code>.

It is not possible to directly SSH into {{workstation_product_name}} because it only has an internal network interface and no NAT interface. Adding a NAT interface would defeat the purpose of {{project_name}}.

=== Prerequisite ===

Do not attempt this procedure before mastering the steps [[#SSH_into_Whonix-Gateway_.E2.84.A2|SSH into {{gateway_product_name}}]].

=== Firewall ===

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Adjust {{workstation_product_name}} firewall settings.

=== Setup Workstation ===

On {{workstation_product_name}}, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=

}}

=== Setup Gateway ===

On {{gateway_product_name}}, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
/usr/bin/ssh.anondist-orig root@10.152.152.11
}}

{{Code|user@}} can also be substituted in the above command.

=== Setup Host ===

Note:
* It is possible to use one command to SSH from the host into {{gateway_product_name}} and then SSH into {{workstation_product_name}}. This is called SSH hopping.
* SSH hopping is also possible for SSHFS; see [http://www.larkinweb.co.uk/computing/mounting_file_systems_over_two_ssh_hops.html here]. <ref>http://www.webcitation.org/6FDYtApEP</ref>
* The filesystem of {{workstation_product_name}} can also be mounted with two commands. 

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' SSH from the host into {{gateway_product_name}}.

<code>host</code> &rarr; <code>{{gateway_product_name}}</code>

{{CodeSelect|code=
ssh -t user@127.0.0.1 -p 2200 "ssh.anondist-orig user@10.152.152.11"
}}

{{Code|root@}} can also be substituted in the above command.

'''2.''' Create a directory to mount {{workstation_product_name}}.

{{CodeSelect|code=
mkdir ~/mountworkstation
}}

'''3.''' SSH into {{workstation_product_name}} and map to localhost:2222.

<code>{{gateway_product_name}}</code> &rarr; <code>{{workstation_product_name}}</code>

Perform this step on the <u>host</u>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
ssh -f user@127.0.0.1 -p 2200 -L 2222:10.152.152.11:22 -N

{{Code|root@}} can also be substituted in the above command.

'''4.''' Mount the {{workstation_product_name}} folder on the <u>host</u>.

{{CodeSelect|code=

Required knowledge:

* This method is not compulsory. Standard ''vdi'' (or ''raw'') images are used, but the user can mount them with another preferred method.
* The mounting and inspecting of images has only been researched for Linux hosts. It may be possible on Windows, but it is undocumented.
* The purpose and use of ''raw'' and ''vdi'' images must be understood, which is explained on the [[Dev/Source Code Intro]] page.
* The {{project name}} source code is required; see chapter [[Dev/Build_Documentation|Build and Update Whonix ™ from Source Code]].
* {{project name}} source code should be verified with OpenPGP, although this is not compulsory.
* Several dependencies are required and can be installed using the {{Code|build-steps.d/1100_prepare-build-machine}} script.

Use this method to mount any VirtualBox file type (VMDK, VDI, VHD, or raw) on a Linux host. It utilizes a VirtualBox utility named "vdfuse" <ref> Broken link: [http://packages.debian.org/wheezy/virtualbox-fuse virtualbox-fuse package]</ref> and the VirtualBox access library to open a VirtualBox supported image file and mount it as a Fuse file system.

{{Box|text=
