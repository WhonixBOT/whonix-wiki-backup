= Why are the Whonix images so big? =

Compared to other "Tor-VM" or "Tor-LiveCD/DVD" projects which sometimes use special minimal or stripped down Linux distributions (e.g. TinyCore, DSL, Puppy) Whonix is larger, both VMs together are currently almost 2 GB.

One reason for that is, that small distributions do not meet our requirements, namely: upstream needs to have a proactive security policy.

* Most "minimal" distributions are small projects that do not have a dedicated security team that audits packages and releases security patches quickly.
* We need a distribution that fully signs updates (this is always desirable but especially so when updating over untrusted exit relays).
* For such distributions security consist in a small attack surface <ref>Our attack surface is still very small, no network listening services, just a few selected applications.</ref>, but that's about it. A full distribution supports MAC, kernel patches, IDS...
* "Big" projects with many users and developers (many eyeballs) are inherently more trustworthy.
* Debian has loads of Security Features, see (Ubuntu article, but mostly true for Debian) [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Features/ Ubuntu Security Features]. Small distributions don't have it.
* See also [[Dev/Operating_System]].

There are maintenance and usability reasons:

* We want to support a wide range of user cases such as hosting hidden services, small distributions usually have limited repositories.
* Whonix, since based on Debian, is a complete operating system. An anonymous general purpose operating system, not a stripped down minimal system. [[Features]], [[Design]]
* Debian has much more documentation than small distributions, also about topics such as Security and Hardening.
* Creating a slim system is difficult and requires a lot of of development time. This should not be Whonix's core competence. There are projects which do not focus on anonymity/privacy/security, but which are dedicated to a slim system.
* Slimming down the system will result in many "strange bugs". People who are used to Debian or Ubuntu will wonder why some things do not work or why Whonix is broken.

Another reason is that Whonix does not play in the anonymity oriented Live CD/DVD market:

Whonix is a new category of anonymity tools. Whonix does not have the requirement to fit on a DVD. (Although in future we may develop a Whonix Live DVD.) While anonymity oriented Live CD/DVD's have to balance between functionality they want to provide available space and security; Whonix, as an anonymous general purpose operating system can by default or optionally provide any functionality and doesn't has to care so much about space. For example, integrating [[Money|Bitcoin]] into Whonix would be, except for documentation, quite simple.

Last but not least reason, not putting security over usability:

* Short: Not putting security over more users.
* Long: For example, this interesting statement from Tor developer Roger Dingledine: [http://www.mail-archive.com/liberationtech@lists.stanford.edu/msg00022.html Mixminion vs Tor]. Similar applies here. Mixminion is a high latency remailer, with cover traffic, protection against traffic confirmation (end-to-end correlation), theoretically more secure than Tor. The problem is "theoretically". They couldn't attract enough users and without enough users it's equally (in)secure as Tor. That's why they decided, to no longer work on Mixminion. Whonix also needs lots of users, to 1) get press/publicity 2) more developers 3) more research and audits. 2 and 3 will result in more security. Creating the most secure and most slim system, would only attract a few geeks. The geeks get hopefully satisfied, because Whonix is highly customizable. Nothing prevents from optionally slimming, hardening and customizing.

= Why is KDE (big) the default desktop environment? Why not use a minimal DE? =
This was a difficult development path decision. Many people, including Patrick Schleizer, didn't like the old Openbox interface in TorBOX (deprecated project name) 0.1.3 because it was too inconvenient, non-intuitive, uncommon, difficult, etc. There is no rational unarguable choice for the best desktop.

MATE has not been chosen, because there are no packages in Debian repositories. GNOME2 is deprecated and only a fraction of GNOME2 users like GNOME3. Other desktops (LXDE, XFCE, Openbox) are less widespread, not so pretty, in in some opinions harder to use (even difficult to create a desktop shortcut), thus not attracting many users.

Choosing KDE is a personal preference by Whonix developer Patrick Schleizer. KDE has one advantage, the only developer likes it and remains interested to maintain and develop Whonix further.

You are free to uninstall KDE and install any other desktop environment of your own choice.

This is a non-ideal situation. Inspired by [https://web.archive.org/web/20140903235102/http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm select your webbrowser], it would be ideal if Whonix would offer to choose which desktop to install but unfortunately, such a wizard [http://lists.debian.org/debian-derivatives/2012/09/msg00003.html does not exist yet]. There are no development resources to implement such a solution. Help is welcome.

If there were contributors, we could maybe also include other desktop environments by default or offer alternative Whonix builds with different default desktop environments or ideally implement a "choose your desktop" option after first boot of Whonix.

Please also read [[#Why are the Whonix images so big?]] above, the same applies here.

See also [[Other Desktop Environments]] for workarounds/alternatives.

= Why not use a Live CD/DVD as Whonix-Workstation operating system? =
We discussed this and came to the decision, that Live CD/DVDs are not suited as Whonix-Workstation.

Positive:

* often actively maintained
* stabilized
* hardened GNU/Linux distribution
* with advanced features.

Negative:

* no timely security updates
* <s>not persistent</s> limited persistence
* not flexible enough

anonymity orientated Live CD/DVD's negative in context of this FAQ:

* anonymity orientated Live CD/DVD's often have their own Tor enforcement included, which would lead into a [[DoNot#Prevent_Tor_over_Tor_scenarios.|Tor over Tor]] scenario

= Why should I (not) trust Whonix? =

See [[Trust]] for a long answer.

= Whonix crashes because of PAE? =

See [[VirtualBox#PAE_crash|PAE crash]].

= You should not waste the Tor network's bandwith by downloading operating system updates over Tor! =

Short answer: We discussed this with torproject.org and were allowed to do so.

Long answer: We had a thread about this issue, [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorBOX/Dev/ArchivedDiscussion/DOCUMENTATION#updatesoverTorshouldnotwasteTorbandwidthDOCUMENTATIONSOLVED updates over Tor, should not waste Tor bandwidth]. Discussed thoroughly. We speculated a lot and thought about solutions until we finally did what we should have done in the first place. We asked torproject.org, see [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-March/023486.html tor-talk Operating system updates / software installation behind Tor Transparent Proxy]. Click [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-March/subject.html#23507 here] for an overview of all answers. Andrew Lewman ([https://www.torproject.org/about/corepeople.html.en Executive Director, Director, press contact]), too, downloads a lot of updates over Tor and [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-March/023493.html did not complain].

= Alpha? Beta? Stable? Development? testers-only? developers-only? Whonix version scheme =
{{Anchor|Alpha? Beta? Stable? Development? Whonix version scheme}}
Is Alpha, Beta or Stable related to security? No, our design makes security issues inherently less likely to occur.

The terms alpha, beta lost their meaning. Too many applications which are working fine for years are called alpha or beta and have version numbers below 1.0. Users are not taking these terms serious anymore. Therefore Whonix avoids these terms. Rather, Whonix uses different terms which mean what they say.

* stable versions
* testers-only versions
* developers-only

= Why do you use the 32 bit operating system, not 64 bit? =
We do not. At least not for all [[Download|supported platforms]].

* [[Qubes-Whonix]]:
** Is 64 bit by default.
** Qubes-Whonix exists to suit recent, compatible hardware.
* [[Non-Qubes-Whonix]]:
** Is 32 bit by default.
** Exists for compatibility. 32bit software runs without problems on 32bit and 64bit hosts. 64bit software not so much. We generally don't control for Non-Qubes-Whonix what host operating system people use. Therefore, 32bit has been chosen as base for official Whonix releases. Secondly, 64bit software needs more RAM, we already run 3 operating systems on a system which, eats RAM. Let's better minimize that. <ref>
[[KVM]] and improves RAM usage through [[KVM#Enabling_HugePages|page sharing]], however as documentation states there are good reasons for not enabling it by default. [[VirtualBox]] does not have such a feature.
</ref>
** [[VirtualBox]]: A critical VirtualBox bug: [https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/10853 VirtualBox ticket #10853: Mouse position repeatedly reset to top and/or left of screen]. - TODO: Still current?
** You can build Whonix [[Dev/Build_Documentation|from source code]] and use <code>--arch amd64</code> as per build documentation to create 64 bit builds.
** If a [[Contribute#Maintainer|maintainer]] steps up to [[Contribute|contribute]] it might be possible in future to have 32 and 64 bit downloads for Non-Qubes-Whonix in future.

= Why aren't you using OpenBSD, it's the most secure OS ever!!!1! =
Last update: 27.07.2014

This FAQ entry answers from perspective of the Whonix distribution to people who suggest to base Whonix on top of OpenBSD instead of Debian.

[http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq1.html#WhyUse source] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6RNq1f996 w])
<blockquote>
OpenBSD is thought of by many security professionals as the most secure UNIX-like operating system, as the result of a never-ending comprehensive source code security audit. 
</blockquote>

Who are those many security professionals?

OpenBSD according to [http://www.bsdstats.org/ bststats.org] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6F4tFWwNy w]) has very few users. 56 at time of writing. People must undergo a rather complicated manual process to get counted, however compared to 24,168 FreeBSD users, that's not very much. If they don't attract the masses, ordinary crackers, hackers and the security research community doesn't get attracted as they do with more popular operating systems. At the same time a targeted attack gets easier, because people who get paid to find exploits can find them more easily.

See [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.os.openbsd.bugs/18754 security vulnerability - NTP not authenticated] [by default for everyone] and it doesn't look like they step forward to fix it. The suggestion was to authenticate the connection to the NTP server, which is not possible for Whonix for many reasons. We need to distribute the trust, not using only one NTP server and we must use free services which are available for anyone and not something requiring an own server. And even if we would use authenticated NTP. @Fled pointed out <ref>https://twitter.com/feldpos/status/493426189282054144</ref>, that the clock can not be moved more than 600 seconds. That is better than nothing - still - an adversary in position to move the clock 600 seconds can harm anonymity/privacy (see [[Dev/TimeSync]] for further explanation).

OpenBSD's website isn't reachable over SSL or as a Tor hidden service. How are users supposed to securely view the OpenBSD site and not learn things set up by a man-in-the-middle?

There is now Qubes OS, OpenBSD lacks such innovative security improvements, which claims.

= Why don't you use FreeBSD, which is more secure?!? =
Last update: 27.07.2014

This FAQ entry answers from perspective of the Whonix distribution to people who suggest to base Whonix on top of FreeBSD instead of Debian.

It is difficult (very time consuming in this case) to prove a negative. Such as proving non-existent security features. Either a search results in "security feature implemented" or nothing.

To avoid getting out of date and hurting other people's feelings, it's better not to make any statements about non-existent security features, but just asking the appropriate questions.

Does FreeBSD have a secure-by-default update mechanism? Will every (new) user download by default from an already existing '''signed''' repository, or are special settings required, or is it required to run an own repository? Does it defend against outdated metadata, can a man-in-the-middle use a roll back or freeze attack against the repository? Does it defend [https://www.cs.arizona.edu/stork/packagemanagersecurity/ this] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6Ev4smCoD w])? Does it cover the [https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/develop/SECURITY.md TUF threat model] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6Ev4owhEP w])?

Not finding anything doesn't mean there isn't something. The best way to get confirmation about the absence of security features or in other words, the best way to get a confirmation about possible attacks due to missing security features is asking the developers of that project. (An honest reply from Open Source projects is assumed.) There are simply too many distributions to ask these things.

So, if you believe that FreeBSD is a secure distribution, if you are even advocating that standpoint, then the burden of proof is on the person making the claim (you). It's up to you to come up with references that these security features are implemented. It is not up to the Whonix developers to spend a lot time, proving that these security features are non-existent. Or it's up to you to create such references by asking the distribution's developers. Another way would be coming up with arguments why these security features are unnecessary (this is unlikely in the specific case of package manager security). Until the claim of being a more secure distribution gets substantiated, please do not take offense by not considering that distribution.

= Why don't you use OpenWRT, which is more secure?!? =
Same reasons as above for FreeBSD.

OpenWRT do not have signed packages.

= How is Whonix different from Tails? =

See [[Comparison with Others]].

= Why don't you merge with Tails and join efforts? =

'''UPDATE 7:''' Rewrite.

'''This is a subjective statement of opinion by Whonix developer Patrick Schleizer.''' (Still open for feedback, corrections, improvements!)

[https://tails.boum.org/ Tails] is a respected project with similar goals (anonymity, privacy and security), which exists for many years and which has multiple developers, experience and a working infrastructure. The Whonix and the Tails developers cooperate to some degree and are discussing things, which are related to the projects on various developers mailing lists, i.e. whonix-devel, tails-devel and secure-os. Parts of Whonix are based on Tails. For example tails_htp was invented by Tails which lead to the development of [https://github.com/Whonix/sdwdate sdwdate]. Whonix also profits from their previous (Debian) upstream efforts (packaging and so on), their old and current discussions, their research, design documents, experience, feedback and so on.

Even though Patrick Schleizer highly values Tails, why is Whonix a separate project and not a contribution to Tails?

Whonix can not be merged into Tails by Patrick Schleizer. There are technical, skill and political reasons.

Patrick Schleizer doesn't/didn't know how to implement various things into Tails, and don't/didn't know when the Tails developers will add them, which are Patrick Schleizer's priorities, but knew how to solve them in a separate project (Whonix), at least as in a way, that users are provided with instructions how to do it. Some examples.

'''Some of these items may already be either partially or fully solved in Tails by now.'''

'''TODO''' Broken since migration to whonix.org. Ignore for now.

Also political and design decisions differ too much.

* As a code contributor to Tails, Patrick Schleizer would have to accept decisions made by the Tails decision making process and couldn't simply modify anything as personally desired, preferred or believed to be the best solution. That's the great thing about Free Software. You are free to disagree and to create a fork. Since Patrick Schleizer motivation was not about a Live DVD and personally found improving Tails much more difficult than starting fresh, a new project, Whonix, was created.
* Source Code Merge Policy:
** Whonix: does not yet have a comprehensive merge policy. It's welcome, but not compulsory to write a design or documentation.
** Tails: In Patrick Schleizer's opinion, [https://tails.boum.org/contribute/merge_policy/ Tails merge policy] is too strict. This is not a complaint or critique. They will have their reasons for that and it has to be noted, that Tails is still doing well and useful for many people. Anyone who does not agree has the freedom to contribute to another project or to start a new project. Patrick Schleizer just made use of that freedom.
* One big difference is, that Tails is a Live DVD and therefore inherits some restrictions and limitations. Tails must fit on a DVD, while Whonix does not have such a requirement. Whonix has higher hardware requirements, but therefore more space to implement features. That means that initially fewer people will be able to use Whonix, but over the years available hardware to people will (hopefully) improve. Whonix is discovering both, theoretically and practically, new designs. Over time, depending on user feedback and general interest, a Live DVD or Live Blu-ray might be created.
* Patrick Schleizer found it easier to cooperate with the security by isolation focused operating system [https://www.qubes-os.org Qubes OS] which resulted in [[Qubes-Whonix]].

= How is Whonix different from the Tor Browser Bundle? =

See [[Comparison with Others]].

= Does this mean that, for example, my IP and location is safe when using Skype? =

This answer has been moved to the [[Voip#Skype|Voip]] page.

= Isn't VirtualBox an insecure choice? =
<u>Update</u>:

[[VirtualBox]] is not the only [[Download|supported platform]]. There is also [[Qubes-Whonix]] and [[KVM|Whonix for KVM / Virt-Manager]]. The primary purpose of Whonix for VirtualBox is to get more users in touch with Free/Libre Software, Open Source, Linux and Tor. To give them a chance to try out Whonix and to learn more.

<u>Old statement</u>:

<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed" style="width:800px">
If you would like to see the old statement, please press on expand on the right.
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
VirtualBox is not an ideal choice, see: [[Dev/Virtualization Platform]].

It's about different goals. Whonix's main goal is to protect the user's IP/location.

At the moment Whonix is practically more secure in many cases, see [[Security in Real World|Whonix Security in Real World]].

Saying VirtualBox is too weak, is theoretical and does not have any practical implications at the moment. What are the alternatives? Continue running Tor and torified applications on the host? Running TBB and running into another [https://blog.torproject.org/blog/firefox-security-bug-proxy-bypass-current-tbbs proxy bypass bug]? People failing to correctly torify software? Software [https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea not honoring proxy settings]?

On the other hand, how many known exploits exist for VirtualBox? What's the track record of exploits?

Admittingly virtual machine exploits may become a problem in future. Right now, Whonix provides more security out of the box. Whonix right now, advertises and educates the security by isolation principle.

Anyone seriously looking into Whonix for security will read the [[Documentation]], the [[Security Guide]] and the [[Advanced Security Guide]] and find out about [[Download|other supported platforms]]. Whonix is an appetizer for the [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/IsolatingProxy Isolating Proxy Concept] and [http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2008/09/three-approaches-to-computer-security.html Security by Isolation].

Many users are still on Windows or Linux. Whonix can right now fill the void and improve real world security. They are better using Whonix, which is up to date, actively maintained and developed than any seriously outdated projects like JanusVM.

Whonix can not serve all target audiences. The more security educated/interested people will use [[Download|other supported platforms]]. Hardcore security educated/interested people will probably build their own custom hardened solutions, but can still profit from Whonix's research and source code. Those more hardened solutions, such as the [[Hardened Gentoo TG|Hardened Gentoo Whonix-Gateway]] are more difficult to use and can therefore not be the default for Whonix.

= Will there be a Whonix Live CD or DVD? =

* [[Qubes-Whonix]]: The most promising mid term possibility may be running [[Qubes-Whonix]] on [https://www.qubes-os.org Qubes OS] Live DVD/USB which is currently in Alpha. Since there is already cooperation between Qubes OS and Whonix, i.e. Qubes-Whonix and since hardware support and Live operating system development is up to the Qubes developers, there is not much that needs to be done on the Whonix side.
* [[Non-Qubes-Whonix]]: Unless someone joins the project and contributes, this won't happen in near future. Whonix developer Patrick Schleizer has limited knowledge about Live CD/DVD creation. At the moment Whonix is a rather simple project. Many things, get delegated to upstream. There are various [[Download|supported platforms]], Debian provides a fine operating system, hardware support is delegated to the host operating system and supported platform, Tor is providing a fine anonymizer. Creating a Live CD /DVD would be difficult, especially the hardware support. Whonix is also too big and that would be very difficult to fix, see [[#Why are the Whonix images so big?]] above. Patrick Schleizer lacks experience about Live CD/DVD deployment.

For an alternative also see the next question below.

= Is there something like Whonix Live? =

Whonix runs fine when the host operating system is installed on external media.

There is a [[Pre_Install_Advice#Recommendation_to_use_a_dedicated_host_operating_system|Recommendation to use a dedicated host operating system]] and a [[Pre_Install_Advice#Recommendation_to_use_Whonix_on_External_Media|Recommendation to use Whonix on External Media]].

It's the user's responsibility to honor that advice.

= Why can't I ping the Whonix-Gateway? =
Whonix-Gateway is firewalled (see ''{{WhonixFirewall}}'' or in Whonix source code) and does not answer to ping (-like) commands for security reasons. In most cases, you don't need to ping the Gateway.

If you really want to ping the Gateway or really want some uber special setup you can test wise clear all firewall rules with the [https://github.com/Whonix/whonix-developer-meta-files/blob/master/dangerous_scripts/dev_clearnet dev_clearnet] script or try [[Dev/Firewall_Unload]] (or hack Whonix's firewall to not load at all). It's only for experts and you need to comment out the ''exit 0'' at the beginning.

= You should add full disk encryption to Whonix! =

'''Short''': No, you should add [[Advanced Security Guide#Full Disk Encryption|Full Disk Encryption]] to your host!

'''Long''': See [[Advanced_Security_Guide#Encrypted_Images|Encrypted Images]].

= Speed up the Whonix-Gateway? Speed up Tor? =

''Is there a way to configure the number of nodes in a circuit and to allow selection according to their speeds?''

Remember, [[Free Support Principle|Whonix is based on Debian,Tor etc.]] It is nothing very special. Therefore Whonix does not limit Tor and your options in any way.

If you learn how to configure Tor in such a way in Debian command line, you also learned how to do it in Whonix-Gateway. While it's possible to learn it yourself and do manually, this is not recommended in Whonix-Gateway since also the Tor developers don't recommend it.

For these reasons there are no instructions in Whonix documentation how to do it. If you find general instructions the only thing changing would be that you do it in Whonix-Gateway instead on the host.

Please also see the next question below.

= Does Whonix modify Tor? =

'''NO!'''

Tor's configuration file has been adapted for Whonix, you can check it on Whonix-Gateway in <code>/etc/tor/torrc</code> and <code>/usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc</code>. (This is done by the [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-gw-anonymizer-config anon-gw-anonymizer-config] package.) There are no patches to Tor. The normal Tor deb package is being used in Whonix, installed from deb.torproject.org.

Whonix tries to be as less special as possible to ease security auditing of Whonix.

Any changes to the Tor routing algorithm should be proposed, discussed and eventually implemented upstream in Tor on torproject.org. And if discussion fails, a Tor fork<ref name=fork>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)</ref> could be created. Tor has already been forked at least once.

Doing such changes directly in Whonix would limit discussions about Whonix to the security of the modified routing algorithm. To allow further exploration of Whonix's security, Whonix developer Patrick Schleizer believes, it is required to be as agnostic as possible about all parts of Whonix.

= Why doesn't Whonix improve Tor? =

Please see the question above.

Creating Whonix is difficult and time consuming enough. Improving Tor is left to the people who are better at this job. Any bugs/suggestions related to torproject.org will of course be reported. [[Dev/Threat Model#Design Document, innovations and research|Happens.]]

= Can you improve Tor? =

No.

Any improvements to Tor should be proposed upstream. If Patrick Schleizer finds a bug or has a suggestion it will be proposed upstream on torproject.org. [[Dev/Threat Model#Design Document, innovations and research|Happens.]]

For reasons why there isn't an improved version of Tor in Whonix see the question [[#Does Whonix modify Tor?]] above.

Anyone unhappy with Tor should provide patches upstream and as last resort fork<ref name=fork /> it. Hypothetically, if the fork<ref name=fork /> gets better respected than the original project, then Whonix will of course seriously consider switching.

= You should disable JavaScript by default! =
No, this isn't a good idea for many reasons.

Whonix is an anonymity distribution gluing together concepts, which are generally respected by educated people and known to work reliably. It's not a browser project trying to create a secure browser such as "Privacy Browser - solves all browser fingerprinting problems". Whonix does not have the manpower to create such a browser. In theory, and even if it had, it would make more sense to create a new project "Privacy Browser" and when it gets better than Tor Browser to use, re-configure Whonix to use "Privacy Browser" instead of Tor Browser.

Whonix also doesn't modify Tor Browser for the same reasons also listed in the already answered questions [[#Does Whonix modify Tor?]], [[#Why doesn't Whonix improve Tor?]] and [[#Can you improve Tor?]] above.

Whonix includes Tor Browser and with only [[Tor Browser#Tor Browser in Whonix differences|minor]] differences.

Mike Perry, developer of Tor Browser has also made a good posting why it's better to have JavaScript enabled in Tor Browser by default, see [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-May/024227.html tor-talk Tor Browser disabling Javascript anonymity set reduction]. In summary to his post, Tor Button and the Tor Browser patches to handle the most serious issues related to JavaScript. There are no IP/location bypass problems. Although there are outstanding issues <ref>[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?keywords=~tbb-fingerprinting tbb-fingerprinting]</ref> <ref>[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?keywords=~tbb-linkability tbb-linkability]</ref>, deactivating JavaScript by default couldn't attract enough users, without enough users the anonymity set will also reduce. When someone deactivates JavaScript it may be even more fingerpintable, depending on how many people disable JavaScript, which no one really knows. Tor Browser contains a [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9387 security slider]. See also The Tor Project's [https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#TBBJavaScriptEnabled JavaScript FAQ]which which states {{Code2|feel free to leave JavaScript on or off depending on your security, anonymity, and usability priorities.}}

Last, but definitively not least, Whonix shares the same [[Fingerprint]] as other Tor Browser Bundle users, which is good for anonymity.

= How difficult is it to develop Whonix? =
This is just Patrick Schleizer's opinion and feeling.

Whonix source code isn't rocket science. In comparison to other things it's very simple.

I think it's best to make a comparison table.

= What is clearnet? =

This term has two meanings.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Connecting to the regular internet not using Tor (or other anonymity networks), and/or</li>
<li>Connecting to regular servers (which are not Tor hidden services) (using Tor or not)</li></ol>

= Can I use DNSCrypt in Whonix? =

Yes, see [[Secondary DNS Resolver]].

= Why not use DNSCrypt as default for Whonix? =

[http://dnscrypt.org/ DNSCrypt] may have good use cases for clearnet. In context of Whonix it's not useful and should not be installed and activated by default for everyone. It does not do what you may think, does not magically solve all DNS related security issues, does not implement end-to-end DNS encryption to the destination server. (That conceptually cannot work. If you knew the IP of the destination server in advance, you wouldn't require DNS in the first place.) The server will still see all DNS requests in cleartext. This is only a short version for the many reasons, why it should not be activated by default for everyone.

More reasons: Tor is about distributing trust. Tor's DNS server change as circuits change, thus trust is distributed. Circuits are stream isolated (for pre-installed applications) and change every ten minutes. As far as I know, there are [https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy/blob/master/dnscrypt-resolvers.csv 27 open resolvers] supporting the protocol.

Public resolvers supporting DNSCrypt have not given reasons to distrust them yet. Even we trusted the people running DNSCrypt servers, their servers would have to be trusted as well and that's not wise to let DNS security for all Whonix users depend on few servers. It's also about load balancing. If Whonix was to use a DNSCrypt supporting server by default and that server decides to forbid connections from the Tor network (due to the Tor network used to abuse their servers with DDOS or for whatever reasons) or if the servers go down for maintenance, DNS would break for all Whonix users.

For even more explanations on DNSCrypt, see forum post [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/3c99944b/ one] and [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/e659f3ad/#bff5 two] related to this topic.

= Can I use DNSCrypt on the host, in my router, for clearnet? =

Yes, if you want. Also read the entry below.

= Does DNSCrypt on the host or in my router, harm anonymity when using Tor/Whonix? =
Short answer: No.

Long answer: No, DNSCrypt on the host or in your router only affects your clearnet activities. Tor assumes your local network and ISP to be totally unsafe and untrustworthy. Neither Tor nor Whonix are affected by DNS settings on your host or in your router.

Whether DNSCrypt is useful for your clearnet activities or not - that isn't clear. There are pro and contra arguments. It's useful when using foreign or untrusted Wifi networks (shared with others), since they could modify and/or read your DNS requests. Other than that, you will just shift the trust from one party (ISP) to another (DNSCrypt supporting DNS server, ex: OpenDNS). If the DNSCrypt supporting DNS server leaks your network address and logs your queries as part of their business, then it might be worse than your ISP. Which one should be trusted more, your ISP or a 3rd party provider - you tell me.

= What's the difference of installing a VPN on the host versus installing on Whonix-Gateway? =
This entry assumes, you already decided to use a VPN.

If you did that after reading the [[Tunnels/Introduction|VPN / Tunnel Support]] documentation, and decided you want to use a VPN, continue reading, otherwise you can skip this FAQ entry.

{{VPN_on_the_host_vs_on_Whonix-Gateway}}

= Does Whonix/Tor protect you from the NSA or other three letter agencies? =
If you are under active surveillance:<br />
Whonix can do nothing against miniature cameras or microphones in your room etc.

If you are under passive surveillance just like anyone ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program) PRISM]):<br />
That depends if Tor protects from such threats. The answer to that is not clear: <br />
https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-July/029014.html

And even if Tor was a whole lot better, you can never prove a negative. So it's better to hesitate to any broad claims as it would be skeptical if any other project claimed that.

Also Whonix does not make such broad claims. For a related statement about three letter agencies, also see:
[[Technical Introduction#With more technical terms]]

= check.torproject.org says "Sorry. You are not using Tor." =
See [[Browser Tests]].

= If I do X - can this leak DNS and/or my real external IP/location? =
Nothing you do inside Whonix-Workstation can cause IP/DNS leaks as long you leave Whonix-Gateway unchanged (besides documented stuff, which goes ok, such as bridges, hidden services, updates).

However, there are still ways you could shoot your own foot. It might be [[DoNot#Do_not_confuse_Anonymity_with_Pseudonymity.|pseudonymous rather than anonymous]], you may de-anonymize yourself by doing [[DoNot|things you should not do]], things like [[Secondary_DNS_Resolver]]s may lead to DNS related identity correlation or the application you are using may be hostile to you, such as in the example of [[Voip#Skype|Skype]].

= Graphical Whonix-Gateway? =
<u>[[Qubes-Whonix]]</u>:<br />
Does not apply.

<u>[[Non-Qubes-Whonix]]</u>:<br />
If you think, it uses too much RAM or generally prefer a terminal version of Whonix-Gateway, you can use reduce Whonix-Gateway's RAM to 192 MB and [[Desktop#RAM_Adjusted_Desktop_Starter|RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter]] will automagically boot into a terminal version of Whonix-Gateway. Note: Whonix 11 Gateway can work with as low as 128 MB RAM, but resource demanding operations like upgrade of kernel packages that need to rebuild the initrd leave the virtual machine in a frozen state.

When using Whonix with [[KVM]], thanks to [https://forums.whonix.org/t/dynamic-memory-management/434 dynamic memory management] the RAM overhead might be a non-issue. By manually enabling these features you may profit from this already today. Eventually at release time of Whonix 10 or above and using [[KVM]], Whonix will enable this by default.

Whonix aims to become as accessible in usability as possible. Sorry, if you're a Linux geek and were happy with the older non-graphical version of Whonix-Gateway <ref>0.5.6</ref>, but you're not the ''only'' target audience. Whonix is also an attempt to get more {{Code2|casual users}}<ref>https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=57532</ref> <ref>See [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPWIA6D5Odg&lc=i9pytdxZ1Z9C1she5VfyQBYWIBXCvH8A80AFs309Cfg linked comment].</ref> using Tor, because {{Code2|the more people use Tor, the better the anonymity Tor can provide becomes}}<ref>
[https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en Quote]:

<blockquote>
[...] Ultimately the best protection is a social approach: the more Tor users there are near you and the more diverse their interests, the less dangerous it will be that you are one of them. Convince other people to use Tor, too!
</blockquote>
</ref>.

In the older non-graphical version of Whonix-Gateway <ref>0.5.6</ref> it was difficult for users who never used Linux before to do tasks such as upgrading or configure obfuscated bridges etc. Many things are simpler and more encouraging in a graphical desktop environment. Such as:

* setting up bridges / flashproxies
* auditing logs
* auditing iptables
* auditing the system architecture in general
* running [[Test]]s
* running [[Dev/Leak_Tests|Leak Tests]]
* editing Tor configuration file {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}
* editing firewall settings folder {{Code2|/etc/whonxi_firewall.d}}
* reading status messages (whonixcheck and timesync)
* changing Tor circuit.
* copying and pasting (configuration) commands, (error) messages and logs
* running tshark / wireshark
* [[FAQ#What.27s_the_difference_of_installing_a_VPN_on_the_host_versus_installing_on_Whonix-Gateway.3F|tunneling only Whonix-Gateway's traffic through a VPN]]

And big black text-only window (terminal) looks scary. A graphical desktop environment is also a prerequisite for further planed improvements, such as a Whonix Controller, which will be a [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/132 graphical Whonix Controller], where you have buttons such as

* "create hidden blog", and then you end up with a preconfigured blog
* "enable TorChat"
* "backup hidden service keys"
* [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/167 Better Circumvention User Interface]
* and so forth.

Also terminal-only environments are often unusable by users with disabilities. That's why recent Whonix versions <ref>Since {{Whonix6}} and above</ref> feature an optional graphical desktop environment.

If you think, the graphical Whonix-Gateway uses too much disk size and/or you want to do non-originally intended things, such as running Whonix completely in RAM, sorry to say. Whonix has never been developed with low size, low RAM or low system requirements in mind. See also [[#Why are the Whonix images so big?]] and [[#Will there be a Whonix Live CD or DVD?]].

Advanced users can build Whonix from source code and use a build configuration to create a terminal-only version of Whonix-Gateway. (Refer to [[Dev/Build Documentation|Build Documentation]] in case that is of interest to you.)

Last but not least, if there was a [[Contribute#Release_Manager|Release Manager]] contributing to The Whonix Project or at least someone willing to build terminal-only versions of Whonix-Gateway (which is not about developing, only about running the build script and uploading), we could easily provide a terminal-only version of Whonix-Gateway. As long very few people are contributing to The Whonix Project, this won't be possible.

See also [[Other Desktop Environments]] for workarounds/alternatives.

= Is there a substitute for Whonix's lack of an Amnesic feature / Live CD/DVD? Forensics? =
'''Short answer''': <br />
No.

'''Long answer''': <br />
[[Warning#Whonix_is_not_amnesic]] and there is no [[#Will there be a Whonix Live CD or DVD?|Live CD/DVD of Whonix.]]

Many people suggested workarounds such shredding Whonix's hard disk images, having a zip archive of Whonix's hard disk images and restoring them every time they are using Whonix, restoring a fresh [[Security_Guide#Recommendation_to_use_multiple_VM_Snapshots|snapshot]] every time they use Whonix, [https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-and-truecrypt/293/6 running Whonix completely in ramdisks], using [[Advanced_Security_Guide#Full_Disk_Encryption|Full Disk Encryption]] and so forth.

These aren't substitutes for having an amnesic system. Not storing sensitive data on hard disks in the first place is much safer than dealing with it after the fact. In that regard, amnesic live systems are superior, because they do exactly this by design.

Never storing data unencrypted in the first place is much safer than trying to wipe it later. Using Full Disk Encryption is very useful. Still, this isn't an applicable stopgap as long as Whonix doesn't offer an amnesic version for every person in all cases. In some areas in the world, having encrypted disks isn't wise.

You should be very cautious about disk forensics claims. We don't know about swap or other strange things operating systems and harddrives are doing nowadays. We are not experts in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_forensics forensics]. Just have a basic understanding of it and know to be cautious. Check out [http://www.infosecisland.com/blogview/12153-Data-Remains-on-USB-and-SSDs-After-Secure-Erase.html Data Remains on USB and SSDs After Secure Erase] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear_leveling wear leveling]. Ordinary hard disks also sometimes mark sectors as bad an never release their data. (?) See also [http://www.forensicswiki.org forensics wiki] to learn some more about the possibilities of forensics.

See also [https://research.torproject.org/techreports/tbb-forensic-analysis-2013-06-28.pdf Forensic Analysis of the Tor Browser Bundle on OS X, Linux, and Windows] to get an idea of what kinds of disk traces may be leftover.

No matter how clever the setup sounds, nothing can beat an amnesic system. At bare minimum, before making any claims:

# Make an image of the hard drive.
# Run Whonix, do some stuff.
# Make again an image of the hard drive.
# Compare the images.

Without performing these basics steps, the setup may sound clever, but may not work out so well against actual forensics. So if you are concerned about local forensics, at bare minimum, use full disk encryption. When established Open Source encryption solutions such as Linux dmcrypt are rightly used, they usually hold their promises. Again, it's not as good as an amnesic system. If being forced to surrender the password is of concern to you, Whonix may not be the right tool for you. Again, without anyone doing actual forensics, be careful with any claims or assumptions how well data may be gone.

= What do you mean by unsupported? =
That means, that this kind of usage [of that package] [outside of Whonix] is undocumented, untested and there is no [[Contribute#Maintainer|maintainer]] that supports this use case. Even if it was just a small effort to support, those many small tasks pile up and there is only so much time. There are simply too many possible variations, too many [https://phabricator.whonix.org/maniphest/query/open/ other tasks on the todo list]. Feel free to experiment with it on your own risk, consider to [[Contribute|contribute]] by becoming a [[Contribute#Maintainer|maintainer]].

= Should I be concerned about... ? =
Whonix is not perfect. There are few volunteers seriously challenging and resolving anonymity, privacy and security issues. The key word is seriously.

{{Should I be concerned}}

Every forum post and support request takes energy from the community. Trivial changes (such as a duplicate deskop icon) are not evidence of a hack or leak. If there is no problem, there is no need for a new post. There isn't enough time to explain every message that Linux reports. Most of those we have no control over and are not important.

= Feedback & Suggestions =
Thank you! Software projects flourish on community feedback. We hear and consider every suggestion.

Please be patient as we address the competing priorities and challenges of our ambitious goal. As Whonix's resources grow, we'll be able to get more done.

= Patches Welcome =
Volunteer contributions are happily considered for review and merge.

We might be able to implement this ourselves, but we have different priorities. Please do not debate priorities as this only contributes of making no progress at all. We might implement this ourselves at some point but it could take a long time. Don't hold your breath. Or we might never implement it.

= Patches Required =
Contributions are happily considered.

We might want to implement this, but we either would require too much time for it or don't know how and seemingly no one else knows either.

= New Identity and Tor circuits =
The behavior of "new identity" in context of TorButton and [[arm]] often misunderstood. First of all, there are various ways to issue a issue a "new identity". Here is a list:

* [[Tor_Browser#New_Identity_Button|Tor Browser - TorButton]]
* [[Tor_Browser#Get_New_Identity_without_Tor_ControlPort_Access|Tor Browser - Get New Identity without Tor ControlPort Access]]
* [[Arm|Arm]]
* [[Tor_Controller#tor-ctrl|tor-ctrl]]
* [[Tor_Controller#netcat|netcat]]
* and probably others

They got one in common. They send a Tor ControPort protocol command "signal newnym" to Tor's ControlPort. Tor circuit lifetimes the result of "signal newnym" is it often misunderstood. "signal newnym" uses a fresh circuit for new connections.

Note, although chances are good that you are getting a new Tor exit relay, a new IP, a new circuit does not guarantee a new Tor exit relay. Tor may only have replaced the middle relay while using the same Tor exit relay. This is by design and Tor default.

"signal newnym" won't interfere with long living connections such as for example an IRC connection.

When you open https://check.torproject.org in your browser, then issue "signal newnym" using [[Arm|Arm]], then reload https://check.torproject.org it may still show the same IP. This is probably because the browser didn't close the connection to https://check.torproject.org in the first place. When you repeat that experiment with a small modification, chances are good you might see a new Tor exit IP. Open https://check.torproject.org in your browser, then issue "signal newnym" using [[Arm|Arm]], then close Tor Browser, then start Tor Browser again. then open https://check.torproject.org again, you might see a new Tor exit relay IP.

Please note, "new identity" in most cases really only means "signal newnym". There are no guarantees about unlinking all sorts of protocol (browser etc.) states so you appear as a different identity. Tor Browser's TorButton New Identity Feature attempts this, but it's not perfect yet, for details see [[Tor_Browser#New_Identity_Button|Tor Browser - TorButton New Identity Feature documentation]].
