{{Anchor|Why aren't you using OpenBSD, it is the most secure OS ever!!!1!}}
== Why isn't OpenBSD Used? ==

This FAQ entry addresses the suggestion that Whonix should be based on OpenBSD rather than Debian. The opinion provided below is based on the perspective of Whonix developers. <ref>Last updated in January 2018.</ref>

The OpenBSD FAQ states: [http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq1.html#WhyUse source] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6RNq1f996 w])
<blockquote>
OpenBSD is thought of by many security professionals as the most secure UNIX-like operating system, as the result of a never-ending comprehensive source code security audit. 
</blockquote>

The landing page for OpenBSD also claims: <ref>https://www.openbsd.org/</ref>

<blockquote>Only two remote holes in the default install, in a heck of a long time!</blockquote>

These contentions are debatable and beg the question, "Who are those ''many'' security professionals and how thoroughly is the code reviewed?".

According to [http://www.bsdstats.org/ bststats.org] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6F4tFWwNy w]), OpenBSD has very few users. Although bdstats is not representative of the total population of OpenBSD users due to the opt-in data collection program, 17 users at the time of writing is a very small figure. By comparison, TrueOS has 9,172 users in early 2018.

If OpenBSD cannot attract a critical mass of users, then ordinary crackers, hackers and the security research community are unlikely to gravitate to the distribution in contrast to more popular operating systems. At the same time targeted attacks become easier, because people who are paid to find exploits can find them more easily. Limited human resources inevitably means the code will remain more vulnerable to security flaws, since they are less likely to be identified.

As an example, see [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.os.openbsd.bugs/18754 security vulnerability - NTP not authenticated]. This six year old bug affects everyone using the distribution, but it does not appear anyone is stepping forward to fix it. The suggested solution was to authenticate the connection to the NTP server, but this would not be possible in Whonix for several reasons. The Whonix design focuses on distributing trust, and not using only one NTP server. Further, Whonix depends on free services which are available to anyone, ruling out  a solution that requires a personal server. Even if Whonix used authenticated NTP, it has been pointed out <ref>https://twitter.com/feldpos/status/493426189282054144</ref> that the clock could not be moved more than 600 seconds. This is better than nothing, but still inadequate for adversaries who are capable of moving the clock more than 600 seconds, harming anonymity/privacy in the process (see [[Dev/TimeSync]] for further details).

In addition, previously the OpenBSD website was not reachable over SSL. <ref>A Tor onion service is still not available.</ref> Therefore, at that time users were unable to securely view the OpenBSD site, since a man-in-the-middle attack would have been trivial to perform.

OpenBSD simply lacks innovative security improvements which are available in modern platforms like Qubes OS, despite their grandiose claims.

== Why isn't FreeBSD Used? ==

This FAQ entry addresses the suggestion that Whonix should be based on FreeBSD rather than Debian. The opinion provided below is based on the perspective of Whonix developers. <ref>Last updated in January 2018.</ref>

It is difficult and time consuming to try and list all the disadvantages of using FreeBSD, such as highlighting non-existent security features. The onus is on FreeBSD proponents to manually search for relevant features (or  lack thereof) and present an objective case for its adoption.

To avoid presenting information that will quickly become out-of-date or that may insult FreeBSD adherents, it is better to avoid definitive security statements and instead ask appropriate questions which might affect the usability, security, anonymity and wide-scale adoption of Whonix. For instance:

* Does FreeBSD have a secure-by-default update mechanism? 
* By default, will every (new) user download come from an existing ''signed'' repository?
** If not, what special settings are required?
** Are users expected to run their own repository?
* Does FreeBSD defend against outdated metadata; for example, can a man-in-the-middle use a roll back or freeze attack against the repository? 
* Does FreeBSD defend against [https://www.cs.arizona.edu/stork/packagemanagersecurity/ various attacks on package managers?] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6Ev4smCoD w]) 
* Does FreeBSD defend against attacks on the software update process by using the [https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/develop/SECURITY.md TUF threat model] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6Ev4owhEP w])?


Research which might provide a strong case for FreeBSD does not exclude the possibility of weaknesses or missing security features. The best way to determine the strength of the platform and its relative resilience is to directly ask the developers of that project. Honest replies can reasonably be expected from vibrant, open source communities.The only problem is, the Linux/BSD ecosystems have hundreds of distributions and it is a daunting prospect to rank their merits in this way.

Ultimately, the burden of proof falls on FreeBSD advocates to prove that it is the most secure distribution available, and not Whonix developers. Properly researched contributions that answer the questions above would be a good start, and possibly approaching FreeBSD developers directly. Alternatively, research into why various aforementioned protections are not necessary to improve security would also be welcomed. Until claims about FreeBSD are substantiated, one should not take offense that it has not already been adopted.

== Why isn't OpenWRT Used? ==

[https://openwrt.org/ OpenWRT] is not used for the same reasons outlined above. Further, in early 2018 OpenWRT [https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/packages does not have signed packages].

== Why isn't SubgraphOS Used? ==

Whonix has taken the decision not to use the [https://subgraph.com/ Subgraph project] for several reasons:

* Basing Whonix on Subgraph would tie our future with the viability of the Subgraph project. It is not ideal to rely on an OS in alpha status, particularly when the Debian alternative is rock solid and has decades of development behind it.

* The plentiful [https://github.com/subgraph/subgraph-os-issues/issues Subgraph bugs] would become Whonix bugs, and developers would depend on Subgraph for fixes.

* Subgraph chose different programming languages (like Golang) that are unfamiliar to lead Whonix developers, making customization or modification very difficult.

* No full source code release to date (early 2018). <ref>https://github.com/subgraph/subgraph-os-issues/issues/153</ref>

* The publicly available software exists in a form that is not easily packaged. This would pose a significant maintenance burden for the Whonix team.

* Arbitrary limitations are in place, such as repository choices. This can of course be changed, but it is an example of wasted effort in patching the base OS to adapt to our vision.

* Subgraph has some [[Comparison_with_Others/SubgraphOS|undesirable feature additions]] that add no value. Whonix cannot benefit from Subgraph's manpower if the goals for the development roadmap are fundamentally different.

* There is no Subgraph meta package that can be installed using [https://github.com/subgraph/subgraph-os-issues/issues/239 "<code>sudo apt-get install subgraph-os</code>" / "<code>debootstrap</code> Subgraph OS"] in order to convert vanilla Debian into Subgraph OS. <ref>Subgraph is a Debian derivative.</ref>

* To date, there has been no cooperation from the Subgraph project developers to correct any of the issues outlined above. 

* Whonix Developer HulaHoop has also noted that Subgraph features totally rely on the GNOME desktop environment. This is undesirable because it is visually unappealing, has an over-simplified interface, and would require any "cloud integration" elements to be removed. Configuring GNOME to approach the specifications already achieved with KDE in Whonix would require a lot of effort. Further, Wayland and Flatpak will inevitably reach KDE in the future.

= Compromise Indicators =

{{Anchor|Should I be concerned about... ?}}
== Am I Compromised? ==

If the user notices trivial changes on their system - such as a duplicate deskop icon - it is not evidence of a hack or leak. Similarly, if warning or error messages appear that are difficult to understand, in most cases there is no need for panic. If something unexpected occurs such as the appearance of a "htaccess file in home directory", or graphical glitches emerge in [[Arm]], then it is more likely a harmless bug and/or usability issue rather than a compromise.

Skilled attackers do not leave such obvious traces of their breach. An infection by tailored malware is more plausible in this scenario, and virtually impossible to detect by reading random messages in system logs. Even [[Computer_Security_Education#Malware|malware]] that is bought off-the-shelf (malware building toolkits) are unlikely to be discovered by cursory inspections. <ref>Interested readers can verify these claims by researching off-the-shelf malware building toolkits. They are dangerous to install for inexperienced users, but there is a wealth of information online such as screenshots and video tutorials.</ref> [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit Rootkit] technology is no doubt a standard feature of the various programs.

Strange files, messages or other system behavior could feasibly relate to an attacker wanting the user to find something. However, the likelihood of this kind of harassment is considered low. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_kiddie Script kiddies] ("skiddies") are unskilled attackers who uses scripts or programs to conduct attacks on computer systems and networks, most often with juvenile outcomes. For example, they might use programs to remotely control poorly-secured Windows desktops, trolling their victims from an open, forced chat window, opening their DVD drive, and so on. It is improbable that skiddies can achieve similar exploits against Linux, Xen or BSD platforms. <ref>It is unclear if script kiddie programs are readily available for attacking non-Windows users.</ref> Sophisticated attackers generally avoid detection, unless the user is perhaps unlucky enough to be a victim of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zersetzung Zersetzung] (a psychological warfare technique).

Every forum post and support request requires time that could otherwise be directed to Whonix development. Unless the user believes there is a serious and credible problem, there is no need for a new post. Developers and the Whonix community at large do not have enough time to explain every message that Linux might report. In most cases, they are not important and outside the control of Whonix developers.

= DNSCrypt =

== Can I Use DNSCrypt in Whonix? ==

DNSCrypt is possible in Whonix; see [[Secondary DNS Resolver]]. <ref>This is not a recommendation to use it.</ref>

== Why not Use DNSCrypt by Default in Whonix? ==

[http://dnscrypt.org/ DNSCrypt] may have good use cases for clearnet activities. However, it is not useful in Whonix and therefore should not be installed and activated by default for everyone. Although some users may have high expectations, DSNCrypt does not magically solve all DNS-related security issues, nor does it implement end-to-end DNS encryption to the destination server. <ref>Conceptually, end-end DNS encryption is illogical. If the IP address of the destination server was known in advance, then DNS would not be required in the first place.</ref> Most important of all, the server will still see all DNS requests in cleartext. <ref>https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/162601/what-are-the-privacy-advantages-of-a-dns-encryption-service-such-as-dnscrypt</ref> 

There are several other reasons why DNSCrypt is not activated by default. Firstly, Tor distributes trust because the DNS server changes as circuits are rotated. For pre-installed applications, circuits are also stream-isolated and change every ten minutes by default. Notably, in early 2018 there are [https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-resolvers/blob/0449410030b784334c53006cf043ccba911fb88b/v1/dnscrypt-resolvers.csv 78 open resolvers] that support the protocol.

Public resolvers supporting DNSCrypt have not yet acted in a way to cause mistrust. However, even if the operators were absolutely trustworthy, complete confidence is also needed in their servers - it is unwise to let the DNS security for all Whonix users depend on a few servers. Another consideration is load balancing. If Whonix relied upon a DNSCrypt supporting server by default, DNS would break for all users if that server ever decided to forbid connections from the Tor network <ref>Due to the Tor network abuse such as DDOS attacks on their servers.</ref> or if the servers went down for maintenance.

For more detailed information about DNSCrypt, refer to these related [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/3c99944b/ forum] [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/e659f3ad/#bff5 posts].

== Can I Use DNSCrypt on the Host or Router for Clearnet? ==

This configuration is possible; read the next section before proceeding.

== Does DNSCrypt on the Host or Router Harm Anonymity when Using Tor/Whonix? ==

The short answer to this question is no. The longer answer is DNSCrypt on the host or in the router only affects clearnet activities. Tor assumes in advance that a user's local network and ISP are completely unsafe and untrustworthy. Tor and Whonix are unaffected by DNS settings that are made on the host or in the router.

It is debatable whether DNSCrypt is useful or not for clearnet activities since there are various pros and cons. It is useful when using foreign or untrusted Wi-Fi networks that are shared with others, since DNS requests could potentially be modified or read. That said, trust is just shifted from the ISP to a DNSCrypt supporting DNS server, such as OpenDNS. If the DNS server supporting DNSCrypt leaks a user's network address and/or logs queries as part of their business model, then it might actually be worse than using the ISP! It is hard to mount an argument for which party is more trustworthy, the ISP or a third party provider.

= Live Operating System =

== Why not Use a Live CD/DVD as the Whonix-Workstation Operating System? ==

This option was previously discussed in depth and it was decided that Live CD/DVDs are not suitable for Whonix-Workstation.

Advantages:

* Often actively maintained.
* Stabilized.
* Hardened GNU/Linux distribution.
* Advanced features.


Disadvantages:

* No timely security updates.
* Limited persistence.
* Inflexible design.


Another serious disadvantage of Live CD/DVDs in the context of an anonymity-oriented OS is that they often have their own method of Tor enforcement included. In Whonix, this would result in a [[DoNot#Prevent_Tor_over_Tor_scenarios.|Tor over Tor]] scenario.

== Will there be a Whonix Live CD or DVD? ==

'''[[Qubes-Whonix]]'''

The most promising mid term possibility may be running [[Qubes-Whonix]] on [https://www.qubes-os.org Qubes OS] Live DVD/USB, which is currently in [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/live-usb/ Alpha]. <ref>See also: https://groups.google.com/forum/?_escaped_fragment_=topic/qubes-users/IQdCEpkooto#!topic/qubes-users/IQdCEpkooto</ref> Unfortunately, at the time of writing Live-mode is no longer supported or maintained by Qubes. <ref>https://www.qubes-os.org/downloads/</ref> Nevertheless, if this is further developed in the future, only limited changes are required on the Whonix side. The primary responsibility for hardware support and Live operating system development rests upon Qubes developers, with whom the Whonix team has a strong, collaborative, working relationship.

'''[[Non-Qubes-Whonix]]'''

This will not be available in the near future unless a developer steps forward, joins the Whonix team, and begins contributing code. Lead Whonix developer Patrick Schleizer has limited knowledge about Live CD/DVD creation and deployment, and completing this project would be difficult, particularly for hardware support. At the moment Whonix is a rather simple project, and many things are delegated upstream. For instance, there are various [[Download|supported platforms]], Debian provides a fine operating system, hardware support is delegated to the host operating system and supported platform, and Tor is providing a world class anonymizer. Another related problem is the [[FAQ#Why_are_Whonix_Images_so_Large.3F|large size of the Whonix images]] at present, making it very difficult to fit neatly on a Live CD/DVD. <ref>This situation might change in future if additional human resources become available. Check this wiki entry at a later date and also read: https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-live-mode</ref>

A workable alternative for testers is outlined in the next section below.

== Is there Something like Whonix Live? ==

Starting with Whonix 14, [[Non-Qubes-Whonix]] users can optionally run Whonix as a [[Whonix_Live|live system]]. Booting into live mode will make all writes go to RAM instead of the hard disk. Everything that is created / changed / downloaded in the VM during that session will not persist after shutdown. This also holds true for malicious changes made by malware, so long as it did not break out of the virtual machine. 

Alternatively, users can follow the recommendations to run Whonix with the [[Pre_Install_Advice#Recommendation_to_use_a_dedicated_host_operating_system|dedicated host operating system]] installed on [[Pre_Install_Advice#Recommendation_to_use_Whonix_on_External_Media|external media]].

= Tor = 

== Why Waste Network Bandwidth by Downloading Operating System Updates over Tor? ==

The short answer is this option was discussed with The Tor Project and Whonix was granted permission to do so.

Interested readers who want to learn more should review the following:

* Tor Project thread about this issue; see [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorBOX/Dev/ArchivedDiscussion/DOCUMENTATION#updatesoverTorshouldnotwasteTorbandwidthDOCUMENTATIONSOLVED updates over Tor, should not waste Tor bandwidth]. 
* The Tor Project was asked directly, after this issue and possible solutions were discussed thoroughly by the Whonix team; see [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-March/023486.html tor-talk Operating system updates / software installation behind Tor Transparent Proxy]. <ref>Click [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-March/subject.html#23507 here] for an overview of all answers.</ref>
* Andrew Lewman, a former Executive Director, Director, and press contact for Tor downloads a lot of updates over Tor and [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-March/023493.html did not complain].

== Can I Speed Up Tor or the Whonix-Gateway? ==

''Is there a way to configure the number of nodes in a circuit and to allow selection according to their speeds?''

{{mbox
| type      = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text       = '''Reminder:''' [[Free Support Principle|Whonix Reliance on Debian (and Tor)]] - ''"Whonix is not a stripped down version of Debian; anything possible in "vanilla" Debian GNU/Linux can be replicated in Whonix."'' Tor configurations are not limited by using Whonix.
}}


Users who already know how to configure Tor in this fashion using the command line in vanilla Debian can follow the same procedure in Whonix-Gateway. This is not an endorsement for making these manual Tor changes because it is not recommended by Tor developers and thus the Whonix team. <ref>Deferring to their expertise on the possible adverse anonymity effects.</ref> This is also the reason there are no instructions in the Whonix documentation to manipulate Tor nodes in this way. 

That said, if general instructions were found describing how to achieve this on the host, then the same procedure could simply be repeated in Whonix-Gateway.

== Does Whonix Modify Tor? ==

{{mbox
| type      = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text       = Whonix does <u>not </u> modify the Tor package itself.
}}


Although Whonix does not modify Tor, the configuration file ''has'' been adapted for Whonix. To inspect the relevant files, check both <code>/etc/tor/torrc</code> and <code>/usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc</code> on Whonix-Gateway. <ref>Changes to the configuration file are made by the [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-gw-anonymizer-config anon-gw-anonymizer-config] package.</ref> Tor is not patched and the normal Tor deb package is used in Whonix. This is installed from either deb.torproject.org, or sdscoq7snqtznauu.onion if the user has  [[Security_Guide#Tor_Versioning|"onionized" Tor Project updates]].

Any changes to the Tor routing algorithm should be proposed, discussed and eventually implemented upstream in Tor on torproject.org. <ref>This means changes occur for all Tor users, and not a subset relying on a particular distribution.</ref> If proposed changes are not adopted by The Tor Project, then the option to create a Tor fork <ref name=fork>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)</ref> is available. Tor has already been forked at least once.

A general Whonix design principle is to keep the Tor process as uniform as possible, in order to simplify any security audits. Diverging from this practice would introduce unnecessary complexity, possibly worsen fingerprinting or degrade anonymity, and limit Whonix discussions to the security impacts of the modified routing algorithm. For these reasons, the Whonix team is strongly disinclined to make any direct changes to the Tor package.

== Can Whonix Improve Tor? ==

As outlined in the [[#Does Whonix modify Tor?|previous section]], Whonix will not implement any changes to Tor directly and any suggested improvements or bug fixes are proposed upstream on torproject.org. This already [[Dev/Threat Model#Design Document, innovations and research|happens]] on occasion. Creating Whonix is a difficult and time consuming endeavor, so Tor improvements are better left to dedicated, skilled developers who are more knowledgeable in this area. 

Skilled coders can always provide upstream patches to Tor, or as a last resort, fork <ref name=fork /> it. Hypothetically, if a fork <ref name=fork /> developed a greater following than the original project due to proven security / anonymity benefits, then Whonix would seriously consider making a switch.

== What is Clearnet? ==

This term has two meanings:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Connecting to the regular Internet without the use of Tor or other anonymity networks; and/or</li>
<li>Connecting to regular servers which are not onion services, irrespective of whether Tor is used or not.</li></ol>

== check.torproject.org says "Sorry. You are not using Tor." ==

See [[Browser Tests]].

== New Identity and Tor Circuits ==

The behavior of "New Identity" in the context of TorButton and [[arm|Arm]] is often misunderstood. First of all, there are various ways to issue a issue a "New Identity":

* [[Tor_Browser#New_Identity_Button|Tor Browser - TorButton]].
* [[Arm|Arm]].
* [[Tor_Controller#tor-ctrl|tor-ctrl]].
* [[Tor_Controller#netcat|netcat]].
* And probably other methods.


In all cases, the "New Identity" function sends the protocol command "signal newnym" to Tor's ControlPort. This clears the browser state, closes tabs, and obtains a fresh Tor circuit for future requests. <ref>https://blog.torproject.org/blog/torbutton-141-released</ref> 

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text       = '''Warning:''' The New Identity feature will ''likely'' create a new circuit with a different Tor exit relay and IP address, but this is not guaranteed.
}}


The impact of "signal newnym" on Tor circuit lifetimes is often misunderstood. "signal newnym" uses a fresh circuit for ''new'' connections. Sometimes Tor only replaces the middle relay while using the same Tor exit relay. This is by design and the Tor default. Further, "signal newnym" does not interfere with long-lived connections like an IRC connection.

Interested readers can verify the effect of "signal newnym" as follows:

# Open https://check.torproject.org in Tor Browser.
# Issue "signal newnym" using [[Arm|Arm]].
# Reload https://check.torproject.org. 
# In some cases it will still show the same IP address, probably because the browser did not close the connection to https://check.torproject.org in the first place.


Now repeat this experiment with a small modification which should result in a new Tor exit IP address:

# Open https://check.torproject.org in Tor Browser.
# Issue "signal newnym" using [[Arm|Arm]].
# Close Tor Browser, then restart it. 
# Open https://check.torproject.org again, and a new Tor exit relay IP address is (likely) visible.


New Identity is not yet perfect and there are open bugs; this is not a Whonix-specific issue. "signal newnym" is not a guaranteed method of unlinking various protocol states (like the browser) so the user absolutely appears to be a different identity. {{Browser_Fingerprinting_Footnote}} Tor Browser's TorButton [[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#New_Identity_Design|New Identity feature]] attempts this, but it is not yet perfect.

In general for greater security, it is better to completely close Tor Browser and restart it. In [[Qubes-Whonix]], the safest option is using a Whonix-Workstation [[Qubes/DisposableVM]] and closing it and recreating a new one after critical activities.

= Trust =

See [[Trust]] for a long answer.

= User Support and Input =

== Feedback and Suggestions ==

The Whonix project is highly receptive to genuine feedback and suggested improvements from users. Software projects flourish from community input, and every suggestion is noted and considered.

The Whonix community is asked to remain patient. The development cycle involves a number of competing priorities and challenges which must be overcome to achieve ambitious roadmap goals. Further, there is also an existing [https://phabricator.whonix.org backlog] of unresolved bugs and feature requests to address.

As Whonix resources grow over time, development activity and responsiveness to user input will increase in kind.

{{Template:Unsupported}}

= Virtualizers =

== Is VirtualBox an Insecure Choice? ==

<u>Update</u>:

Although [[VirtualBox]] is [[Dev/Virtualization Platform|not an ideal choice]], fortunately other platforms are [[Download|supported]]:

* [[Qubes-Whonix]].
* [[KVM|Whonix for KVM / Virt-Manager]]. 


For greater security, users with suitable hardware and sufficient skill are already recommended to  [[Security_Guide#Type_1_vs_Type_2_Hypervisors|prefer Qubes-Whonix]] (a bare-metal hypervisor) over Type 2 hypervisors like VirtualBox and KVM.

The primary reason Whonix supports VirtualBox is because it is a familiar, cross-platform virtualizer which can attract more users to open source (free/Libre) software, Tor, and Linux in general. By remaining highly accessible, Whonix: 

* Increases the scope of potential growth in the userbase.
* Attracts greater attention as a suitable anonymity-focused operation system.
* Increases the likelihood of additional human resources and monetary contributions.
* Allows novice users to easily test Whonix and learn more about security and anonymity practices.
* Improves the relative security and anonymity of Tor / Tor Browser users by offering a virtualized solution.

'''Whonx in VirtualBox vs Tor / Tor Browser / Torified Applications on the Host'''

It is recognized that VirtualBox is not an ideal choice; see [[Dev/Virtualization Platform]]. However, there are different goals to bear in mind - Whonix is primarily focused on protecting a user's IP address / location.

A common refrain of critics is that VirtualBox is "too weak". This is a theoretical concern and does not have any practical implications at present, since Whonix in VirtualBox is actually more secure than running Tor, Tor Browser or torified applications on the host in many cases; see [[Security in Real World|Whonix Security in the Real World]]. 

It must be remembered that there are no alternatives for a large segment of the population who do not have sufficiently powerful hardware to run [[Qubes-Whonix]], or who are technically incapable of running [[KVM]]. In this case, it is safer for them to run Whonix in VirtualBox, rather than continuing to utilize Tor on the host. For example, Whonix helps to protect against future [https://blog.torproject.org/blog/firefox-security-bug-proxy-bypass-current-tbbs proxy bypass bugs] or software which [https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea does not honor proxy settings].

The strength of Whonix and virtualization in general is adherence to the security by isolation principle. VirtualBox critics need to objectively consider how many exploits currently exist for VirtualBox and the track record of exploits. Admittedly, virtual machine exploits may become far more problematic in the future, but at present Whonix is considered to provide more security out of the box running in VirtualBox, than not.
 
'''Platforms with Improved Security'''

Anybody seriously considering Whonix for improved security should refer to the [[Documentation]], particularly the [[Security Guide]], [[Advanced Security Guide]] and available [[Download|supported platforms]] other than VirtualBox. Whonix is a poster child for the [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/IsolatingProxy Isolating Proxy Concept] and [http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2008/09/three-approaches-to-computer-security.html Security by Isolation].

Many users still default to running Tor on their Windows or Linux host. Whonix is immediately available to this cohort to substantially improve their real world security. Indeed, Whonix is the only up-to-date OS designed to be run inside a VM and paired with Tor, which is actively maintained and developed. Other similar projects like [http://www.janusvm.com/tor_vm/ JanusVM] are seriously outdated and no longer actively maintained. <ref>In response to whether JanusVM was safe to use, Roger Dingledine of The Tor Project [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2011-December/022446.html stated in 2011]: "No, not safe. Probably has been unsafe to use for years."</ref>

Whonix cannot serve all target audiences. Users seeking a higher security solution will prefer [[Download|other supported platforms]], like [[Qubes-Whonix]]. "Hardcore" users may prefer to build their own custom hardened solutions, while still profiting from Whonix's research and source code. Hardened solutions like the [[Hardened Gentoo TG|Hardened Gentoo Whonix-Gateway]] are more difficult to use and therefore cannot be set as the default installation for Whonix.

=== Why Use a 32-bit Operating System Instead of 64-bit? ===

'''Whonix 13'''

Whonix does not uniformly use a 32-bit operating system; it is dependent on the [[Download|supported platform]] in use. In the current stable release:

* [[Qubes-Whonix]] is 64-bit by default, since Qubes is aimed at users with modern, compatible hardware.
* [[Non-Qubes-Whonix]] is 32-bit by default.


Until now, the decision to support a 32-bit build for [[Non-Qubes-Whonix]] has primarily related to compatibility. 32-bit software runs on both 32-bit and 64-bit hosts, while 64-bit builds cannot be created or used if running a 32 bit kernel. <ref>https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Template:Build_Documentation_64bit</ref> Further, 64-bit software is more memory (RAM) intensive, which could be problematic for running 3 operating systems on older systems (Whonix-Gateway, Whonix-Workstation, and the host OS). <ref>
[[KVM]] improves RAM usage through [[KVM#Enabling_HugePages|page sharing]], however the documentation states there are good reasons for not enabling it by default. [[VirtualBox]] does not have a similar feature.
</ref> However, this does not prevent advanced users from building Whonix [[Dev/Build_Documentation|from source code]] and using <code>--arch amd64</code> as per the build documentation to create 64-bit builds.

'''Whonix 14'''

In Whonix 14, slated for release in early 2018, only 64-bit builds will be available for download across all platforms. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T91</ref> This decision is based on several factors:

* Distributions are increasingly dropping support for 32-bit systems (including Debian). <ref>https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Debian-686-For-i386-CPUs</ref>
* Only a small minority of users are stuck with older hardware that will not support 64-bit builds. <ref>For example, in [https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/8183 Tails], less than 10% of users had 32-bit kernels in late 2016.</ref>
* It is a significant maintenance burden for Whonix to maintain both 32-bit and 64-bit builds for [[Non-Qubes-Whonix]]. That is, Whonix would need to [[Dev/64bit#Current_Situation|maintain 10 images]], instead of the current 6 images.
* Non-Qubes-Whonix users who rely on 32-bit (i686) hardware will still be able to use Whonix 14, by using the  [[Upgrading_Whonix_13_to_Whonix_14|upgrade instructions]] instead of downloading new images. <ref>This is because none of the Whonix packages were made 64-bit only.</ref> <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T688#13700</ref> <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/state-of-offical-64-bit-builds/399</ref>


If a [[Contribute#Maintainer|maintainer]] steps up to [[Contribute|contribute]], it may be possible to have both 32 and 64-bit downloads for Non-Qubes-Whonix in the future.

=== How is Whonix Different from Tails? ===

See [[Comparison with Others]].

=== Why not Merge with Tails and Collaborate? ===

The following is a ''subjective'' opinion by lead Whonix developer Patrick Schleizer. <ref>Last updated in January 2018.</ref> Feedback, corrections, and suggested improvements are welcome.

[https://tails.boum.org/ Tails] is a respected project with similar goals to Whonix - improved anonymity, privacy and security. Tails has existed for many years and has multiple developers, significant experience and a complete working infrastructure. Whonix and Tails developers already cooperate to some degree and discuss things of mutual interest to both projects on various developers mailing lists like whonix-devel, tails-devel and secure-os. 

'''Whonix and Tails Collaboration'''

Several parts of Whonix are based on Tails. For example, the development of [[sdwdate]] in Whonix was reliant  upon Tail's invention of tails_htp. Whonix also profits from Tails' previous efforts to upstream packaging and other changes in Debian, current and historical discussions in various forums, Tails research, design documents, experience, feedback and so on.

Other examples of Tails and Whonix cooperation include:

* [[Dev/Control_Port_Filter_Proxy#onion-grater_by_Tails|onion-grater]] - a whitelisting filter for dangerous Tor control protocol commands - was developed by Tails developer {{Code2|anonym}} with Whonix in mind. Whonix then [[Dev/Control_Port_Filter_Proxy#onion-grater_by_Tails_forked_by_Whonix|forked the Python code]] to add a few necessary improvements. <ref>https://github.com/Whonix/onion-grater</ref>
* Tails has expressed interest in using [[Anon Connection Wizard]] in the future.
<br />
'''Why Whonix is a Separate Project'''

Even though Tails is highly valued by Whonix developers, it may not be clear to the reader why Whonix remains a separate project and not just a contributor to Tails. There are several reasons for this decision: Whonix cannot be merged into Tails by the Whonix team on technical, skill and political grounds; implementing features or changes in Tails is an unfamiliar process; and it is unknown when/if Whonix priorities will be implemented in Tails - but it is known how to solve these in a separate project (at least with appropriate user documentation).

Further examples are outlined in the table below. Note that some of these items may already be partially or fully solved in Tails, but it is has been kept to justify the decision at that time not to merge with Tails.

'''Political and Design Considerations'''

There are also significant differences in political and design decisions which prohibit a merger:

* As a code contributor to Tails, Patrick Schleizer would need to accept decisions made via internal Tails decision-making processes. Whonix would lose the autonomy to simply modify anything in line with personal preferences or favored solutions. <ref>One major advantage of free software is developers are free to disagree about a project's direction, leading to the creation of a fork.</ref> At the time Whonix was created, Patrick Schleizer did not favor a Live DVD/USB approach and personally found improving Tails to be far more difficult than starting a fresh project.
* Source Code Merge Policy:
** <u>Whonix:</u> A comprehensive merge policy has not yet been developed. This would be ideal, but it is not compulsory to formulate such a design or associated documentation.
** <u>Tails:</u> In Patrick Schleizer's opinion, the [https://tails.boum.org/contribute/merge_policy/ Tails merge policy] is too strict. This is not a complaint or critique. No doubt there are good reasons for that decision, and it should be noted that Tails is still a popular and effective solution for many users. Anyone who does not agree has the freedom to contribute to another project or to start a new project, leading Patrick Schleizer to make use of that freedom.
* Another major design difference is Tails' reliance on a Live DVD/USB which inherits some restrictions and limitations. Tails must fit on a DVD/USB, while Whonix does not have this requirement. Whonix also has higher hardware requirements, but therefore more space to implement features. As a consequence, initially fewer people are able to use Whonix, but this situation will improve in the future as available hardware improves. The Whonix design is fluid and new designs (both theoretical and practical) are being discovered over time. Depending on user feedback and general interest, eventually a Live DVD or Blu-ray might be created in Whonix.
* Patrick Schleizer has found it easier to cooperate with the security by isolation focused operating system [https://www.qubes-os.org Qubes OS], which resulted in [[Qubes-Whonix]].

=== How Difficult is Whonix Development? ===

The following information is an opinion expressed by lead developer Patrick Schleizer, which is based on several years of Whonix development and [[Priority_Support|related activities]].

Consider the following comparison table. Whonix source code is relatively simple when compared with activities like the development of cryptographic algorithms and hand written binary code.

</pre>

== Images ==

=== Why are Whonix Images so Large? ===

Compared to other "Tor-VM" or "Tor-LiveCD/DVD" projects which sometimes use special minimal or stripped down Linux distributions (e.g. TinyCore, DSL, Puppy) Whonix is larger, both VMs together are currently almost 2 GB.

One reason for that is, that small distributions do not meet our requirements, namely: upstream needs to have a proactive security policy.

* Most "minimal" distributions are small projects that do not have a dedicated security team that audits packages and releases security patches quickly.
* We need a distribution that fully signs updates (this is always desirable but especially so when updating over untrusted exit relays).
* For such distributions security consist in a small attack surface <ref>Our attack surface is still very small, no network listening services, just a few selected applications.</ref>, but that's about it. A full distribution supports MAC, kernel patches, IDS...
* "Big" projects with many users and developers (many eyeballs) are inherently more trustworthy.
* Debian has loads of Security Features, see (Ubuntu article, but mostly true for Debian) [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Features/ Ubuntu Security Features]. Small distributions don't have it.
* See also [[Dev/Operating_System]].

There are maintenance and usability reasons:

* We want to support a wide range of user cases such as hosting hidden services, small distributions usually have limited repositories.
* Whonix, since based on Debian, is a complete operating system. An anonymous general purpose operating system, not a stripped down minimal system. [[Features]], [[Design]]
* Debian has much more documentation than small distributions, also about topics such as Security and Hardening.
* Creating a slim system is difficult and requires a lot of of development time. This should not be Whonix's core competence. There are projects which do not focus on anonymity/privacy/security, but which are dedicated to a slim system.
* Slimming down the system will result in many "strange bugs". People who are used to Debian or Ubuntu will wonder why some things do not work or why Whonix is broken.

Another reason is that Whonix does not play in the anonymity oriented Live CD/DVD market:

Whonix is a new category of anonymity tools. Whonix does not have the requirement to fit on a DVD. (Although in future we may develop a Whonix Live DVD.) While anonymity oriented Live CD/DVD's have to balance between functionality they want to provide available space and security; Whonix, as an anonymous general purpose operating system can by default or optionally provide any functionality and doesn't has to care so much about space. For example, integrating [[Money|Bitcoin]] into Whonix would be, except for documentation, quite simple.

Last but not least reason, not putting security over usability:

* Short: Not putting security over more users.
* Long: For example, this interesting statement from Tor developer Roger Dingledine: [http://www.mail-archive.com/liberationtech@lists.stanford.edu/msg00022.html Mixminion vs Tor]. Similar applies here. Mixminion is a high latency remailer, with cover traffic, protection against traffic confirmation (end-to-end correlation), theoretically more secure than Tor. The problem is "theoretically". They couldn't attract enough users and without enough users it is equally (in)secure as Tor. That's why they decided, to no longer work on Mixminion. Whonix also needs lots of users, to 1) get press/publicity 2) more developers 3) more research and audits. 2 and 3 will result in more security. Creating the most secure and most slim system, would only attract a few geeks. The geeks get hopefully satisfied, because Whonix is highly customizable. Nothing prevents from optionally slimming, hardening and customizing.

== Patches ==

=== Patches are Welcome ===

Volunteer contributions to Whonix are most welcome. All proposed patches are carefully reviewed and merged if appropriate. Volunteers with the requisite coding ability should refer to the current backlog of [https://phabricator.whonix.org open Whonix issues] and consult with developers before undertaking any significant body of work.

Often, proposed improvements or fixes to the Whonix platform have not yet implemented due to differing developer priorities, limited human resources, and/or the inordinate amount of time required to develop a particular feature or solution. In a minority of cases, the Whonix team is unsure how to resolve a bug, or how to implement a specific change / feature. <ref>Some of these relate to cross-platform problems which are not Whonix-specific.</ref>

It is generally unhelpful to debate the priorities laid out in the future Whonix roadmap, as this diverts energy from core development. Some major suggestions like the availability of a Live Whonix CD/DVD might become available in the long-term, or might never eventuate.

== Security ==

=== Does Whonix Guarantee my IP Address and Location are Safe when Using Skype? ===

This answer has been moved to the [[Voip#Skype|VoIP]] page.

=== Full Disk Encryption Should be Added to Whonix! ===

This assumption is incorrect. In short, it is more effective to add [[Advanced Security Guide#Full Disk Encryption|Full Disk Encryption]] to the host to protect against theft or robbery of personal information or data.

The interested reader can refer to [[Advanced_Security_Guide#Encrypted_Guest_Images|Encrypted Guest Images]] for further details.

=== You Should Disable JavaScript by Default! ===

Whonix has not changed default JavaScript settings in Tor Browser for several reasons:

* Whonix is not a "secure browser" project - the focus is on creating a stable, reliable anonymity distribution which aligns with best practice security and privacy principles, informed by educated researchers in the field.
* Possible fingerprinting or security issues with default settings in Tor Browser are the domain of core Tor developers.
* Whonix has limited manpower, meaning the resources do not exist to create a more secure browser, even if it was desirable. <ref>Even if the manpower existed, it would make more sense to establish a new "Privacy Browser" project, rather than merge its development with Whonix. At a later stage, the theoretically more secure browser could then be bundled with the Whonix platform.</ref>
* Tor Browser is not significantly modified for the same reasons Whonix does not [[#Does_Whonix_Modify_Tor.3F|modify]] or attempt to [[FAQ#Can_Whonix_Improve_Tor.3F|improve]] Tor. <ref>Whonix includes Tor Browser by default, with only [[Tor_Browser#Whonix_Tor_Browser_Differences|minor]] differences.</ref>
* Having Whonix share the [[Fingerprint|fingerprint]] of other Tor Browser users is good for anonymity.


As noted in the [[Tor_Browser#Security_vs_Usability_Trade-off|Tor Browser chapter]], disabling JavaScript by default may worsen fingerprinting:

<blockquote>
The take-home message is disabling all JavaScript with white-list based, pre-emptive script-blocking may better protect against vulnerabilities (many attacks are based on scripting), but it reduces usability on many sites and acts as a fingerprinting mechanism based on the select sites where it is enabled. On the other hand, allowing JavaScript by default increases usability and the risk of exploitation, but the user also has a fingerprint more in common with the larger pool of users.
</blockquote>

Experienced Tor developer Mike Perry has provided justification for enabling JavaScript by default in a tor-talk mailing list topic; see [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-May/024227.html "Tor Browser disabling Javascript anonymity set reduction"]. In summary, Tor Button and Tor Browser patches handle the most serious JavaScript concerns, such as IP address / location bypass problems. <ref>Although there are unresolved [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?keywords=~tbb-fingerprinting tbb-fingerprinting] and [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?keywords=~tbb-linkability tbb-linkability] issues.</ref>

Due to the loss in functionality, disabling JavaScript by default might place Whonix users in a potentially small subset of the Tor Browser population. Logically this risks ''reducing'' the anonymity set because the JavaScript behavior of the Tor Browser population is an open research question. Users should remember that the degree of fingerprinting that is possible will also rely on Tor Browser's [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9387 security] [[Tor_Browser#Security_Slider|slider]] settings. Ultimately the user is free to turn JavaScript on or off, depending on their [https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#TBBJavaScriptEnabled JavaScript security, anonymity and usability preferences].

=== Does Whonix / Tor Provide Protection from Advanced Adversaries? ===

If you are under active surveillance:<br />
Whonix can do nothing against miniature cameras or microphones in your room etc.

If you are under passive surveillance just like anyone ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program) PRISM]):<br />
That depends if Tor protects from such threats. The answer to that is not clear: <br />
https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-July/029014.html

And even if Tor was a whole lot better, you can never prove a negative. So it is better to hesitate to any broad claims as it would be skeptical if any other project claimed that.

Also Whonix does not make such broad claims. For a related statement about advanced adversaries, also see:
[[Technical Introduction#With more technical terms]]

=== Can Certain Activities Leak DNS and/or the Real External IP Address / Location? ===

Nothing you do inside Whonix-Workstation can cause IP/DNS leaks as long you leave Whonix-Gateway unchanged (besides documented stuff, which goes ok, such as bridges, hidden services, updates).

However, there are still ways you could shoot your own foot. It might be [[DoNot#Do_not_confuse_Anonymity_with_Pseudonymity.|pseudonymous rather than anonymous]], you may de-anonymize yourself by doing [[DoNot|things you should not do]], things like [[Secondary_DNS_Resolver]]s may lead to DNS related identity correlation or the application you are using may be hostile to you, such as in the example of [[Voip#Skype|Skype]].

=== Is there a Whonix Amnesic Feature / Live CD / Live DVD? What about Forensics? ===

'''Short answer''': <br />
No.

'''Long answer''': <br />
[[Warning#Whonix_is_not_amnesic]] and there is no [[#Will there be a Whonix Live CD or DVD?|Live CD/DVD of Whonix.]]

Many people suggested workarounds such shredding Whonix's hard disk images, having a zip archive of Whonix's hard disk images and restoring them every time they are using Whonix, restoring a fresh [[Security_Guide#Recommendation_to_use_multiple_VM_Snapshots|snapshot]] every time they use Whonix, [https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-and-truecrypt/293/6 running Whonix completely in ramdisks], using [[Advanced_Security_Guide#Full_Disk_Encryption|Full Disk Encryption]] and so forth.

These aren't substitutes for having an amnesic system. Not storing sensitive data on hard disks in the first place is much safer than dealing with it after the fact. In that regard, amnesic live systems are superior, because they do exactly this by design.

Never storing data unencrypted in the first place is much safer than trying to wipe it later. Using Full Disk Encryption is very useful. Still, this is not an applicable stopgap as long as Whonix doesn't offer an amnesic version for every person in all cases. In some areas in the world, having encrypted disks is not wise.

You should be very cautious about disk forensics claims. We don't know about swap or other strange things operating systems and harddrives are doing nowadays. We are not experts in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_forensics forensics]. Just have a basic understanding of it and know to be cautious. Check out [http://www.infosecisland.com/blogview/12153-Data-Remains-on-USB-and-SSDs-After-Secure-Erase.html Data Remains on USB and SSDs After Secure Erase] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear_leveling wear leveling]. Ordinary hard disks also sometimes mark sectors as bad an never release their data. (?) See also [http://www.forensicswiki.org forensics wiki] to learn some more about the possibilities of forensics.

See also [https://research.torproject.org/techreports/tbb-forensic-analysis-2013-06-28.pdf Forensic Analysis of the Tor Browser Bundle on OS X, Linux, and Windows] to get an idea of what kinds of disk traces may be leftover.

No matter how clever the setup sounds, nothing can beat an amnesic system. At bare minimum, before making any claims:

# Make an image of the hard drive.
# Run Whonix, do some stuff.
# Make again an image of the hard drive.
# Compare the images.

Without performing these basics steps, the setup may sound clever, but may not work out so well against actual forensics. So if you are concerned about local forensics, at bare minimum, use full disk encryption. When established Open Source encryption solutions such as Linux dmcrypt are rightly used, they usually hold their promises. Again, it is not as good as an amnesic system. If being forced to surrender the password is of concern to you, Whonix may not be the right tool for you. Again, without anyone doing actual forensics, be careful with any claims or assumptions how well data may be gone.

== Stability ==

=== Whonix Crashes because of PAE? ===

See [[VirtualBox#PAE_crash|PAE crash]].

== Versioning ==

=== What is the Difference between Alpha, Beta, Stable, Development, testers-only, developers-only? ===
{{Anchor|Alpha? Beta? Stable? Development? Whonix version scheme}}
Is Alpha, Beta or Stable related to security? No, our design makes security issues inherently less likely to occur.

The terms alpha, beta lost their meaning. Too many applications which are working fine for years are called alpha or beta and have version numbers below 1.0. Users are not taking these terms serious anymore. Therefore Whonix avoids these terms. Rather, Whonix uses different terms which mean what they say.

* stable versions
* testers-only versions
* developers-only

== Whonix Gateway ==

=== Why can't I Ping the Whonix-Gateway? ===

Whonix-Gateway is firewalled (see ''{{WhonixFirewall}}'' or in Whonix source code) and does not answer to ping (-like) commands for security reasons. In most cases, you don't need to ping the Gateway.

If you really want to ping the Gateway or really want some uber special setup you can test wise clear all firewall rules with the [https://github.com/Whonix/whonix-developer-meta-files/blob/master/dangerous_scripts/dev_clearnet dev_clearnet] script or try [[Dev/Firewall_Unload]] (or hack Whonix's firewall to not load at all). It is only for experts and you need to comment out the ''exit 0'' at the beginning.

=== Graphical Whonix-Gateway? ===

<u>[[Qubes-Whonix]]</u>:<br />
Does not apply.

<u>[[Non-Qubes-Whonix]]</u>:<br />
{{mbox
| type      = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text       = Whonix-Gateway can work with as little as 256 MB RAM.
}}


If a user believes the Whonix-Gateway is using too much RAM or generally prefers a terminal version of Whonix-Gateway, the allocated RAM can be reduced to 256 MB and [[Desktop#RAM_Adjusted_Desktop_Starter|RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter]] will automatically boot into a terminal version of Whonix-Gateway. 

When Whonix is used in combination with [[KVM]], [https://forums.whonix.org/t/dynamic-memory-management/434 dynamic memory management] of the RAM overhead might be a non-issue. By manually enabling these features it is possible to immediately profit. Eventually when Whonix 10 or a later version is released and [[KVM]] is in use, Whonix will enable this by default.

Whonix aims to be as accessible and usable as possible. Linux experts who were content with the older non-graphical version of Whonix-Gateway <ref>0.5.6</ref> may not appreciate the change, but Whonix is aimed at a broad audience. Whonix is also an attempt to recruit more {{Code2|casual users}}<ref>https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=57532</ref> <ref>See [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPWIA6D5Odg&lc=i9pytdxZ1Z9C1she5VfyQBYWIBXCvH8A80AFs309Cfg linked comment].</ref> to Tor, because {{Code2|the more people who use Tor, the better the anonymity that is provided}}<ref>
[https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en Quote]:

<blockquote>
[...] Ultimately the best protection is a social approach: the more Tor users there are near you and the more diverse their interests, the less dangerous it will be that you are one of them. Convince other people to use Tor, too!
</blockquote>
</ref>.

In the older, non-graphical version of Whonix-Gateway <ref>0.5.6</ref> it was difficult for users who had never used Linux before to complete tasks like upgrading or configuring obfuscated bridges. Many activities are simpler and easily accessible in a graphical desktop environment, such as:

* Setting up bridges / flashproxies.
* Auditing logs.
* Auditing iptables.
* Auditing the system architecture in general.
* Running [[Test|Tests]].
* Running [[Dev/Leak_Tests|Leak Tests]].
* Editing the Tor configuration file {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}.
* Editing the firewall settings folder {{Code2|/etc/whonxi_firewall.d}}.
* Reading status messages (whonixcheck and timesync).
* Changing the Tor circuit.
* Copying and pasting (configuration) commands, (error) messages and logs.
* Running tshark / wireshark.
* [[FAQ#What.27s_the_difference_of_installing_a_VPN_on_the_host_versus_installing_on_Whonix-Gateway.3F|Tunneling only Whonix-Gateway's traffic through a VPN]].


A black, text-only window (terminal) is intimidating for normal users. A graphical desktop environment is also a prerequisite for further planed improvements, such as a Whonix Controller. The proposed [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/132 graphical Whonix Controller] will provide buttons such as:

* "Create hidden blog", which creates a pre-configured blog.
* "Backup hidden service keys".
* A [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/167 Better Circumvention User Interface].
* And more.


Also, terminal-only environments are often unusable for users with disabilities. This is another reason why recent Whonix versions <ref>Since Whonix 6 and above</ref> feature an optional graphical desktop environment.

Users do not have many options if they believe the graphical Whonix-Gateway uses too much disk space and/or they want to achieve activities that Whonix was not designed for, such as running Whonix completely in RAM. Whonix was never developed with low installation size, low RAM, or low system requirements in mind. See also [[#Why are the Whonix images so big?]] and [[#Will there be a Whonix Live CD or DVD?]].

Advanced users can build Whonix from source code and use a build configuration to create a terminal-only version of Whonix-Gateway; refer to [[Dev/Build Documentation|Build Documentation]] if that is of interest.

Last but not least, a terminal-only version of Whonix-Gateway could be easily provided if the role of [[Contribute#Release_Manager|Release Manager]] was filled. This requires someone willing to build terminal-only versions of Whonix-Gateway, which is not strictly about development since it only requires running the build script and uploading it. Until more people are contributing to The Whonix Project, this won't be possible due to resource constraints.
