== What is Whonix? ==
{{project_name}} is software designed to preserve privacy and anonymity by helping users run applications anonymously. {{project_name}} can be installed on [[Windows]], [[MacOS|macOS]] and [[Linux]]. {{project name}} also comes pre-installed in [[Qubes]] ({{q_project_name}}). 

To learn more about the design and intended user groups, refer to the [[Main_Page#overview|wiki main page, overview]].

== How does Whonix work? == 
To protect a user's anonymity on the Internet all connections are forced through the Tor network and [https://www.whonix.org/#features numerous security mechanisms] are deployed. See also [[Main Page]] and [[About]].

== What is Tor? ==
Tor is free and open-source software for enabling anonymous communication. Thousands of volunteers are running computer servers that keep users anonymous on the Internet. It works by moving data across many Tor servers, called Tor relays. The role of each server is to move that data to another server, with the final hop moving data to the end site. As a result, information transmitted in this way is hard to trace. See also [[Why does Whonix use Tor|Why does Whonix use Tor?]]

{{Anchor|advantages}}
== What are the Advantages of Whonix? ==
{{Project name}} realistically addresses common attack vectors.

An [[Data_Collection_Techniques#IP_Address|IP address]] is a label which is used to identify a computer on the Internet. A simple analogy is an IP address is similar to a car license plate.

Hiding IP addresses is technically difficult for software. There is always a risk of so-called IP leaks, whereby a user mistakenly thinks the IP address is hidden when it is actually not.

{{Project name}} is the best solution to prevent IP leaks because it uses a more solid [[Main_Page#design|technical design]]. IP leak issues that previously applied to other software were not applicable to {{Project name}} in a number of cases; see [[Security in Real World|{{project name}} Protection against Real World Attacks]].

IP leaks are not the only issue that can break a user's anonymity. Other threats include [[Time Attacks|time attacks]], [[Keystroke Deanonymization|keystroke deanonymization]] and [[Data Collection Techniques|data collection techniques]]. {{Project name}} deploys [https://www.whonix.org/#features numerous security mechanisms] to mitigate such attacks.

== How is Whonix different from Tor Browser? ==
{{project_name}} [[Main_Page#design|protects]] you in case [[Malware|viruses]] are able to [[Security_in_Real_World#Tor_Browser_Bundle|bypass]] Tor Browser security.

{{project_name}} is a complete operating system (OS) that can be installed on top of your existing OS. A [[Tor Browser|web browser]], [[HexChat|IRC client]], [[Software#Office_Suite|office suite]], and [[Software|more]] come pre-configured with security in mind. See also [[Comparison with Others|Comparison of Whonix and Tor Browser]].

== How is Whonix different from Tails? ==
Tails is a live OS with optional persistence that can be installed on external drives such as a DVD or USB.

{{Project name}} can be installed inside your existing OS which might be running on internal or external drives. {{project name}} has an optional [[Whonix Live|live mode]], but there is no Whonix live iso at the time of writing -- this situation [[Dev/Technical_Introduction#future-live-dvd|is likely to change in the future]].

See also [[Comparison with Others|Comparison of Whonix and Tails]].

== How is Whonix different from a VPN? ==
Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) know your identity and online activity and can be compelled legally to share this information with authorities under various circumstances.

VPNs are usually faster than Tor, but they are not anonymity networks. VPN administrators can log both where a user is connecting from and the destination website, breaking anonymity in the process. Promises made by VPN operators are meaningless, since they cannot be verified. Tor provides anonymity by design rather than policy, making it impossible for a single point in the network to know both the origin and the destination of a connection. Anonymity by design provides much more security, since trust is removed from the equation. See also [[#advantages|advantages of Whonix]], [[Why does Whonix use Tor|Why does Whonix use Tor?]] and [[Comparison_Of_Tor_with_CGI_Proxies,_Proxy_Chains,_and_VPN_Services#Comparison_of_Tor_and_VPN_services|Comparison of Tor and VPN services]].

== What is a Virtual Machine? ==
In computing terms, a virtual machine (VM) is software which emulates a computer system and provides the functionality of a physical computer. In essence, VMs allow you to run OSes inside your current (real) OS -- {{project name}} is specifically designed for this purpose.

== Who Develops Whonix? ==
Whonix is being developed by an independent development [[team]].

== How Secure is Whonix? ==
Whonix has a solid history of providing [[Security_in_Real_World|Protection against Real World Attacks]].

== Should I Set Up a VPN with Whonix? ==
In a word, no. There are several reasons for this position: <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/setting-up-vpn-with-whonix-is-it-a-good-idea/7568</ref>

* It is impossible to verify a VPN provider is actually trustworthy and not logging data -- 'honeypot' providers might be ubiquitous.
** Recent research reveals that around one-third of all popular VPN providers are owned by Chinese companies, while others are based in countries like Pakistan, with non-existent or weak privacy laws. <ref>https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252466203/Top-VPNs-secretly-owned-by-Chinese-firms</ref> <ref>The implication is that traffic might be routinely examined in a high percentage of cases, despite corporate promises to the contrary.</ref>
* VPN traffic is sensitive to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_packet_inspection Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)] and [https://blog.torproject.org/critique-website-traffic-fingerprinting-attacks Website Traffic Fingerprinting], <ref><blockquote>Website traffic fingerprinting is an attack where the adversary attempts to recognize the encrypted traffic patterns of specific web pages without using any other information. In the case of Tor, this attack would take place between the user and the Guard node, or at the Guard node itself.</blockquote></ref> so it is ineffective in hiding use of {{project_name}} and Tor from the ISP or skilled adversaries.
* Depending on the configuration, VPN tunnels combined with Tor can worsen anonymity. For example it can lead to a permanent Tor exit relay in the network or remove [[Stream_Isolation|Stream Isolation]] of different online activities.
* Complicated and lengthy instructions can lead to mistakes and insecure tunnel configurations.
* It is difficult to anonymously register and pay for VPN services.
* Certain variables make it likely {{project_name}} / Tor users can be identified. This includes: the hardened network configuration fingerprint, the list of installed packages and those fetched from repositories, the amount of traffic going to one IP address daily (guard nodes), and examination of dropped (invalid) versus non-dropped packets when the firewall is probed. <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/hiding-tor-whonix-is-difficult-beyond-practicality/7408</ref>
* For a comprehensive list of additional reasons, see: [[Tunnels/Introduction#VPN_Tunnel_Risks|VPN Tunnel Risks]].

== Isn't it Dangerous to use a Platform based on Tor? ==

A number of myths and misconceptions concerning Tor are perpetuated by a lack of understanding, government propaganda, and a heavy media focus on the potential negative applications of Tor. Millions of people use Tor daily for wholly legitimate reasons, particularly to assert their privacy rights when faced with countless corporate / government network observers and censors. To learn more, see: [[Tor_Myths_and_Misconceptions|Tor Myths and Misconceptions]].

== Where are the Separate Gateway and Workstation Download Files? ==

{{project_name}} has introduced unified ova / libvirt downloads. <ref>From {{project_name}} 14 onward.</ref> Rather than separate {{gateway_product_name}} and {{workstation_product_name}} ova / libvirt downloads, there is now only a single {{project_name}} ova / libvirt which includes both Whonix VMs. <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-virtualbox-14-0-1-4-4-unified-ova-downloads-point-release/6996</ref> <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-kvm-14-0-1-4-4-unified-tar-gz-download-point-release/7061</ref> The Whonix split-VM design incorporating a separate {{gateway_product_name}} and {{workstation_product_name}} remains unchanged.
