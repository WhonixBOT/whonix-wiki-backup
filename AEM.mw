AEM notes.

Adversary capabilities

* physical access
* remove disk
* re-fash BIOS
* exfiltrate TPM

----

Anti Evil Maid (AEM) alternatives:

* BIOS password
** attack requires removal of disk
** there might be a BIOS master password
* boot partition on USB
** attack on BIOS required
** or USB persistent modifications
 attack on BIOS required

----

Anti Evil Maid security issues:

* download binary file SINIT without verification and hope the processor will correctly verify it
* rely on closed source TPM

----

Anti Evil Maid (AEM)

* authenticates machine to the user (not user to machine)
 reseal required
* another complicated password
* either text OR picture, not both
* picture support is going to be deprecated
* one time password support (2FA) coming
* measurement of Xen, kernel, and initrd versions
* only compatible with legacy boot
* not compatible with UEFI
* not compatible with USBVM
* not compatible with USB 3.0
* therefore install on internal device
* do not pass "-z" option, i.e. set AEM password
* hide USB from dom0 (more secure but also more fragile) (BadUSB attack) vs not-hide (able to use USB AEM)
 makes it easier for an evil maid (no need to change settings in BIOS)
 better yubikey
