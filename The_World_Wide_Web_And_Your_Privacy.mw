=== Introduction ===
It is difficult for most to imagine day-to-day life without the Internet. Online services provide convenience and the ability to solve common tasks and problems. Indeed, the reader may have today used online banking services, purchased goods or services from websites, researched a specific topic, sourced travel information, browsed entertainment or news sites, communicated with friends on social media, or shared opinions in forums with like-minded people.

To access the Internet, the user is offered dozens of stable, highly functional, and yet easy-to-use applications: web browsers. In 2017, the most popular browser by far is Chrome, with around three-quarters of browser market share. Lagging well behind is Mozilla's Firefox, Microsoft's Internet Explorer / Edge, Apple's Safari, and Opera.<ref>https://www.w3schools.com/browsers/</ref> <ref>Opera is owned by a Chinese consortium - Golden Brick Capital - as of 2016.</ref>

Unsurprisingly, some companies have entered the regulatory void and specialized in harvesting all accessible data. An untold number of individual user profiles are generated, storing data from browsing, communications and other activities. These databases have a high commercial value since they allow an enterprise to comprehensively profile the behavior and interests of their customers, which allows for targeted advertising. <ref>The corollary is that law enforcement and security agencies pursue the same profiling behavior for targeting persons or entities of interest.</ref> Modern surveillance capitalism dictates that you are the product. Profiles are often on-sold to other third parties. In computer lingo, this process is called data accumulation or [http://rs.eos-solutions.com/en/services/marketing-information/data-enhancement/ data enhancement], but the layperson knows it as "data mining".

There are many reasons to avoid leaving digital traces when browsing. Consider the following examples:

* Some of the data collected is used by credit scoring systems which are used to evaluate loan requests, to create individually priced offers or to decide on eligibility for "Cash/Collect on Delivery" service. 
* Employers may create or request a character profile of their job applicants from traces found on the Internet prior to hiring them. 
* Freedom of opinion is limited by governments or institutions that track individuals and what they read and say. These entities may even censor (block) certain web pages or services.
* Companies may recognize employees of other businesses or even those of their competition and subsequently harass them with promotional calls or email spam. 
* Browser-related data exposes vulnerabilities in the user's  computer, smartphone or peripheral electronic devices. A hacker may subsequently establish direct communications with the computer or device and attack it.
* Perhaps worst of all, digital traces are collected, saved, sent and processed without the explicit or implicit consent of the user, and often without their knowledge.


The take-home message is that decisions about an individual's life are frequently based on the digital litter they unknowingly scatter throughout the Internet. In the following section, the user is briefly introduced to several popular companies that are notorious for collecting and mining data.

=== Google ===

It is generally known that Google's business model is based on the collection of data and the analysis thereof. However, many users have no concept of the comprehensiveness of Google's surveillance, nor the extensive (and highly profitable) personal profiles generated from harvested data.

In general, Google is dismissive of the universal right to privacy, explaining their unsavory history of working hand-in-glove with government agencies. CEO Eric Schmidt declared in 2009: <ref>https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/12/07/schmidt_on_privacy/</ref>

<blockquote>"If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place. If you really need that kind of privacy, the reality is that search engines including Google do retain this information for some time and it's important, for example, that we are all subject in the United States to the Patriot Act and it is possible that all that information could be made available to the authorities."</blockquote>

==== Google Data Collection Techniques ====

The following is an inexhaustive list of Google techniques to collect personalized data: <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_and_privacy_issues</ref>

*<u>Cookies</u>. Google places cookies on a user's computer to track web browsing across a large number of unrelated websites, and to track search history. If logged into a Google service, cookies are used to record which account is accessing each website. As of 2016, Google's privacy policy makes no promises about whether/when web browsing and search records will be deleted from its records - it is safest to assume that this means indefinitely. <ref>Of interest is that in 2007, Google's cookies had a life span of more than 32 years. Google historically has shared information with law enforcement and government agencies, without review or approval of any court.</ref>
* <u>Data aggregators</u>. Google collects and aggregates data about users through developer tools such as Google Analytics, Google Fonts and Google APIs. This enables IP address tracking across successive sites (cross-domain web tracking). Developers are encouraged to use these tools and communicate IP addresses to Google.
* <u>Google search engine</u>. Google records what a user types into the web address field, sending that information to Google servers which populate search suggestions. If the user is signed into a Google account, those searches are saved in the account's web history. Searches are saved for years, if not indefinitely.
* <u>Google Chrome</u>. A host of user information is captured by Google's browser which is usually set to opt-in (with opt-out often impossible). For instance, even in Incognito mode, the history of programs used to stream media is captured. Chrome enables enhanced user tracking through web advertising, as indicated by Google's 2011 patent on this very issue.
* <u>Other browsers</u>. Google has previously bypassed privacy settings set by other browsers (for example, Safari's cookie blocking mechanism) in order to track online activities.
* <u>Gmail</u>. Email content is processed and read (scanned) by a computer for targeted advertising purposes and spam prevention. Under Google policies, there is an unlimited period of data retention and the potential for unintended secondary use of this information. Google has already admitted users have "no reasonable expectation" of confidentiality regarding personal emails.
* <u>Google Street View</u>. Google's online map service has extensively captured pictures of people's private homes, and collected a trove of data on unencrypted public and private WiFi networks world-wide. Google initially defied critics and stated they would not destroy the data until forced by regulators, despite the activity constituting widespread wiretapping.
* <u>Policies</u>. Google's insistence on real-name policies for Gmail and Youtube accounts, along with strict measures to prevent signing up via Tor, have significantly contributed to user profiling. Google has also dropped its ban on personally-identifiable information in ad services (see below).
* <u>Doubclick ads</u>. In 2016, Google changed the privacy policy to allow for web-browsing records obtained through DoubleClick to be combined with records gathered from other Google services.
* <u>Satellite imaging</u>. Google has acquired Skybox Imaging, which runs a network of high-definition, modern satellites which are used to collect and analyze micro-geographical and human data. <ref>https://www.macworld.co.uk/opinion/apple/privacy-wars-apple-google-technologys-next-big-thing-3526879/</ref> <ref>The satellites are allegedly powerful enough to see what is on your desk from orbit.</ref>


'''Summary'''

Google has built the infrastructure to build a complete profile of a user by name, which combines everything written in email, every website visited, and every search conducted.

As well as collecting population databases that enable the activities of authoritarian regimes, Google has previously acquired companies that have received capital from the investment arm of the CIA (In-Q-Tel), and cooperated with the NSA's PRISM surveillance program so they had direct access to company servers. Further, Google readily responds to US government requests for data on Google users worldwide.

Google is the greatest corporate threat to privacy and liberty worldwide, perhaps explaining why their motto was changed from "Don't be evil" to "Do the right thing" in 2015, since their blatant data-mining practices and hostility to anonymity were no longer defensible. <ref>Ironically, in this case the "right thing" is whatever government tells them it is; usually unfettered access to their extensive data records.</ref>

==== Google Revenue Model ==== 
According to an estimation done by experts there are ca. 1.5 million servers working for Google in different data centers. Every three months that amount is growing by 100,000. The annual costs of this infrastructure are approximately 2 billion dollar. Google's overall revenue is about 30 billion dollar every year with an annually profit of 7 billion dollar. 96 percent of Google's revenue is generated by personalized advertisements. (as at 2009)

The whole infrastructure may be used for free. It is not paid by money but by data. According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) Google is logging the traffic which can be linked to a particular person unambigously examining various characteristics. This affects the deployment of the search engine, of Google services like YouTube or Google Earth and applies as well to flashing advertisements on other web sites and of course to tracking tools like Google Analytics. The basic data is combined to comprehensive profiles of individual users surfing the web. Due to its popularity Google is almost able to capture the whole searching and surfing behavior. In Germany 89 percent of search requests go directly to Google. Besides, 85 percent of german web sites are contaminated with elements (Google Analytics, flashing of advertisements et cetera) allowing Google to track users across multiple web pages.

How exact and comprehensive Google's personal profiles are is hard to say. As a basis to estimate this one can use the data the company is providing to its advertisement partners. The following figure shows the aggregated statistics of a not further mentioned web site:

'''Figure:''' ''Google Visitor Statistics''

[[Image:google-chart.png|frame|none]]

Besides age and gender Google is able to estimate the education level and income of almost all web surfers. Additionally, there are their interests, political orientation and contact addresses (e-mail, instant messaging) that are not mentioned here but nevertheless collected by Google as well. As the Wall Street Journal writes in an [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703940904575395073512989404.html analysis] there are even ways to assess the likelihood of a payment by credit card. The researchers Bin Cheng and Paul Francis from Max Planck Institute for Software Systems show that it is possible to [http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/10/more-privacy-headaches-for-facebook-gay-users-outed-to-advertisers.ars ferret out gay users by anaylizing clicks on advertisements]. Their method can be adapted to any kind of questions and may for instance be used to deliver individual advertisements.

The tracking and observation of users can be detected especially good in the case of [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Behavioral_retargeting retargeting]. If one does not buy anything while visiting a web shop one is often overwhelmed with advertisements of similar products in the aftermath. Google is offering a special AdSense program with retargeting.

=== RapLeaf ===

The company [https://www.rapleaf.com/ RapLeaf] is collecting data profiles via e-mail addresses. The data is not used for personalized advertisements. Rather, it is just sold. As a potential buyer one is passing a list of e-mail addresses to RapLeaf and gets the profiles back (according to the comprehensiveness intented) after paying the bill. The following is a short abridgment out of the price list (as at 2011):

* Age, Gender and Location: 0 Cent (loss leader)
* Household income: 1 Cent per e-mail address
* Marital Status: 1 Cent per e-mail address
* Presence of Children: 1 Cent per e-mail address
* Home Market Value: 1 Cent per e-mail address
* Loan-to-Value Ratio: 1 Cent per e-mail address
* Available Credit Cards: 1 Cent per e-mail address
* Cars in Household: 1 Cent per e-mail address
* Likely Smartphone User: 3 Cent per e-mail address
* Occupation and Education: 2 Cent per e-mail address
* Blogger: 3 Cent per e-mail address
* Charitable Donor: 3 Cent per e-mail address
* High-End Brand Buyer: 3 Cent per e-mail address
* Interested in Books/Magazines: 3 Cent per e-mail address
* ...

The data is gathered by correlating e-mail usage with surfing behavior or obtained via the time and time again happening data leaks at online merchants' platforms. One of the main investors is [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Peter_Thiel Peter Thiel], who founded PayPal and is co-determining the development of Facebook in the background in a significant way. It has to be assumed that RapLeaf uses data collections of these internet companies as well. Furthermore, data stemming from Twitter and other data bases offering commercial access is included into the processing.

=== Facebook ===

'''Economic figures:''' The "social net" Facebook is supposed to have 600 million users worldwide. The stock exchange value of the company is estimated to 50 billion dollar and the profit was 353 million dollar in 2010. The earnings amount to 4-5 dollar for every user in one year. (as at 2011)

Facebook is for free and the user's data is the basis for the commercial success as well. Data that is entered intentionally and in a controlled way is only playing a minor role here. Far more important is the information extracted out of the users' behavior. This data and the derived information is not controlled by users. But they have agreed to a commercial use of them when they registered themselves.

==== Connections Between Friends ====

The contact relationships of users are analyzed with different goals in mind. First of all they are used for friend-2-friend advertisements. Many users are not aware of the fact that they serve as an advertising medium. The targeted advertising gets improved by [http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christopher_Lettl/publication/46553783_Distinctive_Roles_of_Lead_Users_and_Opinion_Leaders_in_the_Social_Networks_of_Schoolchildren/links/0046351d56c8219d52000000.pdf?origin=publication_detail identifying opinion leaders in contact networks] that get addressed (e.g. in order to publish sponsored stories).

Another way of analyzing contacts is demonstrated by [http://mashable.com/2009/09/21/facebook-friends-sexual-orientation/ Gaydar]. Looking at the contacts in Facebook profiles MIT students extracted the sexual orientation of the respective account owner. Such kind of information could influence a career.

==== Analyzing Gaming Behavior ====

Facebook offers different games for its members like "Farmville" or "Mafia Wars". The moves of the participants are analyzed and character traits are derived. The profiles are then commercialized. Companies can buy profiles of potential applicants.

==== Facial Recognition ====

Publishing private pictures is one of the most popular activities on Facebook. Meanwhile a software for facial recognition is deployed. According to Facebook several million persons are identified on uploaded pictures daily.

With it a huge database is created which shall be used commercially. In the future, customers entering a shop could get identified by a camera and the salesman could access a comprehensive personal profile (for money).

''"Show us 14 photos of yourself and we can identify who you are. You think you don't have 14 photos of yourself on the internet? You've got Facebook photos!"'' said Eric Schmidt (then CEO of Google) on the Techonomy conference August 4, 2010.

==== Advanced Adversaries ====

Public authorities and secret services are using the information provided by Facebook and snoop in the users' private lifes. The Israeli military [http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=196426 is scanning Facebook profiles of Israelis dodging the draft]. Secret services of other countries are acting more aggressively. The Agence Tunisienne d'Internet (ATI) used "Javascript Injection Attacks" in order to get the login data of suspected activists. Their profiles got owned and scanned for evidence. The result were detentions based on these data.

==== Privacy Policy ====

"''Mir sind keine Datenschutzbestimmungen von Facebook bekannt, die diesen Namen verdienen. Es handelt sich um Nutzungsregelungen, die grob nach dem Muster ablaufen: Du Nutzer bist für alles verantwortlich, was Du bei uns machst. Und wir dürfen mit den Daten dann alles machen, was uns gefällt.''" (Dr. Thilo Weichert, data protection commissioner of Schleswig-Holstein (Germany))

Translation: "''According to my information there is no privacy policy that deserves its name. It is all about terms and conditions that are roughly working like this: You user are responsible for everything you are doing here. And we may do with the data everything we like to do.''"

Facebook is going to be a "net within the net" with orwellian visions.

=== Twitter ===

'''Economic figures:''' Twitter has an estimated amount of 200 million users. Every single user causes costs of about 1 dollar a year. (as at 2010)

Contrary to Google and Facebook Twitter did not manage it to use the data itself profitably. The earnings out of the advertisements fell far short of expectations.

Twitter's business model is selling access to its database. Twitter is providing 40 parameters (content, location, date, account, used software, language, retweets...) for every Tweet. Paying 60,000 dollar a year one can access 5 percent of the Tweets, paying 300,000 dollar a year one can access the whole database. Twitters database is a rich source of information that may not be found somewhere else for market research purposes, advertisements or secret services.
