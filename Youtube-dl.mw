= Introduction =

<code>youtube-dl</code> is: <ref>https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/</ref>
<blockquote>... a command-line program to download videos from YouTube.com and a few more sites. It requires the Python interpreter (2.6, 2.7, or 3.2+), and it is not platform specific. We also provide a Windows executable that includes Python. youtube-dl should work in your Unix box, in Windows or in Mac OS X. It is released to the public domain, which means you can modify it, redistribute it or use it however you like.</blockquote>

<code>youtube-dl</code> is simple to use in {{project_name}}. Simply follow the instructions to install it below, identify the relevant YouTube video URL, then run the application in a terminal to download the video. Once it has finished downloading, VLC Media Player (installed by default) can be used to view the video.

= Installation =

The {{project_name}} wiki normally recommends that additional software is [[Install_Software#Install_from_Debian_stable|installed from Debian stable]], but in the case of <code>youtube-dl</code> there is often a significant difference between the stable and backports versions. Since the developers frequently update the software to address broken functionality when attempting downloads from various websites, an upgrade of <code>youtube-dl</code> from Debian backports may be required. <ref>At the time of writing, the [https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/youtube-dl Debian package tracker] shows stable has a 2019 version, while backports has a late 2020 version available.</ref>

{{Install Backport|package=

= Usage =

First identify the relevant YouTube video URL in Tor Browser, then right-click the link and select "Copy Link Location". In the example below it is "Why Do so Many People Hate Windows 10?" (https://youtube.com/watch?v=KpEb8M23LsU)
