= Introduction =

{{kicksecure disclaimer}}

An existing Debian <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}</code> installation can be converted into [[Kicksecure|{{kicksecure}}]] by installing the {{kicksecure}} deb package. This procedure is also called [https://forums.whonix.org/t/sudo-apt-get-install-whonix-part-i-distro-morphing/2346 distro-morphing].

There is no downloadable [[#ISO|iso]] yet but it will be available in the future. In the meantime install Debian on the host or inside a VM, then install {{kicksecure}} on top.

To increase the chances of success, it is best to start with a minimal installation without GUI (or Xfce if there must be a GUI) and then installing a meta package (cli or xfce). <ref>

</ref> It is easiest to set the Linux user account name to <code>user</code> during the installation of Debian <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}</code>.

{{Project-APT-Repository-Add}}

== Install the {{kicksecure}} Package ==

Pick a package.

* <code>kicksecure-cli</code>: command line interface (CLI) version only. This does not modify your graphical desktop environment. You will get better kernel hardening, better entropy, and [[Kicksecure#Hardening_by_Default|more security features]].
* <code>kicksecure-xfce</code>: Same as <code>kicksecure-cli</code> but installs the XFCE graphical desktop environment and default applications. This is useful if you installed Debian without a graphical desktop environment and want to set up the {{Kicksecure}} graphical desktop environment which is XFCE.
* Qubes users:
** <code>kicksecure-qubes-cli</code> (coming soon in {{Kicksecure}} 16)
** <code>kicksecure-qubes-gui</code> (coming soon in {{Kicksecure}} 16)

{{Box|text=
Install {{Kicksecure}} package such as <code>kicksecure-cli</code>.

When asked about <code>Configuration file '/etc/machine-id'</code>, say <code>y</code> yes <code>Enter</code> and install.

Check if there is some APT source in <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> which should be kept.

Move original <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> out of the way (or delete) because <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list</code> by {{Kicksecure}} replaces it.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo mv /etc/apt/sources.list ~/
}}

Create empty <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code>. <ref>
https://forums.whonix.org/t/command-not-found-warningcould-not-open-file-etc-apt-sources-list/7903

This can be avoided once package whonix-legacy has been renamed and ported to Kicksecure since it automates this.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo touch /etc/apt/sources.list
}}

Installation of {{Kicksecure}} is complete.
