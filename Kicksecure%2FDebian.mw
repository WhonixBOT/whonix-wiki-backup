= Introduction =

{{kicksecure disclaimer}}

An existing Debian <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}</code> installation can be converted into [[Kicksecure|{{kicksecure}}]] by installing the {{kicksecure}} deb package. This procedure is also called [https://forums.whonix.org/t/sudo-apt-get-install-whonix-part-i-distro-morphing/2346 distro-morphing].

There is no downloadable [[#ISO|iso]] yet but it will be available in the future. In the meantime install Debian on the host or inside a VM, then install {{kicksecure}} on top.

To increase the chances of success, it is best to start with a minimal installation without GUI (or Xfce if there must be a GUI) and then install a meta package (cli or xfce). <ref>

</ref> It is easiest to set the Linux user account name to <code>user</code> during the installation of Debian <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}</code>.

== Install the {{kicksecure}} Package ==

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Pick a {{kicksecure}} package.

* <code>kicksecure-cli</code>: command line interface (CLI) version only. This does not modify the graphical desktop environment. This package provides better kernel hardening, improved entropy, and [[Kicksecure#Hardening_by_Default|other security features]].
* <code>kicksecure-xfce</code>: this is the same as <code>kicksecure-cli</code> but it installs the Xfce graphical desktop environment and default applications. This is useful if Debian was installed without a graphical desktop environment and the {{Kicksecure}} graphical desktop environment (Xfce) is desired.
* Qubes users:
** <code>kicksecure-qubes-cli</code>
** <code>kicksecure-qubes-gui</code>

'''2.''' Install a {{Kicksecure}} package such as <code>kicksecure-cli</code>.

{{Install Package|package=
kicksecure-cli
}}

'''3.''' Finalize configuration file settings.

When asked about <code>Configuration file '/etc/machine-id'</code>, type:
* <code>y</code> (yes) &rarr; <code>Enter</code> &rarr; <code>install</code>

'''4.''' Check APT sources.

Check if some APT sources in <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> should be kept.

Move the original <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> file out of the way (or delete it) because it is replaced by {{kicksecure}}'s <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo mv /etc/apt/sources.list ~/
}}

'''5.''' Create an empty <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> file. <ref>
https://forums.whonix.org/t/command-not-found-warningcould-not-open-file-etc-apt-sources-list/7903

This can be avoided once package <code>whonix-legacy</code> is renamed and ported to {{kicksecure}} because it automates this process.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo touch /etc/apt/sources.list
}}

The {{Kicksecure}} installation is complete.
