= Privacy on the {{project name}} Website =
The {{project name}} website <ref>Clearnet address: https://www.whonix.org and v3 onion address: {{project_onion}}</ref> is using popular web applications (web apps) like [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki MediaWiki], [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/ Phabricator] and [https://www.discourse.org/ Discourse] (forum software). <ref>
This is common practice. For example [https://www.fsf.org/blogs/membership/introducing-our-new-associate-member-forum Free Software Foundation (FSF) also uses discourse.]
</ref> These are Freedom Software projects which are developed by third parties and not the {{project name}} team. As an end user of web apps, whonix.org has no control over changes made by the respective developers, whom do not necessarily (seldom in fact) prioritize privacy and security.

The {{project name}} platform is similarly based on many third party projects. For a simple (approximate) overview of the {{project name}} organizational structure, see: [[Linux_User_Experience_versus_Commercial_Operating_Systems|Linux User Experience versus Commercial Operating Systems]]. In essence, many independent projects provide their software and source code for free, and they can be modified or used in their default state. Due to the [[#Software Comparison|structure]] of Freedom Software development and the limited [[#Funding Comparison|funding]] available to {{project_name}}, it is infeasible to try and tackle usability, privacy and security issues posed by these web apps.

Consider the Discourse software for example:

* Google is used as the default search engine, even though it would be far preferable to configure another search engine which respects privacy. {{project name}} developers posted a [https://meta.discourse.org/t/feature-request-configurable-search-engine-for-forum-search/35793 Feature request: configurable search engine for forum search], but  discourse developers in essence replied "patches welcome".
* [https://forums.whonix.org/t/moderating-threads-moving-editing-does-not-always-funtion-properly/6334/6 Discourse does not work well with secondary onions].

Based on the preceding information, it is clear websites can at best only provide privacy <u>by policy</u>, which is equivalent to a promise. For detailed information on the {{project name}} privacy policy, see [[Privacy Policy|here]]. <ref>This includes any type of information that is collected and recorded, and how it may be used. The processing of any personal information is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</ref>

In contrast, the [[What we do|main project activities]] undertaken by {{project name}} include research, development and maintenance of [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}} privacy <u>by design</u> software]. This is achieved via technological enforcement, [[Why_{{project_name_short}}_is_Freedom_Software|remaining free]], <ref>Free in terms of price, while also respecting user and developer freedoms.</ref> and utilizing Freedom Software which encourages external contributions, enhancements and audits.
