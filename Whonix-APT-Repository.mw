= Disable Whonix APT Repository =
== Introduction ==
For [[Trust]] reasons you may prefer not to use Whonix's APT Repository. You can still [[Dev/BuildDocumentation|update Whonix's debian packages from source code]]. It is just less convenient.

== If you have build Whonix from Source Code ==
Since Whonix version 7.3.3 if you have [[Dev/Build Documentation|build]] Whonix from source code, by default, Whonix's APT Repository does not get added. (Unless you [[Template:Build Documentation Whonix APT Repository|opted in]] using a build configuration.) You can still [[#Verify Disabled Whonix Apt Repository|verify]], that it already is disabled, though.

== If you are using the Default-Download-Version ==
If Whonix is already installed, you can disable Whonix's APT repository using the graphical Whonix Repository tool.

(Whonix 7.3.3 and above)
<pre>
Start Menu -> Applications -> System -> Whonix Repository -> "Deactivate Whonix Repository"
</pre>

Or in terminal. (Whonix 6 and above.)

<pre>whonix_repository --disable</pre>

Feel free to [[#Verify Disabled Whonix Apt Repository|verify]] this.

== Verify Disabled Whonix Apt Repository ==
If you want to check, if disabling Whonix's apt repository was successful, you can run the following tests.

Use {{Code2|apt-key}}.

<pre>
sudo apt-key finger
</pre>

It should not show any Whonix specific keys, it should not show adrelanos's OpenPGP key.

Have a look if {{Code2|/etc/apt/sources.list.d/whonix.list}} exists. If it doesn't exist, everything is fine.

If you are extra paranoid, see footnote. <ref>
The following isn't necessary, because the whonix_repository tool has never wrote another sources.list file other than {{Code2|/etc/apt/sources.list.d/whonix.list}}.

Examine your {{Code2|/etc/apt/sources.list}}.

<pre>
cat /etc/apt/sources.list
</pre>

It should not include Whonix's APT Repository.

Examine your {{Code2|/etc/apt/sources.list.d/}} folder as well.

<pre>
cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*
</pre>
</ref>
