= Whonix APT Repository Overview =
Whonix's <u>developers</u> APT repository likely contain untested changes. It's recommended against to use it unless you are in touch with the development team. When we are reasonably sure, that these changes won't break Whonix's update system, they may be migrated to Whonix's testers repository where a wider audience is supposed to test them.

Whonix's <u>testers</u> APT repository is for testers-only. Even though briefly tested by Whonix developers, it may may break apt-get during upgrade. Eventually running a few manual commands are required to fix it. Making a clone and be prepared to roll back in case anything goes wrong is recommended. After testing by a wider audience, packages are migrated to Whonix's stable repository.

Whonix's <u>stable</u> APT repository is recommended for most users. Even if you're not using your production system to test Whonix's testers-only packages, you're encouraged to run separate Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation, that use Whonix's testers repository. This is because, if too few people are actually testing Whonix, it might happen that changes that are migrated to Whonix's stable repository are still causing issues.

= Change Whonix APT Repository =
You can switch from one repository to another.

<pre>
Start Menu -> Applications -> System -> Whonix Repository -> chose either "testers" or "stable" repository
</pre>

Or in terminal.

<pre>
sudo whonix_repository
</pre>

To use the repository, see the [[Security_Guide#Updates|usual instructions for updating]].

= Disable Whonix APT Repository =
== Introduction ==
For [[Trust]] reasons you may prefer not to use Whonix's APT Repository. You can still [[Dev/BuildDocumentation|update Whonix's debian packages from source code]]. It is just less convenient.

== If you have build Whonix from Source Code ==
If you have [[Dev/Build Documentation|build]] Whonix from source code, by default, Whonix's APT Repository does not get added. (Unless you [[Template:Build Documentation Whonix APT Repository|opted in]] using a build configuration.) You can still [[#Verify Disabled Whonix APT Repository|verify]], that it already is disabled, though.

== If you are using the Default-Download-Version ==
By default, Whonix's apt repository is disabled at first boot. You will be asked on first boot if you want to enable it or prefer to leave it disabled.

If Whonix apt repository is already enabled, you can disable Whonix's APT repository using the graphical or terminal Whonix repository tool.

<pre>
Start Menu -> Applications -> System -> Whonix Repository -> "Deactivate Whonix Repository"
</pre>

Or in terminal.

<pre>sudo whonix_repository --disable</pre>

Feel free to [[#Verify Disabled Whonix Apt Repository|verify]] this.

== Verify Disabled Whonix APT Repository ==
If you want to check, if disabling Whonix's apt repository was successful, you can run the following tests.

Use {{Code2|apt-key}}.

<pre>
sudo apt-key finger
</pre>

It should not show any Whonix specific keys, it should not show [[Patrick Schleizer|Patrick Schleizer's]] OpenPGP key.

Have a look if {{Code2|/etc/apt/sources.list.d/whonix.list}} exists. If it doesn't exist, everything is fine.

If you are extra paranoid, see footnote. <ref>
The following isn't necessary, because the whonix_repository tool has never written another sources.list file other than {{Code2|/etc/apt/sources.list.d/whonix.list}}.

Examine your {{Code2|/etc/apt/sources.list}}.

<pre>
cat /etc/apt/sources.list
</pre>

It should not include Whonix's APT Repository.

Examine your {{Code2|/etc/apt/sources.list.d/}} folder as well.

<pre>
cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*
</pre>
</ref>
