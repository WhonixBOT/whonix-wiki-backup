'''UNFINISHED!'''

== What is KVM? ==
For an openly developed, FOSS GPL licensed hypervisor, it is recommended you use KVM [Kernel Virtual Machine] that comes with the GNU/Linux OS. KVM combined with the VirtualMachineManager front-end should provide a familiar and intuitive, easy to use GUI.

For a detailed view on its security merits read the report issued by an independent security auditing firm: http://www.atsec.com/downloads/white-papers/kvm_security_comparison.pdf

== Why Use KVM Over VirtualBox? ==
Recently, the VirtualBox developer team have taken the decision to switch out the BIOS in their hypervisor with one that requires compilation by a toolchain that does not meet the definition of Free Software as per the guidelines of the Free Software Foundation. This move has been deemed problematic for free and open source software projects like Debian, on which Whonix is based. https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Virtualization_Platform#VirtualBox_no_longer_in_Debian_mai...

The issues of the Open Watcom License are explained in this thread on the Debian Mailinglist: http://www.mail-archive.com/debian-legal@lists.debian.org/msg34687.html and can be summarized as issues surrounding the contradictory language of the license, the assertion of patents against software that relies on it and the placing of certain restrictions on uses of the software.

For those who care about running Free Software and appreciate its ethical views, it is recommended that you avoid running VirtualBox, for that reason alone if nothing else.

Besides this licensing issue which may or may not be of concern to users, a more tangible reason can be the security practices of Oracle, the corporation behind VirtualBox. Recent events and news (see Snowden leaks) have shown the urgent need for increased transparency and trust in the digital world. Oracle is infamous for their lack of transparency in disclosing security bugs details and for discouraging public full disclosure by third parties.
http://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/vulnerability-remediation/disclosure/index.html << security through obscurity is the modus operandi at Oracle.
http://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/vulnerability-remediation/reporting-security-vu... << Oracle calls it "responsible disclosure" which is actually security through obscurity. Not going public with a vulnerability and its details only leads to laziness and complacency on part of the company that fields the affected products.
http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Apr/343 << A 0day reported privately to Oracle in 2008 by an independent security researcher has remained unfixed as of 2012 when this post was written.

Furthermore VirtualBox contains significant functionality that is only available as a proprietary extension, such as USB and PCI passthrough and RDP connectivity. Seeing Oracle's unfriendly trackrecord with the free software community in the past; examples include OpenSolaris and OpenOffice, it would not be a strecth to imagine them charging money for the closed up features at some point in the future or simply abandoning the project if they cannot monetize it to their liking.

== KVM Setup Instructions ==
It is highly recommended you use the GUI VirtualMachineManager package to configure your vm for simplicity and ease of use.

=== Convert ===
1. Extract the downloaded Whonix ova images to obtain the VMDK virtual storage files.

<pre>
tar -xvf ~/Whonix.ova
</pre>

As of now, VMDK files cannot be directly used by KVM or converted to a file type supported by KVM.

<pre>
VBoxManage clonehd --format VDI vmdk_file vdi_file
</pre>

(You need to adjust the names vmdk_file and vdi_file.)

2. Use qemu-img to convert the vdi to qcow2. Why qcow2? Because it supports snapshotting, which is very useful for reverting Whonix-Workstation to a known clean state. You must not revert gateway snapshots of the gateway vm as that will change your guard nodes which is not good for anonymity. This would increase your chances of having a rogue guard node and exit.

<pre>
qemu-img convert -p -O qcow2 ~/whonix.vdi ~/whonix.qcow2
</pre>

=== Other Required Steps ===
3. Before starting the new vm wizard we must create an internal isolated network that connects the workstation with the gateway.

Go to the VMM GUI --> Edit --> Connection Details --> Add button
Choose whonix as network name
Edit subnet range to 10.0.0.2/24
Uncheck the dhcpv4 option
Ignore anything to do with ipv6
Keep the default option of: Isolated Virtual Network selected and click finish.

The next steps may need more work to customize vm devices and clock to safe defaults. Work in this area not final.

4. Create a Whonix Gateway vm first and choose to edit it before installation.
Customize the first NIC that is included to be in default NAT mode.
Click to add hardware and chose another NIC.
This new NIC must have the newly created isolated virtual network 'whonix' selected as the network device. Finalize and launch.
Must enable disk controller as SATA
Must select qcow2 as storage format.

5. Create Whonix Workstation vm and  make sure you select the isolated int. network for the only NIC this machine has. Launch.
Disk Controller works only with IDE
Must select qcow2 as storage format

Don't forget to take snapshot.

Done!

-SPICE is enabled for graphics by default but needs a vdagent to be installed in the guest vms for accelerated 2D in vm to happen. Not included in workstation install by default which impacts performance greatly.

http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/SPICE

It should be safe for use unless you Adrelanos determine otherwise. 2D and 3D in VBox have an insecure architecture and even the manuals admit to this. 2D in VBox is not even available for anything but windows guests which is not recommended and insecure of course.  Everything Linux based is designed from the ground up with security considerations in mind.

Clock disabling for vms on host is recommended by Adrelanos. Still haven't done it yet,  and it seems to need command line.

Forum thread: [[Special:AWCforum/st/id306/]]

== Enabling SPICE == 
SPICE allows accelerated graphics and clipboard sharing. Its implications for security are an open question that needs a detailed answer rather than a vague clear cut one.

1. Enable SPICE by selecting it from the VMM GUI. (It is the default option if you decide not select VNC when creating the VM).
 
Not enabling SPICE from the beginning, will prevent the spice channel device from being added which impacts performance. To fix this add a channel device and select SPICE. This steps is not necessary if you leave the defaults as they are at the beginning.

2. QXL is the GPU model that should be attached.

3. Install vdagent in guest and reboot.
