|description=Using Whonix with KVM instead of VirtualBox
}}

== What is KVM? ==
For an openly developed, FOSS GPL licensed hypervisor, it is recommended you use KVM [Kernel Virtual Machine] that comes with the GNU/Linux OS. KVM combined with the VirtualMachineManager front-end should provide a familiar and intuitive, easy to use GUI.

For a detailed view on its security merits read the report issued by an independent security auditing firm: http://www.atsec.com/downloads/white-papers/kvm_security_comparison.pdf

== Why Use KVM Over VirtualBox? ==
Recently, the VirtualBox developer team have taken the decision to switch out the BIOS in their hypervisor with one that requires compilation by a toolchain that does not meet the definition of Free Software as per the guidelines of the Free Software Foundation. This move has been deemed problematic for free and open source software projects like Debian, on which Whonix is based. https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Virtualization_Platform#VirtualBox_no_longer_in_Debian_mai...

The issues of the Open Watcom License are explained in this thread on the Debian Mailinglist: http://www.mail-archive.com/debian-legal@lists.debian.org/msg34687.html and can be summarized as issues surrounding the contradictory language of the license, the assertion of patents against software that relies on it and the placing of certain restrictions on uses of the software.

For those who care about running Free Software and appreciate its ethical views, it is recommended that you avoid running VirtualBox, for that reason alone if nothing else.

Besides this licensing issue which may or may not be of concern to users, a more tangible reason can be the security practices of Oracle, the corporation behind VirtualBox. Recent events and news (see Snowden leaks) have shown the urgent need for increased transparency and trust in the digital world. Oracle is infamous for their lack of transparency in disclosing security bugs details and for discouraging public full disclosure by third parties.
http://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/vulnerability-remediation/disclosure/index.html << security through obscurity is the modus operandi at Oracle.
http://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/vulnerability-remediation/reporting-security-vu... << Oracle calls it "responsible disclosure" which is actually security through obscurity. Not going public with a vulnerability and its details only leads to laziness and complacency on part of the company that fields the affected products.
http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Apr/343 << A 0day reported privately to Oracle in 2008 by an independent security researcher has remained unfixed as of 2012 when this post was written.

Furthermore VirtualBox contains significant functionality that is only available as a proprietary extension, such as USB and PCI passthrough and RDP connectivity. Seeing Oracle's unfriendly trackrecord with the free software community in the past; examples include OpenSolaris and OpenOffice, it would not be a stretch to imagine them charging money for the closed up features at some point in the future or simply abandoning the project if they cannot monetize it to their liking.

== KVM Setup Instructions ==

It is highly recommended you read and apply the steps outlined in the README file that's included in the tar archive you downloaded. By applying a known and tested configuration, you will be better off in convenience and security.

Make sure you use the qcow2 images that are provided by the Whonix project instead of rolling your own. <ref>As in, manually converting them from .ova to .qcow2 is no longer recommended, since you can download .qcow images from the Whonix project.</ref> They contain important performance optimizations. <ref>As per [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/build-steps.d/2400_convert-img-to-qcow2 build-steps.d/2400_convert-img-to-qcow2], these are "-o cluster_size=2M" and "-o preallocation=metadata".</ref> (Unless you [[Dev/Build_Documentation|created them from source]]. <ref>Because then you have the same performance optimizations.</ref>)

If you have issues with free disk space, using a file system supporting sparse files is recommended, also see [https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php?topic=153 forum discussion].


1. Make sure you verify the integrity of your download by using gpg to make sure that your downloads have not been tampered with. See here: https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Verify_the_virtual_machine_images_using_the_command_line

2. Use tar or any graphical based file archiver to decompress the archive;

<pre>
sudo tar xvf Whonix-Gateway-X.X.qcow2.xz 
</pre>

Do not use unxz! Extract the images using tar
