__FORCETOC__

= Introduction =

You can still volunteer to Tor and host a bridge, private bridge, obfuscated bridge, private obfuscated bridge, middle node or exit relay when you are using {{project_name}}. Either inside the {{gateway_product_name}} or directly on the host.

= Configuration =

== Outside the {{gateway_product_name}} ==

'''KVM'''
For KVM, follow the NAT port forwarding instructions for {{gateway_product_name}}. <ref>http://wiki.libvirt.org/page/Networking#Forwarding_Incoming_Connections </ref>

== Inside the {{gateway_product_name}} ==
This chapter hasn't been tested for a long time. Get in contact if you are interested in this configuration.

Simply follow all the usual instructions given on torproject.org inside the {{gateway_product_name}} just as you would, if Tor wouldn't run inside a virtual machine. The only additional thing to do is to set up a port forwarding from the host to the virtual machine. That is simple. It is a VirtualBox feature. You can also do this with the VirtualBox graphical user interface. Go to {{gateway_product_name}} &rarr; Settings &rarr; Network Interface &rarr; Port Forwarding.

What's left are the firewall rules. On the {{gateway_product_name}} look at [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/{{project_name_short}}/blob/master/whonix_gateway/etc/whonix_firewall.d/30_default.conf {{Code|/etc/whonix_firewall/30_default.conf}}]. Read the introduction comment (which is about [[{{project name short}}_Configuration_Files|{{project_name}} flexible modular configuration files]]) and Tor Relay Settings.

{{Firewall Settings}}

Paste the following content. Adjust if necessary.

{{CodeSelect|code=
## Allow incoming DIRPORT connections for an optional Tor relay.
GATEWAY_ALLOW_INCOMING_DIR_PORT=1

## Allow incoming ORPORT connections for an optional Tor relay.
GATEWAY_ALLOW_INCOMING_OR_PORT=1

## DIRPORT incoming port.
DIR_PORT=80

## ORPORT incoming port.
OR_PORT=443
}}

{{Reload Firewall}}

= Other Easy Options =
As a Firefox or Chrome browser / Chromium user, install an add-on to create a "flash" proxy bridge. "Flash" as in flashing proxy, not as in Adobe Flash. This has nothing to do with Adobe Flash.

For Chrome browser / Chromium, there is [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cupcake/dajjbehmbnbppjkcnpdkaniapgdppdnc cupcake]. Simply click to install the add-on and you're done.

For Firefox browser, there is [https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tor-flashproxy-badge/ Tor Flashproxy Badge]. Simply click to install the add-on and you're done.
