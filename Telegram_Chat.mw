= Admins =
The personal opinions of moderators or contributors to the Whonix project do not represent the project as a whole.

= Reasons for Two Telegram Discussion Groups =
This is what happened. A spambot joined the [https://t.me/Whonix_Chat "normal, main" Whonix chat] and posted pornographic content (video). It was quickly deleted by an administrator. Telegram, [https://t.me/AbuseNotifications @AbuseNotifications] sent a private message to all channel administrators.

<blockquote>
Our users reported some of the content posted in your group @Whonix_Chat as pornographic, and our moderators have confirmed this.
For this reason, we had to restrict access to your group from iOS devices and from some countries.
Weâ€™ll be glad to lift the restrictions, if you remove pornographic content from your group and pledge to take reasonable care of moderation in future. Please notify us here as soon as the group is free from porn again.
If all the offending content is already removed please send us the following command:  /unblock_group1336747164@AbuseNotifications
</blockquote>

This happened to other chat groups on telegram too. See: https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/9ifp7s/group_blocked_because_of_pornographic_content/

Telegram is probably adamant about this because apparently there is a strict ban on pornography required by Apple policy for iPhone's AppStore. Telegram doesn't want to be kicked out of iPhone's AppStore because then less users would use telegram.

Apple iPhone restricts freedom of its users and consists of mostly non-freedom software. Therefore [[Avoid_nonfreedom_software|Avoid Non-Freedom Software]]. See also this essay by the GNU project [https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-apple.en.html Apple's Operating Systems Are Malware].

Telegram has a bad way to deal with spam.

Option would have been to disable all media in Whonix main telegram discussion channel but that would be dull because many users post screenshots.

= Criticisms =
The telegram client is Freedom Software. Telegram server at time of writing is non-freedom software.
