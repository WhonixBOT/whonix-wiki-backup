Applications such as ssh, gpg, wget, curl, git, and apt-get are configured for stream isolation by default; the full list can be found [[Stream_Isolation#List|here]]. The advantage of this configuration is that these applications will take different paths through the [[Tor]] network and will therefore be more anonymous, since it protects against identity correlation through Tor circuit sharing. <ref>If stream isolation is not enforced, different activities conducted in separate applications may pass through the same Tor circuit and exit relay, correlating these activities to the same pseudonym.</ref>

This arrangement comes with a small usability impact in corner cases:

* For some tunnels it may be necessary to disable stream isolation -- this is covered in the [[Tunnels/Introduction|Combining Tunnels with Tor]] chapter.
* This setting [[Stream_Isolation#Deactivate_Stream_Isolation|must be disabled]] for applications that require local connections. For example, this is the case for opening a local ssh listener:
** If the following command is run: <code>ssh 10.152.152.11</code>, <code>uwt</code> will actually execute <code>torsocks /usr/bin/ssh.anondist-orig 10.152.152.11</code>. In this case, traffic would flow though <code>torsocks</code> via a Tor <code>SocksPort</code>. This will fail for local connections and lead to the following error message:

<pre>
libtorsocks(12021): connect: Connection is to a local address (10.152.152.11), may be a TCP DNS request to a local DNS server so have to reject to be safe. Please report a bug to http://code.google.com/p/torsocks/issues/entry if this is preventing a program from working properly with torsocks
</pre>
