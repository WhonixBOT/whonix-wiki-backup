Applications such as ssh, gpg, wget, curl, git, apt-get are configured for stream isolation by default. The full list can be found [[Stream_Isolation#List|here]]. The advantage of this is that those will take different paths through the [[Tor]] network and will therefore be more anonymous.

This comes with a small usability issue in corner cases.

* For some tunnels you may need to disable stream isolation. (This is covered [[Tunnels/Introduction|Whonix tunnel documentation]].)
* Applications that require local connections will have to [[Stream_Isolation#Deactivate_Stream_Isolation|undo]] this setting. That would be for example the case if you wanted to open a local ssh listener.

When you run for example {{Code2|ssh 10.152.152.11}}, {{Code2|uwt}} will result in actually executing {{Code2|torsocks /usr/bin/ssh.anondist-orig 10.152.152.11}}. Therefore traffic will flow though {{Code2|torsocks}} and go a Tor {{Code2|SocksPort}}. This will fail for local connections. It will result in the following error message:

<pre>
libtorsocks(12021): connect: Connection is to a local address (10.152.152.11), may be a TCP DNS request to a local DNS server so have to reject to be safe. Please report a bug to http://code.google.com/p/torsocks/issues/entry if this is preventing a program from working properly with torsocks
</pre>
