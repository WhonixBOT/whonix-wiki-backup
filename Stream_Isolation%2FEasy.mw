Applications such as ssh, gpg, wget, curl, git, apt-get are configured for stream isolation by default. The full list can be found [[Stream_Isolation#List|here]]. The advantage of this is that those will take different paths through the [[Tor]] network and will therefore be more anonymous.

This comes with a small usability issue in corner cases. Applications that require local connections will have to [[Stream_Isolation#Deactivate_Stream_Isolation|undo]] this setting. That would be for example the case if you wanted to open a local ssh listener.
