= Why do you need anonymity? = <!--T:5-->

<!--T:6-->
As you are probably aware of, we currently find ourselves in a state of accelerated erosion of our freedoms and invasion of our privacy, with increasing levels of mass surveillance and repression all over the world (see [http://www.webcitation.org/6YXrRNshp this report from Privacy International]).

<!--T:7-->
Without taking any precautions, your Internet service provider, the State, the police, and global surveillance systems like [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHELON ECHELON] (which is '''not''' a conspiracy theory; see [http://www.fas.org/irp/program/process/rapport_echelon_en.pdf this report from the European Parliament]) can record what you do online: what you read, what you write, and with whom you communicate.

<!--T:8-->
This is possible since all messages sent over the Internet contain the [[Data_Collection_Techniques#IP_Address|IP addresses]] of both the sender and receiver, much like an ordinary mail sent through the postal system contains addresses of both sender and receiver for two-way communication. IP addresses can easily be traced back to the physical location of the computers and their owners, and from that ultimately back to you.

<!--T:9-->
If you do not mind this fact, then more power to you, but if you do mind, then Whonix might be just what you need.

<!--T:10-->
Moreover, just like with a postcard, any information traveling on the Internet can be read by the many computers that relay them.

<!--T:11-->
The Tor Project prepared a page [https://www.torproject.org/about/torusers.html.en Who uses Tor] in case you are interested.
