= The Importance of Anonymity = <!--T:5-->

<!--T:6-->
As the reader is probably aware, modern nation states are eroding our freedoms at an accelerated rate. The privacy of all global citizens is being steadily invaded with an extensive, mass surveillance network which has contributed to repressive activities (see [http://www.webcitation.org/6YXrRNshp this report from Privacy International]). Untold billions are under the constant scrutiny of domestic authoritative regimes and law enforcement; the hallmark features of a police state. 

<!--T:7-->
Unless precautions are taken, the Internet Service Provider and global surveillance systems like [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHELON ECHELON] can record everything done online: what the user reads, writes, and with whom they communicate. Only the ill-informed continue to believe this is a conspiracy theory, see [http://www.fas.org/irp/program/process/rapport_echelon_en.pdf this report from the European Parliament].

<!--T:8-->
Intimate tracking and profiling is possible since all messages and data sent over the Internet contain the [[Data_Collection_Techniques#IP_Address|IP addresses]] of both the sender and receiver. 

A suitable analogy is ordinary mail sent through the postal system which contains addresses of both the sender and receiver for two-way communication. IP addresses can be easily traced back to the physical location of the computers and their owners, ultimately identifying specific users. Moreover, just like with a postcard, any information traveling on the Internet can be read by the many computers that relay them.

If the reader does not mind this fact, then the thoughts of security and encryption expert Bruce Schneier may give cause for doubt: <ref>https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2006/05/the_eternal_value_of.html</ref>

<blockquote>
The most common retort against privacy advocates -- by those in favor of ID checks, cameras, databases, data mining and other wholesale surveillance measures -- is this line: "If you aren't doing anything wrong, what do you have to hide?"</blockquote>

<blockquote>Some clever answers: "If I'm not doing anything wrong, then you have no cause to watch me." "Because the government gets to define what's wrong, and they keep changing the definition." "Because you might do something wrong with my information." My problem with quips like these -- as right as they are -- is that they accept the premise that privacy is about hiding a wrong. It's not. Privacy is an inherent human right, and a requirement for maintaining the human condition with dignity and respect.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Two proverbs say it best: Quis custodiet custodes ipsos? ("Who watches the watchers?") and "Absolute power corrupts absolutely."</blockquote>

Edward Snowden shares a very similar view to Schneier: <ref>https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7308507-arguing-that-you-don-t-care-about-the-right-to-privacy</ref>

<blockquote>“Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.”</blockquote>

Ubiquitous surveillance has not only been proven to be ineffective, but it is extremely expensive. It also comes with a range of societal costs: broken political systems; unaccountable and secret government actions; surveillance outside of legally sanctioned limits; erosion of trust in commercial computer products, services and systems; the loss of liberty; and the embedding of systems which are prone to abuse. <ref>https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2014/01/how_the_nsa_threaten.html</ref>

For readers who do mind the rise and rise of blanket surveillance and the dangers it entails, Whonix might just be what is needed.

The Tor Project has prepared a page [https://www.torproject.org/about/torusers.html.en Who uses Tor] in case the reader is interested.
