The [http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ VLC Media Player] ([https://packages.debian.org/{{Stable_Whonix_based_on_Debian_codename}}/vlc Debian package]) is pre-installed in Whonix. Users do not face increased fingerprinting risks because [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1369309 VLC does not run Javascript]. <ref>However, unrestricted access to the large number of codecs, along with the gstreamer and ffmpeg frameworks can expose the system to remote attacks. The risk is greater than with Tor Browser because the latter attempts to restrict codecs to a particular subset. [https://www.videolan.org/vlc/privacy.html No cookies are stored by VLC and no information is collected and sent.] [https://forums.whonix.org/t/vlc-fingerprinting-research/4897/6 Original thread]</ref>

A word processor is included, along with spreadsheet and presentation applications.

To install it: <code>Start menu</code> -> <code>System</code> -> <code>Xfce Terminal</code>

{{Install_Package|package=

It can be used for many tasks; from booklets design to newspapers, magazines, newsletters and posters to technical documentation. 

Scribus has sophisticated page layout features like precision placing and rotating of text and/or images on a page, manual kerning of type, bezier curves polygons, precision placement of objects, layering with RGB and CMYK custom colors.

== scurl - SSL Command Line Downloader ==

To securely download files or webpages from the Internet on the command line, [[Secure_Downloads#Downloads_with_scurl_-_SSL_Command_Line_Downloader|scurl]] is pre-installed in Whonix. Users should preference scurl over wget, since scurl enforces strong encryption and is less buggy.

To invoke scurl to download a file, simply run (replace the https:// example with the actual file location).

{{CodeSelect|code=
scurl --remote-name https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/8.0.2/tor-browser-linux64-8.0.2_en-US.tar.xz  
}}

This will download <i>tor-browser-linux64-8.0.2_en-US.tar.xz</i> to the user's current working directory.

Refer to the [[Secure_Downloads#Downloads_with_scurl_-_SSL_Command_Line_Downloader|scurl]] entry for further examples and a complete description of this tool.
