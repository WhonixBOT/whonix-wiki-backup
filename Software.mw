== scurl - SSL command line downloader ==

To securely download files or webpages from the Internet on the command line, Whonix comes pre-installed with [[Secure_Downloads#Downloads_with_scurl_-_SSL_Command_Line_Downloader|scurl]]. Users should preference scurl over wget, since scurl enforces strong encryption and is not buggy.

To invoke scurl to download a file, simply run (replace the https:// example with the actual file location).

{{CodeSelect|code=
scurl --remote-name https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/6.5.2/tor-browser-linux64-6.5.2_en-US.tar.xz
}}

This will download <i>tor-browser-linux64-6.5.2_en-US.tar.xz</i> to the user's current working directory.

Refer to the [[Secure_Downloads#Downloads_with_scurl_-_SSL_Command_Line_Downloader|scurl]] entry for further examples and a complete description of this tool.

= Install Software in TemplateBasedVM =

[[Qubes|Qubes-Whonix]] only!

There is no reason to avoid installing software in [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/glossary/#templatebasedvm TemplateBasedVMs]. Although software installed using this method will not remain persistent across reboots. Users may opt to use a custom script to automate this process thereby minimizing time spent re-installing packages. 

==== Advantages ====

This method of installing software affords a single [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/glossary/#vm VM] many of the benefits of both TemplateBasedVMs and [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/glossary/#standalonevm StandaloneVMs].

*'''Centralized Updates''' - [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/glossary/#templatebasedvm AppVMs] are based on a [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/glossary/#templatebasedvm TemplateVM]. This means their root filesystem is based on the root filesystem of the corresponding template. Users need only update the TemplateVM and those updates will be reflected in TemplateBasedVM's root filesystem when the VM is restarted.<ref name="qubes-software">[https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/software-update-vm/ Qubes install software]</ref>

*'''Minimal Disk Usage''' - TemplateBasedVMs require much less disk space than StandaloneVMs. Since the AppVM's root filesystem is based the corresponding template. The AppVM only requires enough disk space to hold user files in the /home directory  

*'''Semi-Persistent Storage''' - User data stored in <code>/home</code> , <code>/rw</code> and <code>/usr/local</code> survives reboot. Many applications such as [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Signal signal] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_(software) wire] store user data in the <code>/home</code> folder. Since the custom script installs the software seamlessly with little to no user interaction. It gives the AppVM, in a sense <i>"quasi full persistence"</i> not unlike a StandaloneVMs full persistence.

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Qubes info box]]
| text       ='''Note:''' Although these instructions include the use of custom scripting. Writing this script is beyond the scope of these instructions. Users can find numerous free articles and instructions on the web using a search engine.   
}}

==== AppVM Preparation ====

1. Create an AppVM based on <code>whonix-ws</code>.

2. To speed up the repetitive software installation process. Users can pre-install any needed dependencies available from [https://packages.debian.org/stable/ packages.debian.org] in the TemplateVM. This is done so only packages or software missing from [https://packages.debian.org/stable packages.debian.org] would be repetitively installed in the AppVM.

3. Create a custom script that runs at VM start up. The purpose of this script is to automate software installation that would otherwise require manual completion. <i>Note:</i> The functionality of the script can vary greatly. This can be dependent on the software packages being installed along with the experience of the user.

Common tasks that scripting could be used to complete.  

* add the desired software repository
* add the verified signing key 
* update the package list with <code>apt-get update</code> after the repository and signing key are added 
* finally, the script would run <code>apt-get install <your-desired-software></code> 

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text       = '''Warning:''' Some users may be tempted to use the AppVM's root filesystem as a [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/software-update-vm/#note-on-treating-appvms-root-filesystem-non-persistence-as-a-security-feature non-persistent security feature]. However, malware may persist if the AppVM is infected since all data in the normal user filesystem, <code>/home</code> , <code>/rw</code> and <code>/usr/local</code> survives reboot. It is feasible that advanced malware (or malware specifically targeted at Qubes-based AppVMs) could install its hooks inside the user home directory files only. <ref name=print-qubes>[[https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/software-update-vm/#note-on-treating-appvms-root-filesystem-non-persistence-as-a-security-feature [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/software-update-vm/#note-on-treating-appvms-root-filesystem-non-persistence-as-a-security-feature]</ref>
}}

==== AppVM Use ====
Once preparation is complete. The user needs only to start the AppVM for the script to begine the process of installing software. Once this process is complete. The AppVM can be used as any other TemplateBasedVM. When the AppVM is shutdown. All data not in the users persistent <code>/home</code> folder, including the newly installed software packages is lost. However, a user needs only to start the VM to install the software packages once again.
 
=== Using bind-dirs Selective Persistance ===

* Using selective [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/bind-dirs/ bind-dirs] persistence is currently undocumented. Further research is required to ascertain which files require persistence across VM reboots. 
* This task would also be difficult.
