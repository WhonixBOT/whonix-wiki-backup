== On-screen Keyboard ==

[https://packages.debian.org/buster/florence Florence] is an extensible, scalable, virtual (on-screen) keyboard. <ref>[https://packages.debian.org/buster/florence Florence homepage]: <blockquote>It is useful when a real keyboard is unusable either because of a handicap, disease, broken keyboard or tablet PC; but when a pointing device is usable. Florence stays out of your way: it appears on the screen only when needed. An auto-click functionality also help people having difficulties to click buttons.</blockquote></ref>

The [http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ VLC Media Player] ([https://packages.debian.org/{{Stable_project_version_based_on_Debian_codename}}/vlc Debian package]) is pre-installed in {{project_name}}. There are no increased fingerprinting risks because [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1369309 VLC does not run Javascript]. <ref>However, unrestricted access to the large number of codecs, along with the gstreamer and ffmpeg frameworks can expose the system to remote attacks. The risk is greater than with Tor Browser because the latter attempts to restrict codecs to a particular subset. [https://www.videolan.org/vlc/privacy.html No cookies are stored by VLC and no information is collected and sent to third parties]; see the [https://forums.whonix.org/t/vlc-fingerprinting-research/4897/6 Original Whonix forum thread].</ref>

== Printing and Scanning ==

See [[Printing and Scanning]].

== Publishing ==

[http://www.scribus.net/ Scribus] ([https://packages.debian.org/{{Stable_project_version_based_on_Debian_codename}}/scribus Debian package]) is an open source desktop page layout accessible from the desktop menu (<code>Applications</code> → <code>Graphics</code>). It can be used for many tasks; from booklets design to newspapers, magazines, newsletters and posters to technical documentation. 

Scribus has sophisticated page layout features like precision placing and rotating of text and/or images on a page, manual kerning of type, bezier curves polygons, precision placement of objects, layering with RGB and CMYK custom colors. The Scribus document file format is XML-based. Unlike proprietary binary file formats, even damaged documents can be recovered with a simple text editor.

== scurl: SSL Command Line Downloader ==

To securely download files or webpages from the Internet on the command line, [[Secure_Downloads#Downloads_with_scurl_-_SSL_Command_Line_Downloader|scurl]] is pre-installed in {{project_name}}. scurl should be preferred over wget, since the former enforces strong encryption and is less buggy.

To invoke scurl to download a file, use the following syntax and replace the example URL with the file's location.

{{CodeSelect|code=
scurl --remote-name https://dist.torproject.org/torbrowser/9.5/tor-browser-linux64-9.5_en-US.tar.xz  
}}

This will download <i>tor-browser-linux64-9.5_en-US.tar.xz</i> to the current working directory.

Refer to the [[Secure_Downloads#Downloads_with_scurl_-_SSL_Command_Line_Downloader|scurl]] entry for further examples and a complete description of this tool.
