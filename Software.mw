== Printing and Scanning ==

Printing is risky. This is not a Whonix related issue. It is a general issue with printers.

Quotes from eff.org<ref>https://www.eff.org/issues/printers</ref>:

<blockquote>
Imagine that every time you printed a document it automatically included a secret code that could be used to identify the printer - and potentially the person who used it. Sounds like something from an episode of "Alias" right?
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Unfortunately the scenario isn't fictional.
</blockquote>

Modern printers and scanners are embedded computers with their own dedicated internal storage. It has been discovered that scanned documents are saved by these devices, leaking sensitive documents. <ref>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2017/01/photocopier_sec.html</ref> The next best workaround is to use cell phone for  a dedicated to anonymous activities to take photos of the material but make sure you understand the [[caveats|Surfing_Posting_Blogging#Anonymous_Photo_Sharing]].

Another non-technical issue with anonymous printing nowadays is forensics like hand fingerprints, DNA traces, etc.

== scurl - SSL command line downloader ==
'''Advanced users.'''

Pre-installed.

It's a simple wrapper around curl. {{Code|/usr/bin/scurl}} simply adds <code>{{Curl Secure}}</code> to all runs of curl. It also has [[Stream Isolation]] in Whonix, because {{Code|/usr/bin/curl}} is an {{Code|uwt wrapper}} symlinked to {{Code|/usr/lib/whonix/uwtwrapper}} which will ultimately run {{Code|/usr/bin/curl.real}}.

To invoke it.
{{CodeSelect|code=
scurl https://check.torproject.org</pre>
}}

All other curl/linux features continue to work, such as.

{{CodeSelect|code=
scurl https://check.torproject.org > index.html
}}

To store the output inside a file.

{{CodeSelect|code=
scurl http://check.torproject.org
}}

Will result as expected in.

<pre>curl: (1) Protocol http not supported or disabled in libcurl</pre>

Same for.

{{CodeSelect|code=
scurl check.torproject.org
}}

Will result as expected in.

<pre>curl: (1) Protocol http not supported or disabled in libcurl</pre>

Running it against an self-signed or invalid SSL certificate.

{{CodeSelect|code=
scurl https://www.debian-administration.org
}}

Will result in an error, for example.

<pre>
curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: self signed certificate
More details here: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html

curl performs SSL certificate verification by default, using a "bundle"
 of Certificate Authority (CA) public keys (CA certs). If the default
 bundle file isn't adequate, you can specify an alternate file
 using the --cacert option.
If this HTTPS server uses a certificate signed by a CA represented in
 the bundle, the certificate verification probably failed due to a
 problem with the certificate (it might be expired, or the name might
 not match the domain name in the URL).
If you'd like to turn off curl's verification of the certificate, use
 the -k (or --insecure) option.
