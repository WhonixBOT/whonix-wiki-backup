== Printing and Scanning ==

Printing is risky.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printer_steganography</ref> This is not a Whonix related issue. It is a general issue with printers. 

Quotes from eff.org<ref>https://www.eff.org/issues/printers</ref>:

<blockquote>
Imagine that every time you printed a document it automatically included a secret code that could be used to identify the printer - and potentially the person who used it. Sounds like something from an episode of "Alias" right?
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Unfortunately the scenario is not fictional.
</blockquote>

The codes can be deciphered with a [https://w2.eff.org/Privacy/printers/docucolor/docucolor.cgi program] from the EFF.<ref>https://w2.eff.org/Privacy/printers/docucolor/</ref>

Workarounds for printing political leaflets safely:

*For a list of printers that do or don't include forensic watermarking check this [https://www.eff.org/pages/list-printers-which-do-or-do-not-display-tracking-dots page].

*According to MIT, the dots are not present in Black-and-White print-outs.<ref>http://seeingyellow.com/</ref> (as long as there is no color cartridge present)

*Using a USB-Printer bought at a garage sale might thus be a good option.


Note this applies to printers under your own control only. If you use a printer controlled by an adversary who wants to track down the source printer, they can still enforce color printing at all times for this very reason. 


Modern printers and scanners are embedded computers with their own dedicated internal storage. It has been discovered that scanned documents are saved by these devices, leaking sensitive documents. <ref>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2017/01/photocopier_sec.html</ref> The next best workaround is to use cell phone for  a dedicated to anonymous activities to take photos of the material but make sure you understand the [[Surfing_Posting_Blogging#Anonymous_Photo_Sharing|caveats]].

Another non-technical issue with anonymous printing nowadays is forensics like hand fingerprints, DNA traces, etc.

== scurl - SSL command line downloader ==

To securely download files or webpages from the Internet on the command line, Whonix comes pre-installed with [[Secure_Downloads#Downloads_with_scurl_-_SSL_Command_Line_Downloader|scurl]]. Users should preference scurl over wget, since scurl enforces strong encryption and is not buggy.

To invoke scurl to download a file, simply run (replace the https:// example with the actual file location).

{{CodeSelect|code=
scurl --remote-name https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/6.5.2/tor-browser-linux64-6.5.2_en-US.tar.xz
}}

This will download <i>tor-browser-linux64-6.5.2_en-US.tar.xz</i> to the user's current working directory.

Refer to the [[Secure_Downloads#Downloads_with_scurl_-_SSL_Command_Line_Downloader|scurl]] entry for further examples and a complete description of this tool.
