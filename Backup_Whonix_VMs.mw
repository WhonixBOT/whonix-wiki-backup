= Overview - Ways to Backup Whonix VMs =
There isn't a great and simple way to make backups yet. Best you can do is either:

* [[File Transfer]]
* and/or use the export feature of Virtual Box, that will create standalone .ova files which you should be able to easily import on any other machine and/or
* Create a copy of your VM files. There is some important knowledge you have to be aware of, this is documented below.

= General Important Recommendation =
Creating backups is only the first step. You should do a test run if you are actually to restore your backup. Otherwise you may experience a nasty surprise that some files are missing for successful restore.

= Important Knowledge =
== ~/VirtualBox VMs Folder ==
If you want to copy your Virtual Box's to another harddrive, only creating a backup of your "~/VirtualBox VMs" folder won't suffice. You have to remember to have a backup of your Virtual Box settings folder (~/.VirtualBox) as well, because manually re-creating that folder is difficult and undocumented by Virtual Box's documentation.

== Using Virtual Box's VM Cloning Feature for Backups isn't Simple ==
The clone feature of Virtual Box is not very user friendly for backups for the same reason as above. It works, for cloning VMs, but it's not very useful for easy backups, because general VM settings are still stored in your home folder (~/.VirtualBox) and these are difficult to restore as mentioned above. So if you use the clone feature and backup your VMs on a different harddrive, you have to remember to have a backup of your Virtual Box settings folder (~/.VirtualBox) as well.

== Backup Virtual Box Settings Files ==
Turn off Virtual Box before attempting to backup the Virtual Box's settings folder (~/.VirtualBox).

When you change VM settings, add/remove VMs, add/remove virtual hdds, add/remove snapshots you should create a new backup.

= Advanced Users =
Adding your Virtual Box settings folder to a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control revision control system] such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software) git] is a good additions to backups of Virtual Box's settings folder. Should Virtual Box damage your settings file and its backup file (happens sometimes), you can try a recent backup from an earlier git revision.
