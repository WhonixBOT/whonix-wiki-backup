= How to decide which apps come with Whonix? =
Overall: not killing the project for being badmouthed by The Tor Project and/or geeks due to bad decisions.
 
The following numbers are not referring to priorities, just to reference them. '''Not written in stone!'''

# There must be a reliable upgrade path. Stuff that is in Debian is perfect.
# Upgrading must not eat up Whonix maintainer's time to keep Whonix maintainable.
# If the applications issues network activity, there must be a way to properly configure it for [[Stream Isolation]], to keep Tor's TransPort clean for the user's own stuff.
# When downloading applications, especially since downloads run over Tor, strong verification must be supported (Ex: OpenPGP, apt-get does that well.) or be so trivial that some trusted devs can audit the code for being not intentionally malicious.
# Must be Tor-safe. (Definition: must not be totally [[DoNot#Do_not_confuse_Anonymity_with_Pseudonymity.|pseudonymous]]. No major protocol leaks. For example, using Tor Browser instead of Firefox and recommending Thunderbird/TorBirdy and not some other client.)
# Must be Free Software / Open Source.
# Must not be a total security disaster.
# Must not issue network activity while the application is not in use.
# Installation/modification must not limit discussion about Whonix to the controversy of that application. (Ex: [[FAQ#Does_Whonix_modify_Tor.3F|No Tor modifications.]])
# Installing it by default in Whonix must not totally f*ck up The Tor Project.

Lesser:

* We must believe that a fair amount of users likes it.
* We must believe that it's usable by a fair amount of users.
* Mature behaving and communicative upstream, not important if the application/script is trivial and maintenance is simple.

Examples:

a) There is no BitCoin client installed by default in Whonix, because no gui client was available in Debian stable at time of release. Shipping a manually installed one by default would be nightmare, because users wouldn't know how it was installed and not update it. Updating would be left to the user. It is better if the whole process download, verification, install, upgrade notification and upgrade is up to the user.

b) There is no Email client installed by default in Whonix, because no Tor-safe client (Thunderbird + TorBirdy) was available in Debian stable at time of release.

c) There is no torrent client installed by default in Whonix, because we know of none fulfills 3. If one has been found, this topic has to be brought up on tor-talk mailing list, asking for their official position, due to [[File_Sharing#Updates|contradictory prior statements]] to fulfill 10.

= Package Source =
Generally... packages.debian.org gives us:

* always stable, not breaking stable, a maintainer testing the package with Debian
* some vetting that the package does not contain an obvious backdoor
*  easily installable without much long term time sunk from developer side, just add once to anon-meta-packages and be done with it
* no extra repository signing keys (that have the ability to replace any package on the system), if we theoretically added something like deb.gnunet.org, if they were compromised, all Whonix users would be compromised at once through an malicious upgrade. That's how Debian works. All packages have full system access. No sandboxing.
* no need for to follow up on security issues of the package, no quick security fix uploads, all done by Debian.
*  no time sunk as in reuploading new packages to deb.whonix.org.
** no download from the vendors website
** no verification of signature from the vendors website
** no upload / install test from developers repository [a broken package could break the whole system, not in malicious ways, but for example broken connectivity that cannot be restored without hacking command into a console]
** no upload / install test from testers repository, have more people try to run into such issues
** no migrate to stable repository
** no remember the state, bug reports, look if it was actually tested of the whole thing
** it's not very difficult technically, but demanding on mental resources and time, without a dedicated release manager, it's better to pick to pick fewer "special" packages from other sources than packages.debian.org

Tor from deb.torproject.org as well as Tor Browser is a tedious enough task.

In summary, there are issues with security as well as maintenance overhead.
