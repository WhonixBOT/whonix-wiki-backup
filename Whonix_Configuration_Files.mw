= .d Style Configuration Folders =
When you are editing configuration files, when available, it is recommended to prefer editing {{Code2|.d style}} configuration folders to avoid the [[#Ordinary_Configuration_Files|disadvantage of ordinary configuration files]].

This applies to {{project_name}} as well as most, if not all, other Debian based Linux distributions.

Most of {{project name}} packages provide flexible {{Code2|.d style}} configuration folders that work like other {{Code2|.d style}} configuration folders.

* {{Code|/etc/whonix.d}}
* {{Code|/etc/whonix_firewall.d}}
* {{Code|/etc/controlportfilt.d}} (Only up to {{gateway_product_name}} 9.)
* {{Code|/etc/cpfpy.d}} (Only on {{gateway_product_name}} 10 and above.)
* {{Code|/etc/whonix_buildconfig.d}} (Only if you build from source code.)
* {{Code|/etc/sdwdate.d}}
* {{Code|/etc/uwt.d}}

We'll explain it using an example. For example, {{Code|/etc/whonix_firewall.d/30_default.conf}} says.

<pre>
## Please use "/etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_user.conf" for your custom configuration,
## which will override the defaults found here. When {{project_name}} is updated, this 
## file may be overwritten.
</pre>

The same in other words.

<pre>
## Instead of editing this file, please create and use the file
## "/etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_user.conf". When {{project_name}} is updated, 
## "/etc/whonix_firewall.d/30_default.conf" will be overwritten. Files in folder 
## "/etc/whonix_firewall.d/" are sourced in alphabetical order. Anything in 
## "/etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_user.conf" will always override the defaults,
## allowing the user to keep their settings after updating Whonix.
</pre>

The same yet in other words... Files in {{Code|.d}} folders are usually sourced in lexical order. That means, files named {{Code|30_...}} will always get overruled by files named {{Code|50_...}}.

For example, directly editing {{Code|/etc/whonix_firewall.d/30_default.conf}} is recommended against. This is because, next time {{project_name}} gets updated, {{Code|/etc/whonix_firewall.d/30_default}} may get new settings and improved settings. You would end up with an {{Code2|dpkg interactive conflict resolution dialog}}, which would for example look the following.

<pre>
Configuration file `/etc/whonix_firewall.d/30_default.conf'
 ==> Modified (by you or by a script) since installation.
 ==> Package distributor has shipped an updated version.
   What would you like to do about it ?  Your options are:
    Y or I  : install the package maintainer's version
    N or O  : keep your currently-installed version
      D     : show the differences between the versions
      Z     : background this process to examine the situation
 The default action is to keep your current version.
*** interfaces (Y/I/N/O/D/Z) [default=N] ? N
</pre>

Modifications coming with {{project_name}} will always fall back to reasonable defaults, if you were still using an old version. However, to prevent such conflicts in the first place, you're better off reading {{Code|/etc/whonix_firewall.d/30_default.conf}}, leaving {{Code|/etc/whonix_firewall.d/30_default.conf}} untouched, copying settings you wish to overrule from {{Code|/etc/whonix_firewall.d/30_default.conf}} and pasting them into {{Code|/etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_user.conf}}.

= Ordinary Configuration Files =
There is something you should be aware of when editing ordinary, {{Code2|<u>non</u>-.d style}} configuration files. This applies to {{project_name}} as well as most, if not all, other Debian based Linux distributions.

We'll explain it using an example. Let's take for example {{Code|/etc/hdparm.conf}}.

There is no {{Code2|/etc/hdparm.d}} folder. Therefore, if you want to make changes, your only option is to edit {{Code|/etc/hdparm.conf}}. But this comes with a disadvantage. Next time this file gets changed by the {{Code2|hdparm}} maintainer and you upgrade your system, you would end up with an {{Code2|dpkg interactive conflict resolution dialog}}, which would for example look the following.

{{Anchor|dpkg interactive conflict resolution dialog}}
<pre>
Configuration file `/etc/hdparm.conf'
 ==> Modified (by you or by a script) since installation.
 ==> Package distributor has shipped an updated version.
   What would you like to do about it ?  Your options are:
    Y or I  : install the package maintainer's version
    N or O  : keep your currently-installed version
      D     : show the differences between the versions
      Z     : background this process to examine the situation
 The default action is to keep your current version.
*** interfaces (Y/I/N/O/D/Z) [default=N] ? N
</pre>

Check the differences ({{Code|D}}), then make a decision. If you know you made changes to that file, you most likely want to keep them, i.e. select {{Code|N}}. If you are unsure, after the upgrade finished, check again that config file and re-apply your settings if necessary.
