= Introduction =

It is possible for users to significantly harden their Whonix and/or host platform. This reduces the likelihood of a temporary or persistent compromise, while increasing the chances of successful, anonymous activity.  Hardening is dependent upon a user's skill set, motivation and available hardware. The checklist below is intended to provide a quick overview of important issues, categorized by difficulty level - easy, moderate, difficult and expert.

= Easy =

== Anonymous Blogging, Posting, Chat, Email and File Sharing ==

* To remain anonymous, follow all the [[Surfing_Posting_Blogging|Whonix recommendations]] to minimize threats of keyboard/mouse biometrics, [[Surfing_Posting_Blogging#Stylometry|stylometric analysis]] and other covert channels.
* Remove [[metadata|metadata]] from documents, pictures, videos or other files before uploading them to the Internet.
* Think twice before sharing [[Surfing_Posting_Blogging#Photographs|"anonymous" photos]] due to unique embedded noise signatures that have no known countermeasures.
* Be careful sharing [[Surfing_Posting_Blogging#Documents|anonymous documents]]. Digital watermarks with embedded covert data are robust, so run documents through Optical Character Recognition (OCR) before sharing the output.
* Utilize [[Onionshare|OnionShare]] to share or receive files securely and anonymously over the Tor network.

== Disabling and Minimizing Hardware Risks ==

* In [[{{q_project_name_short}}|{{q_project_name}}]], only use a mouse and keyboard utilizing PS/2 ports (not USB ports) to prevent [https://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.fr/2011/06/usb-security-challenges.html malicious compromise] of dom0 (PS/2 adapters and available controllers are required).
* Do not enable audio input to any VM unless strictly required and consider [[Hardware_Threat_Minimization#Microphones|disabling microphones]] where possible (muting on the host) or unplugging external devices.
* Preferably [[Hardware_Threat_Minimization#Webcams|detach or cover webcams]] unless they are in use. In [[{{q_project_name_short}}|{{q_project_name}}]], assign it to an untrusted VM (if needed).
* Avoid using [[Hardware_Threat_Minimization#Wireless_Input_Devices|wireless devices]], since they are insecure.
* Preferably disable or remove [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth#History_of_security_concerns Bluetooth hardware modules].
* Disable or remove [[Protection_Against_Physical_Attacks#Problematic_Interfaces|problematic devices]] like ExpressCard, PCMCIA, FireWire or Thunderbolt which may allow attackers with physical access to read RAM.
* Apply [[Firmware_Security_and_Updates#Firmware_Updating_and_Security_Problems|CPU microcode updates]] on the host operating system <ref>This applies to both Intel and AMD architecture.</ref> or baremetal configurations like [[Physical_Isolation|Physical Isolation]]. <ref>While this may introduce new vulnerabilities, this is objectively better than running a system that is vulnerable to known attacks.</ref>

== File Handling ==

{{mbox
| type      = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text       = {{q_project_name}} only.
}}

* In File Manager, disable previews of files from untrusted sources. Change file preferences in the TemplateVM's File Manager so future AppVMs inherit this feature.
* Files received or downloaded from untrusted sources (the internet, via email etc.) should not be opened in a trusted VM. Instead, open them in a DisposableVM: <code>Right-click</code> -> <code>Open In DisposableVM</code>
* Untrusted PDFs should be opened in a DisposableVM or converted into a [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-app-linux-pdf-converter trusted (sanitized) PDF] to prevent exploitation of the PDF reader and potential infection of the VM.

== Mandatory Access Control ==

* Enable all available [[AppArmor|apparmor profiles]] in the {{workstation_product_name}} and {{gateway_product_name}} TemplateVMs.
* Enable [[{{gateway product name short}}_Security#Seccomp|seccomp]] on Whonix-Gateway (<code>sys-whonix</code> ProxyVM).

== Passwords and Logins ==

* Use strong, unique and random [[Passwords|passwords]] for all online accounts, system logins and encryption / decryption purposes to prevent the feasibility of brute-forcing attacks.
* Use a trusted [https://www.keepassx.org/ password manager], so hundreds of different passwords can be kept stored in an encrypted password database, protected by one strong master password. <ref>For greater security, store the password manager off-line.</ref>
* For high-entropy passwords, consider using [[Passwords#Generating_Unbreakable_Passwords|Diceware passphrases]]. <ref>To [[Passwords#Diceware_Password_Strength|estimate strength]], an 8-word Diceware passphrase provides ~90 bits of entropy, while a 10-word passphrase provides ~128 bits of entropy.</ref>
* In [[{{q_project_name_short}}|{{q_project_name}}]], store all login credentials and passwords in an offline vault VM (preferably with KeyPassX) and securely cut and paste them into the Tor Browser. <ref>For greater safety, copy something else into the clipboard after pasting so the password is purged and cannot be accidentally pasted elsewhere.</ref>
* Read and follow all the [[Passwords#Principles_for_Stronger_Passwords|principles for stronger passwords]].

== Secure Downloads ==

* Download Internet files [[Secure_Downloads|securely]] using <i>scurl</i> instead of <i>wget</i> from the command line.
* When downloading with Tor Browser, [[Tor_Browser#Preventing_SSLStrip_Attacks|prevent SSLstrip attacks]] by typing <code>https://</code> links directly into the URL / address bar. 
* Prefer [[Tor_Browser#Other_Precautions|onion services]] file downloads, which provide greater security and anonymity than https.

== Secure Qubes Operation ==

{{mbox
| type      = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text       = {{q_project_name}} only.
}}

* Refer to the [[Qubes-Whonix_Security|{{q_project_name}} security recommendations]] and always follow the [https://www.qubes-os.org/news/ latest security news] and [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/security-guidelines/ advice] from the Qubes team.

== Secure Software Installation ==

* Default to Debian's [[Install_Software#Prefer_APT|official package manager APT]] for installing software, and [[Install_Software#Avoid_Third_Party_Package_Managers|avoid third party package managers]].
* When possible, use mechanisms which simplify and automate software upgrades and installations, like <i>apt-get</i> functions.
* Prefer installation of software from [[Install_Software#Prefer_Packages_from_Debian_Stable_Repository|signed (Debian) GNU/Linux repositories]] and avoid [[Install_Software#Avoid_Manual_Software_Installation|manually installing software]], particularly if it is unsigned.
* Set the Qubes, Debian and Whonix package updates to [[Onionizing_Repositories#Qubes_Packages|Tor onion service repositories]]. <ref>The Whonix and Debian repositories are no longer set to onion mirrors by default due to stability issues. This decision will be reviewed in the future once v3 onions have further matured.</ref>
* For safer installations or updates, first [[Install_Software#How-to:_Install_or_Update_with_Utmost_Caution|stop all activity/applications and rotate the Tor circuits]].
* Always [[Verifying_Software_Signatures|verify key fingerprints and digital signatures of signed software]] before importing keys or installing software.

== Tor Browser Series and Settings ==

* Consider using the Tor Browser alpha series. It provides additional [https://www.ics.uci.edu/~perl/pets16_selfrando.pdf Selfrando] (load-time memory randomization) protection. <ref>Selfrando provides a significant security improvement over standard address space layout randomization (ASLR) present in Tor Browser and other browsers. Selfrando is incompatible with grsecurity kernels. Due to this resolved [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/20683 bug], Selfrando has been integrated into the alpha series from 7.0a4 onward.</ref> <ref>The "hardened" Tor Browser series has been deprecated, see: https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/21912</ref> <ref>Following the official release of the v8.0+ Tor Browser series (based on Firefox 60 ESR), the stable and alpha Tor Browser versions both have a [https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Sandbox native sandbox].</ref>
* Run the [[Tor_Browser#Security_Slider|Tor Browser Security Slider]] in the highest position. <ref>This may affect usability and proper functioning on some websites.</ref>
* [https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#TBBJavaScriptEnabled Disable Javascript] by default and [[Tor_Browser#Security_vs_Usability_Trade-off|only allow it sparingly]] for trusted sites. <ref>This is more secure, but increases the user's fingerprinting risk due to selective use of Javascript.</ref>
* Do not configure [[Tor_Browser#NoScript_Custom_Setting_Persistence|custom NoScript (per-site) settings]] which persist across successive Tor Browser sessions because this aids fingerprinting.
* Use [https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en <i>.onion</i> services] where possible to stay within the Tor network, such as defaulting searches to the [https://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/ DuckDuckGo onion service].
* Use [[Tor_Browser#Multiple_Tor_Browser_Instances_and_Whonix-Workstations|multiple Tor Browser instances or Whonix-Workstations]] to better compartmentalize contextual identities.
* Follow all other [[Tor_Browser#Unsafe_Tor_Browser_Habits|Whonix recommendations for safe]] and [[DoNot|anonymous]] use of [[Tor_Browser|Tor Browser]].
* [[Install_Tor_Browser_Outside_of_Whonix|Install Tor Browser outside of Whonix]] so a second, working instance is always available for anonymous activities. <ref>Thereby circumventing any possible future problems, like the breakage of Whonix.</ref>

== VirtualBox ==

{{mbox
| type      = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text       = {{non_q_project_name_short}} Only.
}}

* Remove a host of [[Virtualization_Platform_Security#VirtualBox_Hardening|VirtualBox features]] to reduce the attack surface.
* Take regular, clean [[{{workstation product name short}}_Security#VM_Snapshots|VM snapshots]] that are not used for any activities.
* Spoof the initial [[Network_Time_Synchronization#Spoof_the_Initial_Virtual_Hardware_Clock_Offset|virtual hardware clock offset]].

= Moderate =

== Create a USB Qube ==

{{mbox
| type      = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text       = {{q_project_name}} only.
}}

* Prepare and utilize a [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/usb/ USB qube]. <ref>A USB qube is automatically created as of Qubes R4.0</ref> <ref>USB keyboards and mice expose dom0 to attacks, and all USB devices are potential [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack side channel attack vectors].</ref>

== Host Operating System Distribution ==

{{mbox
| type      = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text       = {{non_q_project_name_short}} only.
}}

* For a truly private operating system, install [[Host_Operating_System_Selection|GNU/Linux]] on the host. <ref>[https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-microsoft.html Windows] and [https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-apple.en.html macOS] are surveillance platforms that do not respect user freedom or privacy.</ref>
* The [[Host_Operating_System_Selection#Recommended_GNU.2FLinux_Distribution|Debian distribution]] is recommended by Whonix as providing a reasonable balance of security and usability.

== Host Operating System Hardening ==

=== All Platforms ===

* Use [[Full_Disk_Encryption_and_Encrypted_Images#Full_Disk_Encryption_on_the_Host|Full Disk Encryption (FDE)]] on the host.
* Apply a [[Protection_Against_Physical_Attacks#BIOS_Password|BIOS password]] for BIOS setup and boot.
* [[General_Host_Security#Torify_apt-get_Traffic|Torrify apt-get traffic]] on the host to prevent fingerprinting and leakage of sensitive security information.
* Follow all other Whonix recommendations to [[General_Host_Security#Key_Hardening_Steps|further harden the host OS]] against [[Protection_Against_Physical_Attacks|physical attacks]].

=== {{non_q_project_name_short}} Only ===

* [[Operating_System_Hardening#Harden_Debian|Harden]] the host Debian Linux OS.

== Networking ==

=== All Platforms ===
* If possible, use a [[Host_Firewall#Dedicated_Connection|dedicated network connection]] (LAN, WiFi etc.) that is not shared with other potentially compromised computers.
* If using a shared network via a common cable modem/router or ADSL router, configure a [[General_Host_Security#DMZ|de-militarized zone]] (perimeter network). <ref>This restricts Whonix-Gateway accessibility to/from other nodes on the network e.g. printers, phones and laptops.</ref>
* Test the [[Host_Firewall#Port_Scan|LAN's router/firewall]] with either an internet port scanning service or preferably a port scanning application from an external IP address.
* Change the default administration password on the router to a unique, random, and suitably long [[Passwords#Generating_Unbreakable_Passwords|Diceware passphrase]] to prevent bruteforcing attacks.
* WiFi users should default to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Access WPA2-AES standard] which provides the safest protocol and strongest encryption. <ref>Do not rely on WiFi Protected Set-up (WPS), which has [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Setup major security flaws].</ref>
* Follow all other Whonix recommendations to [[Router_and_Local_Area_Network_Security#Recommended_Router_Settings|lock down the router]].

=== {{q_project_name}} Only ===
* Prefer the Debian Template for networking (<code>sys-net</code> and <code>sys-firewall</code>) since it is [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/1781 minimal in nature] and does not "ping home", unlike the Fedora Template. <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/disable-sys-net-pings-to-fedoraproject-org/1952</ref>
* Consider using customized [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/templates/fedora-minimal/ minimal templates] for NetVMs to reduce the attack surface.
* For greater security, higher performance and a lower resource footprint, consider using an experimental [https://github.com/talex5/qubes-mirage-firewall MirageOS-based unikernel firewall] that can run as a QubesOS ProxyVM.

== Newer Kernels ==

* Consider installing newer kernels in [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/software-update-dom0/ Qubes-Whonix] or the [https://wiki.debian.org/KernelFAQ host Linux platform] to benefit from additional protections (including [https://www.grsecurity.net/ grsecurity elements]) being mainlined by the [http://kernsec.org/wiki/index.php/Kernel_Self_Protection_Project Kernel Self Protection Project]. <ref>This recommendation comes with a warning: cutting-edge kernels may destabilize the system or cause boot failures.</ref>

== Sandboxing ==

* Use [[{{workstation product name short}}_Security#Firejail|Firejail]] to restrict Tor Browser, Firefox-ESR, VLC and other regularly used applications. <ref>Previously The Tor Project's [[Deprecated#Sandboxed_Tor_Browser|alpha sandbox]] was recommended to restrict Tor Browser, but [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/25540 the project has unfortunately been abandoned].</ref>

== Spoof MAC Addresses ==

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = '''Tip:''' [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_spoofing MAC spoofing] is only necessary if traveling with your laptop or PC. It is not required for home PCs that do not change locations.
}}

* In [[{{q_project_name_short}}|{{q_project_name}}]], [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/anonymizing-your-mac-address/ follow these steps] to spoof the MAC address on the Debian or Fedora TemplateVM used for network connections.
* In [[{{non_q_project_name_short}}|{{non_q_project_name}}]], follow [[MAC_Address#Changing_MAC_Addresses|these steps]] to spoof the MAC address of the network card on a Linux, Windows or macOS host.

== Time Stamps and NTP Clients ==

{{mbox
| type      = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text       = {{non_q_project_name_short}} only.
}}

* [[Disable_TCP_and_ICMP_Timestamps#Disable_ICMP_Timestamps|Disable ICMP timestamps]] and [[Disable_TCP_and_ICMP_Timestamps#Disable_TCP_Timestamps|TCP timestamps]] on the host operating system to prevent leakage of information. <ref>Such as system information, host time, system uptime, and fingerprinting of devices behind a router.</ref>
* [[Time_Attacks#Mitigations|Uninstall the NTP client]] on the host operating system and disable systemd's timdatectl NTP synchronization feature. <ref>This prevents time-related attack vectors which rely on leakage of the host time.</ref>

== Tor Settings ==

* Consider enabling [[{{gateway product name short}}_Security#Tor_Connection_Padding|Tor connection padding]] for greater anonymity.
* Consider installing [[Tor_Versioning|newer Tor versions]] via the Whonix stable-proposed-updates repository or directly from The Tor Project repository.
* Avoid [[Tor_Entry_Guards#Regenerate_the_Tor_State_After_Saving_the_Tor_State_Folder|regenerating the Tor state file]] or [[Tor_Entry_Guards#Manual_Rotation_of_Tor_Guards|manually rotating Tor guards]] <ref>Via creation of a new Whonix-Gateway (<code>sys-whonix</code>).</ref> because it degrades anonymity.
* Avoid configuring [[Tor_Entry_Guards#Fresh_Tor_Entry_Guards_by_Regenerating_the_Tor_State_File|non-persistent entry guards]], as this ''severely'' degrades anonymity.
* Consider using [[Bridges]] if Tor is censored, dangerous or deemed suspicious in your location.
* If using a bridge, configure [[Tor_Entry_Guards#Alternating_Bridges|alternating bridges]] for different physical locations.
* Heavily censored users should configure a ''meek-azure'' bridge with [[Anon_Connection_Wizard|Anon Connection Wizard]]. <ref>For example, Whonix users residing in China.</ref>
* To help preserve anonymity, copy [[Tor_Entry_Guards#Copy_Tor_Configuration_files_and_Settings_to_Another_sys-whonix_Instance|Tor configuration files and settings]] to any new <code>sys-whonix</code> instance which is created. <ref>This is useful when testing later Whonix releases to stymie deanonymization attempts by advanced adversaries, or when creating an identical backup that does not share any other persistent data, except for Tor state and custom torrc options.</ref>

== Whonix VM Security ==

* Consider disabling the [[{{gateway product name short}}_Security_Hardening#Disable_Control_Port_Filter_Proxy|Control Port Filter Proxy]] to reduce the attack surface of both the {{gateway_product_name}} and {{workstation_product_name}}.
* On Whonix-Workstation, consider [[{{project name short}}check_Hardening|hardening whonixcheck]].
* Consider enabling the [[{{workstation product name short}}_Security_Hardening#Second_Optional_.28Extra.29_Firewall|optional (extra) Whonix-Workstation firewall]].

= Difficult =

== Anti-Evil Maid ==

{{mbox
| type      = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text       = {{q_project_name}} only.
}}

* If a Trusted Platform Module is available, use [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/anti-evil-maid/ AEM protection] to attest that only desired (trusted) components are loaded and executed during the system boot. <ref>Unauthorized modifications to BIOS or the boot partition will be notified.</ref>

== Chaining Anonymizing Tunnels ==

* Avoid this course of action. The [[Tunnels/Introduction|anonymity benefits are unproven]] and it may actually hurt a user's anonymity and security goals.

== DisposableVMs ==

{{mbox
| type      = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text       = {{q_project_name}} only.
}}

* Run all instances of Tor Browser in a [[Qubes/Disposable_VM|DisposableVM]] which is preferably uncustomized to resist fingerprinting. <ref>This is safe in Qubes R4, but [https://phabricator.whonix.org/T695 privacy issues] are unresolved in Qubes R3.2</ref>
* Configure each ServiceVM as a [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/dispvm-customization/#using-static-disposable-vms-for-sys- Static DisposableVM] to mitigate the threat from persistent malware accross VM reboots. <ref>Users may configure <code>sys-net</code>, <code>sys-firewall</code> and <code>sys-usb</code> as static DisposableVMs. This option is only available for Qubes R4 users.</ref>

== Email ==

=== All Platforms ===

* Follow the [[E-Mail#Email_Provider_Comparison|Whonix recommendations]] to select an email provider compatible with privacy and anonymity.
* For [[E-Mail#Encrypted_Email|anonymous PGP-encrypted email]] over Tor, use [[Encrypted_Email_with_Thunderbird_and_Enigmail|Mozilla Thunderbird, Enigmail and TorBirdy]]. <ref>Reminder: The ''Subject:'' line and other header fields are <u>not</u> encrypted in the current configuration.</ref>
* Follow all other [[E-Mail#Safe_Email_Principles|email principles for greater safety]].

=== {{q_project_name}} Only ===

* Use [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/split-gpg/ split-GPG] for email to reduce the risk of key theft used for encryption / decryption and signing.
* Create an AppVM that is exclusively used for email and  change the VM's firewall settings to only allow network connections to the email server and nothing else ("Deny network access except...").
* Only open [https://micahflee.com/2016/07/how-qubes-makes-handling-pdfs-way-safer/ untrusted email attachments] in a DisposableVM to prevent possible infection.

== Flash the Router with Opensource Firmware ==

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text       = '''Warning:''' risk of bricking your router!
}}

* Flash the insecure, limited-utility, proprietary firmware on the router with a [[Router_and_Local_Area_Network_Security#Router_Firmware|powerful, open-source GNU/Linux alternative]].

== Multi-Factor User Authentication ==

{{mbox
| type      = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text       = {{q_project_name}} only.
}}

* Utilize a [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/yubi-key/ Yubikey] to enhance the security of Qubes user authentication, mitigate the risk of password snooping, and to improve USB keyboard security.

== Whitelisting Tor Traffic ==

* [[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]]: Configure sys-whonix to use [[Corridor|corridor]] as a filtering gateway to ensure only connections to Tor relays pass through. <ref>This provides an additional fail-safe to protect from accidental clearnet leaks that might arise from hypothetical Whonix bugs, but does not address potential Qubes ProxyVM leaks.</ref> <ref>https://github.com/rustybird/corridor</ref>
* [[{{non q project name short}}|{{non q project name}}]] or Qubes-Whonix: Use a standalone [https://github.com/rustybird/corridor corridor] as a filtering gateway.

= Expert =

== Disable Intel ME Blobs ==

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text       = '''Warning:''' high risk of bricking your computer!
}}

* It is possible to [http://hardenedlinux.org/firmware/2016/11/17/neutralize_ME_firmware_on_sandybridge_and_ivybridge.html partially deblob] Intel's despicable ME firmware image by [https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner/blob/master/me_cleaner.py removing unnecessary partitions] from it.

== Install Libreboot ==

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text    = '''Warning:''' incompatible with newer architectures - risk of bricking your computer!
}}

* [https://libreboot.org/ Libreboot] is a free, opensource BIOS or UEFI replacement (firmware) that initializes the hardware and starts the bootloader for your OS. <ref>The open Qubes ticket on [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/1594 Research support for libreboot/coreboot-based systems] makes this recommendation unsuitable for {{q_project_name}} in early-2019.</ref>
