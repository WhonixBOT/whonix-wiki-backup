== Introduction ==
The virtualization platform is an essential component of a secure {{project_name}} system. A vulnerable virtualizer may provide opportunities for attackers to perform a breakout from a virtual machine in order to undo the security by isolation features that {{project_name}} provides. The decision to install an alternative virtualizer should not be taken lightly.

There are two methods that can be used to install VirtualBox and these are recommended over downloading, verifying, and installing binaries manually. The two repositories below are maintained by different teams, {{project name}}, Debian and VirtualBox.org, respectively.

= Recommended Version =
Recommended VirtualBox version: '''{{VirtualBox_Version}}'''</u> <ref>
{{Project name}} <code>{{VersionNew}}</code> was built and tested with VirtualBox version {{VirtualBox_Version}}. Newer VirtualBox are untested by {{Project name}} developers and can cause issues such as instability (VirtualBox suddenly closing, host freezing, black screen).
<br/><br/>
Newer VirtualBox versions are hard to install on Debian <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}</code>. Perhaps the VirtualBox host software is available (even as a Debian package) but VirtualBox guest additions are not available as a Debian package. Using an older version of VirtualBox guest additions (such as the pre-installed ones) might lead to broken functionality such as inability to resize the VM or instability. [https://forums.whonix.org/t/virtualbox-guest-additions/8998/3 Installation of VirtualBox guest additions from ISO might also cause issues.]
<br/><br/>

Therefore we are stuck with VirtualBox version {{VirtualBox_Version}}.

Instructions for installing {{project_name}} on VirtualBox such as flavor [[VirtualBox/XFCE|{{project_name}} for VirtualBox with XFCE]] contain a quote:

<blockquote>
* <u>Linux</u> [[File:Tux.png|15px|link=]]: please press expand on the right side.
</blockquote>

Once expanded, instructions there will be the recommended instructions on how to install VirtualBox.

= Newer Version =
== Install VirtualBox from Debian Unstable ==
This is no longer recommended at this time. <ref>
Dependencies such as for package <code>glibc</code> are to new. Too many updated dependencies from Debian unstable are pulled and mixed with Debian stable. This can cause many issues such as system instability.
</ref>

== Install from Oracle Repository ==
[[Free Support Principle]] applies.

[https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads Latest Oracle VirtualBox package information]

Warning: This is a [[Install_Software#Foreign_Sources|foreign source]].

Note: if you upgrade the VirtualBox host version this can cause issues with the guest VMs such as broken VM size adjustment (full screen) <ref>
http://forums.whonix.org/t/problems-after-upgrading-whonix/9647/16
</ref> unless you also upgrade the VirtualBox guest additions inside your virtual machine which is not covered in these instructions.

Add oracle apt sources list.

(Change <code>{{Stable_project_version_based_on_Debian_codename}}</code> to the current name of your stable distribution.)

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo su -c "echo -e 'deb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian {{Stable_project_version_based_on_Debian_codename}} contrib' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/oracle.list"
}}

Add Oracle's signing key to apt-get keyring.

{{apt key add
|url=https://www.virtualbox.org/download/oracle_vbox_2016.asc
|source_filename=oracle_vbox_2016.asc
|target_filename=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/oracle.gpg
|gpg_fingerprint_output=
pub   rsa4096/A2F683C52980AECF 2016-04-22 [SC]<br />
      Key fingerprint = B9F8 D658 297A F3EF C18D  5CDF A2F6 83C5 2980 AECF<br />

sub   rsa4096/AD18C79D920E471F 2016-04-22 [E]<br />
}}

{{Update}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}

Install VirtualBox and Linux Kernel Headers, which are a dependency.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install virtualbox-6.1 linux-headers-$(uname -r)
}}

[[VirtualBox/Guest Additions|VirtualBox Guest Additions]] ISO is included in the package. Mount ISO in guest virtual machine to install. [https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#idp46640732075968 Instructions]
