= Introduction =

The virtualization platform is an essential component of a secure {{project_name}} system. A vulnerable virtualizer may provide opportunities for attackers to perform a breakout from a virtual machine in order to undo the security by isolation features that {{project_name}} provides. The decision to install an alternative virtualizer should not be taken lightly.

The two methods described below to install VirtualBox are recommended because they are safer than downloading, verifying, and installing binaries manually. The two repositories below are maintained by different teams: {{project name}}, Debian and VirtualBox.org, respectively.

= Recommended VirtualBox Version =

Recommended VirtualBox version. <ref>
{{Project name}} <code>{{VersionNew}}</code> was built and tested with VirtualBox version {{VirtualBox_Version}}. Newer VirtualBox are untested by {{Project name}} developers and can cause issues such as instability (VirtualBox suddenly closing, host freezing, black screen).
<br/><br/>
Newer VirtualBox versions are hard to install on Debian <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}</code>. Perhaps the VirtualBox host software is available (even as a Debian package) but VirtualBox guest additions are not available as a Debian package. Using an older version of VirtualBox guest additions (such as the pre-installed ones) might lead to broken functionality such as an inability to resize the VM or instability. [https://forums.whonix.org/t/virtualbox-guest-additions/8998/3 Installation of VirtualBox guest additions from ISO might also cause issues.]
<br/><br/>

Therefore {{project_name}} is stuck with VirtualBox version {{VirtualBox_Version}}.

Instructions for installing {{project_name}} on VirtualBox such as flavor [[VirtualBox/XFCE|{{project_name}} for VirtualBox with XFCE]] contain a quote:

<blockquote>
* <u>Linux</u> [[File:Tux.png|15px|link=]]: please press expand on the right side.
</blockquote>

Once expanded, the recommended instructions will explain how to install VirtualBox.

= Newer VirtualBox Version =
== Install VirtualBox from Debian Unstable ==
This is discouraged at the moment. <ref>
Dependencies such as for package <code>glibc</code> are too new. This means a host of updated dependencies from Debian unstable are pulled and mixed with Debian stable, often leading to many issues including system instability.
</ref>

{{Anchor|Install from Oracle Repository}}

== Install from VirtualBox.org Repository ==

{{mbox

| text    = '''Warning:''' this procedure will install a [[Install_Software#Foreign_Sources|foreign software source]].
}}

The [[Free Support Principle]] applies to this procedure. The latest Oracle VirtualBox package information can be found [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads here].

<u>Note</u>: after upgrading the VirtualBox host version, this can cause issues with the guest VMs such as broken VM size adjustment (full screen) <ref>
[https://forums.whonix.org/t/problems-after-upgrading-whonix/9647/16 Problems after upgrading Whonix - cannot full size Whonix-Workstation screen]
</ref> unless the VirtualBox guest additions are also upgraded inside your virtual machine (which is not covered in these instructions).

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Add the Oracle apt sources list.

Make sure to change <code>{{Stable_project_version_based_on_Debian_codename}}</code> to the current name of your stable distribution.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo su -c "echo -e 'deb https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian {{Stable_project_version_based_on_Debian_codename}} contrib' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/oracle.list"
}}

'''2.''' Add Oracle's signing key to apt-get keyring.

{{apt key add
|url=https://www.virtualbox.org/download/oracle_vbox_2016.asc
|source_filename=oracle_vbox_2016.asc
|target_filename=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/oracle.gpg

}}

'''3.''' {{Update}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}

'''4.''' Install VirtualBox and Linux Kernel Headers, which are a dependency.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install virtualbox-6.1 linux-headers-$(uname -r)
}}

'''5.''' Mount the ISO in the guest virtual machine to install.

The [[VirtualBox/Guest Additions|VirtualBox Guest Additions]] ISO is included in the package. Instructions can be found [https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#idp46640732075968 here].
