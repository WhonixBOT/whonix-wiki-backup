= Introduction =

The virtualization platform is an essential component of a secure {{project_name}} system. A vulnerable virtualizer may provide opportunities for attackers to perform a breakout from a virtual machine in order to undo the security by isolation features that {{project_name}} provides. The decision to install an alternative virtualizer should not be taken lightly.

The two methods described below to install VirtualBox are safer than downloading, verifying, and installing binaries manually.

= Recommended VirtualBox Version =

= Newer VirtualBox Version =
== Install VirtualBox from Debian Unstable ==
This is discouraged at the moment. <ref>
Dependencies such as for package <code>glibc</code> are too new. This means a host of updated dependencies from Debian unstable are pulled and mixed with Debian stable, often leading to many issues including system instability.

}}

The [[Free Support Principle]] applies to this procedure. The latest Oracle VirtualBox package information can be found [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads here].

<u>Note</u>: after upgrading the VirtualBox host version, this can cause issues with the guest VMs such as broken VM size adjustment (full screen) <ref>
[https://forums.whonix.org/t/problems-after-upgrading-whonix/9647/16 Problems after upgrading Whonix - cannot full size Whonix-Workstation screen]
</ref> unless the VirtualBox guest additions are also upgraded inside your virtual machine (which is not covered in these instructions).

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Add the Oracle apt sources list.

Make sure to change <code>{{Stable_project_version_based_on_Debian_codename}}</code> to the current name of your stable distribution.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo su -c "echo -e 'deb https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian {{Stable_project_version_based_on_Debian_codename}} contrib' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/oracle.list"
}}

'''2.''' Add Oracle's signing key to apt-get keyring.

{{apt key add
|url=https://www.virtualbox.org/download/oracle_vbox_2016.asc
|source_filename=oracle_vbox_2016.asc
|target_filename=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/oracle.gpg
|gpg_fingerprint_output=

}}

'''3.''' {{Update}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}

'''4.''' Install VirtualBox and Linux Kernel Headers, which are a dependency.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install virtualbox-6.1 linux-headers-$(uname -r)
}}

'''5.''' Mount the ISO in the guest virtual machine to install.

The [[VirtualBox/Guest Additions|VirtualBox Guest Additions]] ISO is included in the package. Instructions can be found [https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#idp46640732075968 here].
