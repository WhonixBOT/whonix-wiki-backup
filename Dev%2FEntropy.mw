= Introduction =

Whonix 0.5.5 and above have haveged installed by default. (see below)

The [http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man4/random.4.html Linux Kernel man page] says: "''[...] /dev/random should be suitable for uses that need very high quality randomness'' [...]".

Quoted from the [https://we.riseup.net/riseup+tech/entropy riseup.net page about entropy]: "''[...] entropy-estimation is a black-art and not very well understood [...]''".

While it would be good to be cautions, i.e. learning about the entropy quality in Virtual Machines and if required learning about methods to improve it, it's not a critical problem. Successful entropy estimation attacks have never been reported for any software.

== Software Packages ==

It has to be researched if they do work well inside Virtual Machines (VirtualBox). Simply installing all of them may not be wise.

=== haveged ===

Haveged is an entropy gathering daemon.

Quoted from the [http://www.issihosts.com/haveged/ais31.html haveged testing page]: "''[...] will behave similarly in a virtual environment is a more risky proposition [...] there have been reports of VM that implement the processor time stamp counter as a constant and there are known differences in cpuid operation in others. [...]''"

Will haveged create sufficient entropy in VirtualBox? Luckily, haveged comes with tools to check the if the entropy it creates.

The README in the haveged source folder and the [http://www.issihosts.com/haveged/index.html haveged website] contains [http://www.issihosts.com/haveged/ais31.html instructions] for testing haveged.

Makes sense to test entropy while haveged is disabled.
<pre>
sudo service haveged stop
</pre>

Get haveged sources and test.

<pre>
apt-get source haveged
cd haveged-*
./configure --enable-nistest
make check

## perhaps repeat
#make clean
#make check
</pre>

Should say something like

<pre>
0 failed individual tests
PASS: nist/test.sh
==================
All 2 tests passed
==================
</pre>

* This was successfully tested in VirtualBox without haveged running.
* This was successfully tested in VirtualBox with haveged running.
* This was successfully tested in kvm without rng device and without haveged running.
* This was successfully tested in kvm without rng device and with haveged running.

= Hardware Entropy Keys =

==Entropy Key==
[http://www.entropykey.co.uk/ Entropy Key]; Hardware not fully open source. Some resources say, it's okay as an additional source of entropy. Where to add it? Since Whonix depends on a host operating system, the Whonix-Gateway and the Whonix-Workstation, where it does make most sense to add it? Perhaps adding it to the host and using a entropy broker could be the most effective method. Better than buying three entropy keys.

==OneRNG==
[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/moonbaseotago/onerng-an-open-source-entropy-generator OneRNG]; Hardware and Firmware fully open source. Firmware is cryptographically signed to ensure it hasn't been tampered with. Board has a removable tin RF Shield so you can verify the circuits match the diagrams provided by the manufacturer. Fully reprogrammable with manufacturer provided software+cable (must be bought separately). Where to add it? Since Whonix depends on a host operating system, the Whonix-Gateway and the Whonix-Workstation, where it does make most sense to add it? Perhaps adding it to the host and using a entropy broker could be the most effective method.
