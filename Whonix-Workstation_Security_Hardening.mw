{{security intro}}

This page is targeted at users who wish to improve the security of their {{Workstation product name}} to become even more secure.

= Introduction =

{{project_name}} is by no means a perfectly hardened system. Additional hardening measures are most welcome, but at the same time hardening by default is very difficult. Until the {{project_name}} project realizes a significant increase in resources or community assistance, extra measures will remain out of scope and hardening will be left to the upstream operating system. See [[Dev/Virtualization_Platform|Virtualization Platform]] for further details.

= AppArmor =

Learn more about [http://wiki.apparmor.net AppArmor], which helps to protect against vulnerabilities by confining a program's file access based upon strict rule-sets. It is recommended to apply the available [[AppArmor#Installation|{{project_name}} AppArmor profiles]] to contain various applications which are run in {{gateway_product_name}} (<code>sys-whonix</code>) and/or {{workstation_product_name}} (<code>anon-whonix</code>), like Tor, Tor Browser, Thunderbird and others.

= Disable TCP SACK =

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_SACK#Selective_acknowledgments TCP Selective Acknowledgement (SACK)] is a commonly exploited option in the TCP protocol and not needed for many people. <ref>For example, it has been used for [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SACK_Panic#SACK_Panic remote denial of service attacks] and can even lead to a Linux kernel panic.</ref>  For this reason, it is recommended to disable it unless required.

{{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/sysctl.d/30_security-misc.conf
}}

Uncomment all lines starting with <code>net.ipv4</code>.

This procedure can also be repeated on the {{Gateway product name}}.

TCP SACK is not disabled by default because on some systems it can greatly decrease network performance. <ref>

= Multiple Tor Browser Instances and Workstations =

{{mbox

| text    = As noted on the [[Warning]] page, [[Warning#{{project_name}}_does_not_Separate_Different_Contextual_Identities|{{project_name}} does not Separate Different Contextual Identities]]. 
}}

Appropriate compartmentalization of user activities is important when different identities and/or additional software are in use. Multiple Tor Browser instances provide some separation of distinct identities, however this issue has not yet been fully solved by [[Tor_Browser|Tor Browser]] or [[Tor_Browser#Torbutton|Torbutton]]. A more secure method of compartmentalization is using [[Multiple {{workstation_product_name_short}}|Multiple {{workstation_product_name}}]], which are easily created.

== Multiple Tor Browser Instances ==

To better separate different contextual identities, consider starting multiple Tor Browser instances. Follow the steps in the [[Manually Downloading Tor Browser]] entry, except for minor changes that are necessary; for example Tor Browser must be extracted into a different folder.

This method is less secure than using multiple {{workstation_product_name}}, which is outlined below.

== Multiple {{workstation_product_name}} ==

For tasks requiring different identities and/or additional software, it is recommended to utilize [[Multiple_{{workstation_product_name_short}}|two or more {{workstation_product_name}} VMs]] since different torified clients are isolated from each other. In this configuration, a Tor Browser exploit in one {{workstation_product_name}} cannot simultaneously read the user's identity in another VM (for example, an IRC account). <ref>This does not protect against the sudden loss of networking, which could reveal to the attacker that two activities / accounts suddenly going off-line are probably related.</ref> 

This method is less secure than using Tor Browser in a Qubes [[Qubes/Disposable_VM|{{workstation_product_name}} DisposableVM]].
