{{security intro}}

This page is targeted at users who wish to improve the security of their {{Workstation product name}} to become even more secure.

= Introduction =

{{project_name}} is by no means a perfectly hardened system. Additional hardening measures are most welcome, but at the same time hardening by default is very difficult. Until the {{project_name}} project realizes a significant increase in resources or community assistance, extra measures will remain out of scope and hardening will be left to the upstream operating system. See [[Dev/Virtualization_Platform|Virtualization Platform]] for further details.

= AppArmor =

Learn more about [http://wiki.apparmor.net AppArmor], which helps to protect against vulnerabilities by confining a program's file access based upon strict rule-sets. It is recommended to apply the available [[AppArmor#Installation|{{project_name}} AppArmor profiles]] to contain various applications which are run in {{gateway_product_name}} (<code>sys-whonix</code>) and/or {{workstation_product_name}} (<code>anon-whonix</code>), like Tor, Tor Browser, Thunderbird and others.

= Disable TCP SACK =

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_SACK#Selective_acknowledgments TCP Selective Acknowledgement (SACK)] is a commonly exploited option in the TCP protocol and not needed for many people. <ref>For example, it has been used for [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SACK_Panic#SACK_Panic remote denial of service attacks] and can even lead to a Linux kernel panic.</ref>  For this reason, it is recommended to disable it unless required.

{{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/sysctl.d/30_security-misc.conf
}}

Uncomment all lines starting with <code>net.ipv4</code>.

This procedure can also be repeated on the {{Gateway product name}}.

TCP SACK is not disabled by default because on some systems it can greatly decrease network performance. <ref>

= Multiple Tor Browser Instances and Workstations =

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text    = As noted on the [[Warning]] page, [[Warning#{{project_name}}_does_not_Separate_Different_Contextual_Identities|{{project_name}} does not Separate Different Contextual Identities]]. 
}}

Appropriate compartmentalization of user activities is important when different identities and/or additional software are in use. Multiple Tor Browser instances provide some separation of distinct identities, however this issue has not yet been fully solved by [[Tor_Browser|Tor Browser]] or [[Tor_Browser#Torbutton|Torbutton]]. A more secure method of compartmentalization is using [[Multiple {{workstation_product_name_short}}|Multiple {{workstation_product_name}}]], which are easily created.

== Multiple Tor Browser Instances ==

To better separate different contextual identities, consider starting multiple Tor Browser instances. Follow the steps in the [[Manually Downloading Tor Browser]] entry, except for minor changes that are necessary; for example Tor Browser must be extracted into a different folder.

This method is less secure than using multiple {{workstation_product_name}}, which is outlined below.

== Multiple {{workstation_product_name}} ==

For tasks requiring different identities and/or additional software, it is recommended to utilize [[Multiple_{{workstation_product_name_short}}|two or more {{workstation_product_name}} VMs]] since different torified clients are isolated from each other. In this configuration, a Tor Browser exploit in one {{workstation_product_name}} cannot simultaneously read the user's identity in another VM (for example, an IRC account). <ref>This does not protect against the sudden loss of networking, which could reveal to the attacker that two activities / accounts suddenly going off-line are probably related.</ref> 

This method is less secure than using Tor Browser in a Qubes [[Qubes/Disposable_VM|{{workstation_product_name}} DisposableVM]].

= Restrict Hardware Information to Root =

Details about your hardware can be used for identification, so Whonix includes the <code>hide-hardware-info.service</code> systemd unit that restricts access to <code>/proc/cpuinfo</code>, <code>/proc/bus</code>, <code>/proc/scsi</code> and <code>/sys</code> to the root user only. This hides most hardware identifiers and increases security as <code>/sys</code> exposes a lot of information that should not be accessible by unprivileged users.

This setting is disabled by default because it might break many applications. It can optionally be enabled by running the following command.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl enable hide-hardware-info.service
}}

This command can also be run on {{Gateway product name}}.

A whitelist that allows specific applications to access <code>/sys</code> and <code>/proc/cpuinfo</code> is enabled by default to maintain basic functionality. For example, this allows the launching of applications like XFCE.

== Whitelisting Applications ==

To whitelist applications, they must be run under the <code>sysfs</code> group (if allowing access to <code>/sys</code>) or the <code>cpuinfo</code> group (if allowing access to <code>/proc/cpuinfo</code>).

For example, to run a systemd service as the <code>sysfs</code> group, create a [[Configuration_Files#Configuration_Drop-In_Folders|drop-in directory]] and add the following.

{{CodeSelect|code=
[Service]
SupplementaryGroups=sysfs
}}

To run a specific binary as the <code>sysfs</code> group, the binary must be owned by the <code>sysfs</code> group and be made setgid. To achieve this, change the ownership of the binary by running the following.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo chgrp sysfs /path/to/binary
}}

Then make the binary setgid.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo chmod g+s /path/to/binary
}}

The binary will now run with the permissions of the <code>sysfs</code> group and have access to <code>/sys</code>.

All of these steps can also be applied to the <code>cpuinfo</code> group.

Remember that any whitelisted applications add to the attack surface. An attacker can attempt to exploit a vulnerability in the whitelisted application(s) to gain access to hardware information.

== Disable the Whitelist ==

In order to reduce the attack surface as much as possible, optionally the whitelist can be disabled entirely.

{{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/hide-hardware-info.d/30_whitelist.conf
}}

Uncomment the <code>sysfs_whitelist=0</code> and <code>cpuinfo_whitelist=0</code> sections to disable the whitelist.

Note that this setting will break many applications; for example, the desktop environment will not even start. Do not perform this action unless you understand the implications and can reverse the change.
