= Introduction =

Whonix is by no means a perfectly hardened system. Additional hardening measures are most welcome, but at the same time hardening by default is very difficult. Until the Whonix project realizes a significant increase in resources or community assistance, extra measures will remain out of scope and hardening will be left to the upstream operating system. See [[Dev/Virtualization_Platform|Virtualization Platform]] for further details.

= AppArmor =

Learn more about [http://wiki.apparmor.net AppArmor], which helps to protect against vulnerabilities by confining a program's file access based upon strict rule-sets. It is recommended to apply the available [[AppArmor#Installation|Whonix AppArmor profiles]] to contain various applications which are run in Whonix-Gateway (<code>sys-whonix</code>) and/or Whonix-Workstation (<code>anon-whonix</code>), like Tor, Tor Browser, Thunderbird and others.

Appropriate compartmentalization of user activities is important when different identities and/or additional software are in use. Multiple Tor Browser instances provide some separation of distinct identities, however this issue has not yet been fully solved by [[Tor_Browser|Tor Browser]] or [[Tor_Browser#Torbutton|Torbutton]]. A more secure method of compartmentalization is using [[Multiple Whonix-Workstations]], which are easily created.

== Multiple Tor Browser Instances ==

To better separate different contextual identities, consider starting multiple Tor Browser instances. Follow the steps in the [[Manually Downloading Tor Browser]] entry, except for minor changes that are necessary; for example Tor Browser must be extracted into a different folder.

This method is less secure than using multiple Whonix-Workstations, which is outlined below.

== Multiple Whonix-Workstations ==

For tasks requiring different identities and/or additional software, it is recommended to utilize [[Multiple_Whonix-Workstations|two or more Whonix-Workstation VMs]] since different torified clients are isolated from each other. In this configuration, a Tor Browser exploit in one Whonix-Workstation cannot simultaneously read the user's identity in another VM (for example, an IRC account). <ref>This does not protect against the sudden loss of networking, which could reveal to the attacker that two activities / accounts suddenly going off-line are probably related.</ref> 

This method is less secure than using Tor Browser in a Qubes [[Qubes/Disposable_VM|Whonix-Workstation DisposableVM]].
