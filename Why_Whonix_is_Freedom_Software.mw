! scope="row"| Legal 
| Whonix is based on [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html Freedom Software]. A lot of Libre licensed software prohibits modification and distribution without sharing the modified source code.
|-
! scope="row"| Ethics 
| Whonix developers believe it is immoral to benefit from those [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software Free]/Freedom Software components and give back nothing. We stand on the shoulders of giants - Whonix and many other Libre software projects are only made possible because people invested in writing code that is kept accessible for the public benefit.
|-
! scope="row"| Community 
| It is rewarding and enjoyable to have all types of people [[Contribute|contributing]]. This works best in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source Open Source] projects.
|-
! scope="row"| Impact 
| When free in price, Whonix can spread faster than commercial tools that cannot provide anonymity or privacy by design.
|-
! scope="row"| Commerce 
| Developers hope to make a living from Whonix by selling additional services. ([[Priority Support]] | [[Professional Support]])
|-
! scope="row"| Career
