= No Intentional User Freedom Restrictions =
In the spirit of Freedom Software, {{project name}} does not intentionally restrict user freedoms. {{project name}} might discourage certain configurations in its documentation but ultimately the user is free to ignore such advice. Programs developed under the {{project name}} might prevent users from harming themselves by doing discouraged things (such as for example [[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#Running_Tor_Browser_in_Qubes_TemplateVM_or_DVM_Template|starting Tor Browser in Qubes DVM Template]]) but documentation will contain instructions how to disable such security mechanisms. In either case the user has ultimate control over the configuration of {{project name}}.
