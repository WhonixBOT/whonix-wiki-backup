|-
! scope="row"| Ethics 
| {{project_name}} developers believe it is immoral to benefit from those [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software Free]/Freedom Software components and give back nothing. We stand on the shoulders of giants - {{project_name}} and many other Libre software projects are only made possible because people invested in writing code that is kept accessible for the public benefit.

= No Intentional User Freedom Restrictions =
In the spirit of Freedom Software, {{project name}} does not intentionally restrict user freedoms. {{project name}} documentation might discourage certain configurations, but ultimately the user is free to ignore such advice. 

In their default state, programs developed under the {{project name}} banner may afford additional protection against unsafe user configurations. For example, users are unable to [[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#Running_Tor_Browser_in_Qubes_TemplateVM_or_DisposableVM_Template|start Tor Browser in Qubes' DisposableVM Template]] since this is a known anonymity risk and recommended against, but documentation is still provided on how to disable this security mechanism.

[[About#Based_on_Debian|{{project name}} is based on Debian]]. A valid viewpoint is, that {{project name}} is a very specific configuration of Debian. As such, the technical implementation of {{project name}} can be independently replicate by any advanced user of Debian. Therefore anything {{project name}} pre-configured can be re-configured or de-configured by the user without restrictions. There are no technologies used inside {{project_name}} attempting to prevent user customization. No configuration of {{project_name}} is intentionally obfuscated.

Simply put, the end user maintains ultimate control over the final {{project_name}} configuration best suited to their needs.
