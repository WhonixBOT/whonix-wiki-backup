|-
! scope="row"| Legal 
| {{project_name}} is based on [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html Freedom Software]. A lot of Libre licensed software prohibits modification and distribution without sharing the modified source code.
|-
! scope="row"| Ethics 
| {{project_name}} developers believe it is immoral to benefit from those [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software Free]/Freedom Software components and give back nothing. We stand on the shoulders of giants - {{project_name}} and many other Libre software projects are only made possible because people invested in writing code that is kept accessible for the public benefit.
|-
! scope="row"| Community 
| It is rewarding and enjoyable to have all types of people [[Contribute|contributing]]. This works best in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source Open Source] projects.
|-
! scope="row"| Impact 
| When free in price, {{project_name}} can spread faster than commercial tools that cannot provide anonymity or privacy by design.
|-
! scope="row"| Commerce 
| Developers hope to make a living from {{project_name}} by selling additional services. ([[Priority Support]] | [[Professional Support]])

! scope="row"| Career
| Our experience volunteering on this project improves our skill set and makes us more valuable employees.

= No Intentional User Freedom Restrictions =
In the spirit of Freedom Software, {{project name}} does not intentionally restrict user freedoms. {{project name}} documentation might discourage certain configurations, but ultimately the user is free to ignore such advice. 

In their default state, programs developed under the {{project name}} banner may afford additional protection against unsafe user configurations. For example, users are unable to [[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#Running_Tor_Browser_in_Qubes_TemplateVM_or_DisposableVM_Template|start Tor Browser in Qubes' DisposableVM Template]] since this is a known anonymity risk and recommended against, but documentation is still provided on how to disable this security mechanism.

Since [[About#Based_on_Debian|{{project name}} is based on Debian]] it is valid to state that {{project name}} has adopted a specific Debian configuration. For this reason advanced Debian users can independently replicate the same technical implementation. Anything {{project name}} has pre-configured can be re-/de-configured by the user without restriction. User customization is not prevented by technologies used inside {{project_name}}, nor is configuration of {{project_name}} intentionally obfuscated.

Simply put, the end user maintains ultimate control over the final {{project_name}} configuration that best suits their needs.

= Software Fork Friendly =
For example, {{project name}} wiki markup text does not write <code>{{project name}}</code> literally. Instead it uses variables such as [[[[Template:project_name]]|<code>project_name</code>]] which contains variable content <code>{{project name}}</code>. By changing the contents of that wiki template to a different textual string such as <code>MyForkedProject</code>, the name of the project would change wiki wide from <code>{{project name}}</code> to <code>MyForkedProject</code>.
