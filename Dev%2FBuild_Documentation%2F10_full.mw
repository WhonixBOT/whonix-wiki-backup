= Build Documentation =
== Introduction ==
This page documents how to build Whonix VirtualBox {{Code2|.ova}} or {{Code2|.qcow2}} images (for [[KVM]]). If you have any questions or need help, get in Contact.

It documents how to build the '''stable''' of Whonix.

Knowledge assumed: basic principles of Virtualization; operation of your platform; Linux knowledge: how to install Debian and basic command line knowledge.

Only one prerequisite: you need a working internet connection.

For discussion related to the development and build process of Whonix images get
in contact.

How to use the resulting images, is documented in the [[Documentation]].

== Warning ==
* <u>'''Short'''</u>: '''Don't add private files to Whonix's source code folder! [...]'''
<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed" style="width:800px">
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
''Long'': [...] Unless you know what you are doing. Technically, it would work. Everything in whonix_gateway folder will get installed on Whonix-Gateway, whonix_workstation folder respectively, whonix_shared folder goes to both Whonix machines. This is recommended against. Those files would get managed by either the whonix-gateway-files, whonix-workstation-files or the whonix-shared-files package. When you later update Whonix debian packages, your files would get deleted by the package manager. Also adding private files to Whonix's source code folder, later contributing to Whonix's development and accidentally pushing the wrong git branch would be a disaster. Better add your private files to Whonix after building Whonix. Or add a custom build step adding your files, which then get copied from a folder outside of Whonix's source folder.

''Long'': Building Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation at the same time is not supported due to limitations in the build script.

''Long'': Because likely might change the build process from a non-interactive one to an interactive one. You're better off purging apt-listchanges.

<pre>
sudo apt-get purge apt-listchanges

Alternatively, you could use a non-interactive frontend for {{Code2|apt-listchanges}} such as {{Code2|text}}. To do so, you would have to edit {{Code2|/etc/apt/listchanges.conf}}.

<pre>
sudo nano /etc/apt/listchanges.conf

After Whonix has been build, you're free to reinstall {{Code2|apt-listchanges}}.

Usually you are not using [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration CI] environments without knowing.

You can find out if you are running inside a CI environment by running.

Everything is fine.

Otherwise, if it were to show.

Then don't use these images for anything besides testing.

== Build Anonymity ==
While downloading the required tools for building Whonix your internet service provider could if he want notice that you want to build Whonix. This is especially interesting, if you want to redistribute Whonix, but still want to stay anonymous. The full story can be read in the chapter [[Build Anonymity]].

== Build Security ==
Especially, but not exclusively, if you want to distribute Whonix images, you should improve the security of your build environment.

* Build on a dedicated build system, install security updates... ([[Security Guide]])
* All installation medium<ref>Such as DVD or USB.</ref> and all downloaded/used code must be verified (including all software on the host).
* Hashes, fingerprints in the scripts and the wiki is not to be trusted. Verify everything.
* Read [[Trust]].

== Host Preparation ==
<!--
EDITORS NOTE: The following host preparation text is duplicated on 3 pages.
(1) [[Physical Isolation]]
(2) [[Dev/Build Documentation]] for VM images
(3) Whonix debian packages.
When making changes here, please consider also making changes there.
(Not using a template, because it would probably require a version specific template.)
-->
* You need to build on '''Debian <u>oldstable</u> (currently: wheezy)'''. (How to obtain Debian safely: <ref>[[Debian|Debian ISO OpenPGP verification]]</ref>) <ref>The build scripts could be adapted to run on other {{Code2|*NIX}} systems as well but currently they assume {{Code2|apt-get}} and {{Code2|grml-debootstrap}} to be available.</ref>
* Build dependencies and configurations get automatically applied, so you don't have to worry about that. <ref>By {{Code2|[https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/build-steps.d/1100_prepare-build-machine build-steps.d/1100_prepare-build-machine]}}.))</ref>
* It is recommended to set your terminal (for example Konsole) to unlimited scrollback, so you can watch the full build log.
* You need ~ 30 GB free disk space. When you build inside a Virtual Machine using sparse files such as VirtualBox, consider assigning 100 GB free space. (Sparse files will grow as space is actually used. Won't take up space if it's not used. Easier to have the option to use more space than growing the image later.) More info: <ref>~ 25 GB might suffice as well. We haven't messured that in detail yet. Less space required, if you only want to build either Whonix-Gateway or Whonix-Workstation. Less space for Whonix-Gateway required than for Whonix-Workstation.</ref>

== Building Whonix in Whonix ==
<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed" style="width:800px">
'''You only have to read this, if you want to build Whonix in Whonix.''' <br />
If you are interested, click on Expand on the right.
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">

Building Whonix in Whonix is possible as well (if the Whonix version you are using as host is also based on Debian stable (currently: wheezy)). Unfortunately, apt-cacher-ng does not like Whonix's apt repository on sourceforge.net. Patrick already reported a bug. As long as this bug isn't fixed, you need to disable Whonix's apt repository while building Whonix. You can do this using the {{Code2|whonix_repository}} tool.

<pre>
sudo whonix_repository --disable
</pre>
</div>
</div>

== Introduction into Whonix Source Code ==
'''If you prefer to read and understand the source code just by reading scripts you may skip this optional chapter.'''

When you like to mess with the source code, it would probably help a lot if you at least know what {{Code|.img}}, {{Code|.vdi}}, {{Code|.vmdk}} and {{Code|.ova}} are being used for. See [[Dev/Source_Code_Intro|Source Code Introduction]].

== Preparation Steps ==
'''Only required if you want to redistribute (official) Whonix builds.'''

See [[Dev/Redistribution#Pre_Building|Redistribution Pre Building]].

{{Build_Documentation_Get_Source_Code}}

{{Build_Configuration}}

== VM Creation ==
<!--
EDITORS NOTE:
I am not sure it is a great idea to first tell builders how to build Whonix and later how to clean up to prepare for another build. Running the cleanup steps before the creation steps may be unnecessary when running these steps for the first time, but doesn't hurt either. An important thing this does archive is creating fewer support requests and bug reports from people running these steps for the second time without remembering they have to clean up first. If you want to discuss this, please open a new discussion in the development forums.
-->

Open a terminal (such as Konsole).

The {{Code2|whonix_build}} script can invoke the {{Code2|help-steps/whonix_build_one}} help step multiple times to build multiple virtual machines at once. The syntax is.

<pre>
whonix_build <parameters for whonix_build> -- <parameters for help-steps/whonix_build_one>
</pre>

Don't worry too much about the syntax, you'll see hands-on examples below.

The {{Code2|help-steps/whonix_build_one}} help step needs a parameter to know your build target. The following build targets are available.

<pre>
--target virtualbox
--target qcow2
--target raw
--target root
</pre>

In context of build documentation for the current page you are reading, if you are interested in,

* {{Code2|--target root}} you should look into our [[Dev/Build_Documentation/Physical_Isolation|Physical Isolation Build Documentation]] instead.
* {{Code2|.ova}} images (most likely for [[VirtualBox]] or [[VMware]], then choose {{Code2|--target virtualbox}}
* {{Code2|.qcow2}} images (most likely for [[KVM]] or [[QEMU]]), then choose {{Code2|--target qcow2}}
* {{Code2|.raw}} images (most likley for [[Qubes]]), then choose {{Code2|--target raw}}

{{Code2|--target virtualbox}} can be combined with {{Code2|--target qcow2}} as well as {{Code2|--target raw}}, which is useful for redistributable builds. Note, that {{Code2|--target virtualbox}} is currently the most tested option.

Delete eventually already existing Whonix-Gateway virtual machine. '''Warning''': This will delete a virtual machine named Whonix-Gateway from VirtualBox!

<pre>
sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build --flavor whonix-gateway -- --clean --target virtualbox
</pre>

Delete eventually already existing Whonix-Workstation virtual machine. '''Warning''': This will delete a virtual machine named Whonix-Workstation from VirtualBox!

<pre>
sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build --flavor whonix-workstation -- --clean --target virtualbox
</pre>

From now, you have two options. If you do not wish to use different build configurations for Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation (for example, if you do not wish to create a terminal-only Whonix-Gateway and a full Whonix-Workstation), to build both virtual machines at once, you could use.

<pre>
sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build --flavor whonix-gateway --flavor whonix-workstation -- --build --target virtualbox
</pre>

If you wish to use different build configurations, you must build one after the other as described below.

Build a Whonix-Gateway virtual machine image.

<pre>
sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build --flavor whonix-gateway -- --build --target virtualbox
</pre>

Eventually, if you wish to use a different build configuration for Whonix-Workstation, change the contents in your {{Code2|/etc/whonix_buildconfig.d}} folder.

Build a Whonix-Workstation virtual machine image.

<pre>
sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build --flavor whonix-workstation -- --build --target virtualbox
</pre>

The resulting {{Code2|.ova}}, {{Code2|.qcow2}} and/or {{Code2|.raw}} images can be found in {{Code|~/whonix_binary}} folder.

While building, you might see a few [[#Expected Build Warnings|Expected Build Warnings]].

Check if all went ok.

Please report back any issues!

= Expected Build Warnings =
<pre>
Can not write log, openpty() failed (/dev/pts not mounted?)
</pre>
Does not affect the build. <ref>Nothing to worry about. Only happens because we are running commands inside chroot. If you research this "issue", you'll read that it is purely cosmetic.</ref>

<pre>
[....] Your system does not have the CPU extensions required to use KVM. Not doing anything. ...[ FAIL ]
</pre>
Does not affect the build. <ref>KVM gets installed as dependency of our build dependency libguestfs-tools. We don't need KVM for building the actual images.</ref>

<pre>
[....] Stopping VirtualBox kernel modules [ ok ].
[....] Starting VirtualBox kernel modules[....] No suitable module for running kernel found ...[ FAIL ]
invoke-rc.d: initscript virtualbox, action "restart" failed.
</pre>
Does not affect the build. <ref>Only means, that VirtualBox can not be started. VirtualBox kernel modules could not be complied, because the {{Code|linux-headers-$(uname -r)}} package was not installed prior installing VirtualBox (prior starting Whonix's build script). The build script doesn't start VirtualBox, hence does not affect the build. The build script only uses {{Code|VBoxManage}} for creation of virtual machine description files and that tool doesn't need VirtualBox kernel modules.</ref>

<pre>
WARNING: The character device /dev/vboxdrv does not exist.
	 Please install the virtualbox-ose-dkms package and the appropriate
	 headers, most likely linux-headers-486.

	 You will not be able to start VMs until this problem is fixed.
</pre>
Does not affect the build. <ref>Same as above.</ref>

<pre>
dpkg: warning: failed to open configuration file '/root/.dpkg.cfg' for reading: Permission denied
</pre>
Does not affect the build. <ref>This happens because we are running {{Code|debuild}} as user, not root. Probably a bug in dpkg. If you research this, you'll see, there were many such bugs in dpkg.</ref>
