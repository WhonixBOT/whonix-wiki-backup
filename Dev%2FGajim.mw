|description=Gajim - TODO for installing Gajim by default in Whonix
}}

= TODO =

* Gajim might intelligently set a Tor socks user name per account already. Do we still manually specify a user/password?
** Gajim developers said they don't intelligently set a Tor socks user name per account. https://dev.gajim.org/gajim/gajim/issues/9213

* security
** (3) TODO: create an AppArmor profile
* does it have any [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO#Protocolleaks protocol leaks]?
** (4) TODO: check Gajim's built-in XML console
* how to pre-configure Gajim with all these settings by default as a linux distribution?
** (5) TODO: feature request for .d config folder support - https://dev.gajim.org/gajim/gajim/issues/9214

* feature request: Forcing OMEMO out of the box
** https://dev.gajim.org/gajim/gajim/issues/9215

= Resolved =

Was a blocker:

* Despite the proxy setting, it routes DNS requests use system default networking, thus end up in Tor's {{Code2|TransPort}}, thereby DNS is not [[Stream Isolation|stream isolated]].
** Won't be fixed. Python limitation.
** https://dev.gajim.org/gajim/gajim/issues/8538
** Violates [[Dev/Default_Application_Policy|{{project_name}} Default Application Policy]].
*** https://forums.whonix.org/t/gajim-messenger/708/7
*** https://forums.whonix.org/t/should-strict-stream-isolation-by-a-requirement-in-whonixs-default-appliation-policy
* --> Strict stream isolation removed from {{project name}} Default Application Policy.

= Done =

* Are uploads by gajim-httpupload encrypted using gajim-omemo?
** Developer responded: "yes if you have activated OMEMO, httpupload will always encrypt the file, in fact you can not send a unencrypted file with OMEMO activated even if you wanted."

* Plugin installer is only using https for verification which is weaker than gpg which is used by apt-get which is usually used to install software. <ref>

** We can nuke the plugin installer. [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/anon-apps-config anon-apps-config] which is installed by default will [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/anon-apps-config/blob/master/debian/anon-apps-config.hide deactivate gajim plugin installer / updater] because it's not secure. Using <code>config-package-dev</code> <code>displace</code>.
** (2) Debian feature request to ship the gajim plugin-installer plugin in a separate Debian package.<ref>https://bugs.debian.org/902237</ref>
