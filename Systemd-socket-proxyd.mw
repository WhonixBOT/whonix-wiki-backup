Socket proxying could be useful for any future applications that expect Tor or the ControlPort to listen on any specific port or unix domain socket file that is not (yet) added to <code>anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor</code> config by default, or for any other port or unix domain socket file redirections from the workstation to the Gateway.
