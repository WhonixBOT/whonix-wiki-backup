== Technical Introduction ==
When setting up {{project name}} in the form of two Virtual Machines running on the same physical host, exploits targeting the VM implementation or the host can still break out of the torified Client VM and expose the IP of a user. Malware running on the host has full control over all VMs. To protect such attacks we need a different approach: In this context we called it Physical Isolation, because the gateway system is installed on separate hardware. This drastically reduces the TCB<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_computing_base</ref> by more than the half.

In total we'll be installing and configuring two computers and set up an isolated point to point network between them (you could also set up a an ordinary, completely isolated, LAN behind the {{gateway_product_name}}). One computer acts as the client or "{{workstation_product_name}}", the other as a proxy or "{{gateway_product_name}}" which will transparently route all of the {{workstation_product_name}} traffic through Tor.

The {{gateway_product_name}} on its own physical device can either run directly on hardware or inside a virtual machine. Both options have advantages and disadvantages. We recommend to use no additional Virtual Machine for the {{gateway_product_name}}.

The {{workstation_product_name}} should always be installed in a Virtual Machine: A VM hides hardware serial numbers. See also [[Security_Guide#Recommendation_to_use_multiple_VM_Snapshots|Recommendation to use multiple VM Snapshots]].

The host operating system(s) should only be used for downloading operating system updating, hosting {{gateway_product_name}} or {{workstation_product_name}} and nothing else.

Bonus points if the physical systems are exclusively used for hosting {{project_name}}, or if storage devices are separated for {{project name}} and non-{{project_name}} use cases, to avoid a {{project name}} hard drive getting infected by a another operating system.

'''WARNING''': Less tested than VM builds. Needs your help for more rigid testing!

'''WARNING''': Instructions are difficult. Only advanced Linux users can understand them.

'''WARNING''': [[Dev/Build Anonymity]] has not been considered for this article.

'''WARNING''': Do also read the [[Dev/BuildDocumentation_8#Warning|warnings]] in the [[Dev/BuildDocumentation|latest build instructions for VM images]]. Some of them, {{Code2|Don't add private files to {{project name}} source code folder!}} and {{Code2|Check if the OpenPGP public keys are still up to date.}} also applies to the physical isolation page.

'''WARNING''': This article currently lacks information about {{gateway_product_name}} and {{workstation_product_name}} MAC address. See also:

'''WARNING''': {{software compartmentalization vs. physical separation}} (See also: [[Qubes|{{q_project_name}}]].)

== Using spare hardware + Virtual Machine ==

Advantages:

* You can install a graphical host.
* Use the {{project name}} download version.
* You can use the graphical network manager on the host, for example to connect to WiFi.
* You can setup easily a VPN on the host. Tor will be tunneled through the VPN.

Disadvantages:

* Higher attack surface, because the Virtual Machine code get's involved.

== Using spare hardware without Virtual Machine ==

Advantages:

* More secure, because less code is involved.

Disadvantages:

* Slightly more complicated setup
* More difficult to set up VPN
* More difficult to set up 3G networking compared to using a Windows host

== Hardware ==

=== General ===

We recommend that you use two dedicated computers for {{project name}} that are never used for activities that could lead back to your identity. Alternatively you can use an already existing and otherwise used computer for the {{gateway_product_name}}. To offer some isolation you should disconnect all internal and external drives and boot from a eSATA, USB or another internal drive into a clean environment.

=== non-anonymous use ===

* non-anonymous box (leave it as it is, like you want)
* non-anonymous home dial up internet router (leave it as it is, like you want)

=== anonymous use ===

A cheap plug computer, something like Raspberry Pi or the hardware used by Torouter would be sufficient.</ref>

If you do anyway, read warning, especially for Windows: [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransparentProxyLeaks Transparent Proxy Leaks].</ref>

= How To Install {{gateway_product_name}} on the Raspberry Pi 3 B (RPI3) =
* Contributor of <code>How To Install {{gateway_product_name}} on the Raspberry Pi 3 B (RPI3)</code>: [https://forums.whonix.org/u/Algernon Algernon]
* Forum discussion: [https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-for-arm64-raspberry-pi-rpi/1788 {{project name}} for arm64 / Raspberry Pi ( RPi )]

Get the source (see below).

From inside the {{project name}} source folder run:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo ./whonix_build --target raw --flavor whonix-gateway-rpi --build --arch arm64 --kernel linux-image-arm64 --headers linux-headers-arm64
}}

After a succesful build burn the <code>whonix_gw_rpi.img</code> to a micro SD card using gnome-disk-utility.
# Within gnome-disk-utility select the SD card. 
# At the top panel select options (next to the poweroff button). 
# Click restore disk image and choose the respective file. 
# Click start restoring and wait until it is finished. 
# Put the SD card into the RPI3, attach an HDMI monitor, an USB-ethernet adapter as well as a keyboard and boot it. 

After login run:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudoedit /etc/network/interfaces.d/30_non-qubes-whonix
}}

and change the address and the gateway of eth0 corresponding to your local network / upstream router. 
As an example  our ISP router uses 192.168.0.1/24 for the internal network. The settings of eth0 would look like the following:

{{CodeSelect|code=
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
    address 192.168.0.11
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    gateway 192.168.0.1
}}


By default eth0 is the native ethernet connection of the RPI3. Hence, connect a network cable from there to your router. eth1 is the USB-ethernet adapter which should also be connected via cable to the computer running the workstation.
Since the RPI3 is lacking a real time clock you need to set the date manually to the current UTC time. Example:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo date -s "09 NOV 2019 17:00:00"
}}

Run:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo service networking restart
}}

and

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo service tor restart
}}

to connect to the Tor network.
Depending on your hypervisor you need to change network settings on the Workstation in order to connect it to the gateway (see below).

'''OPTIONAL - CUSTOMIZING FULL DISK ENCRYPTION'''

If you are interested in configuring a custom encryption algorithm to enhance security during the minimal installation of Debian {{Stable_project_version_based_on_Debian_codename}}, click on Expand on the right. 

<div class="mw-collapsible-content">

1. Under "Partitioning method", select Manual

2. Select the disk you are installing to and press enter, then select <Yes> to create a new empty partition table.

3. Select the "FREE SPACE" of the drive you are installing to, press Enter, "Create a new partition" should already be selected; press Enter again.

4. Now create a boot partition. This is the unencrypted partition your system boots from. The standard is 254.8 MB. Type "254.8 MB" (without the quotes) and press Enter.

5. Under "Type for the new partition:", Primary should already be selected, press Enter again; Under "Location for the new partition: "Beginning" should already be selected, press Enter again to go to the Partition settings screen.

Use the following settings for your boot partition:

<pre>

Use as:         Ext2 file system

Mount point:       /boot
Mount options:    noatime
Label:                 none
Reserved blocks:  5%
Typical Usage:     standard
Bootable flag:      on    

</pre>

Then select "Done setting up the partition" and press Enter, you will be brought back to the main partitioning menu.

6. Select "Configure encrypted volumes" and press Enter, then select <Yes> when asked to write the changes to disk and configure encrypted volumes.

7. Create encrypted volumes should already be selected, press Enter and select the free space of the drive you are installing to by pressing the spacebar, then select <Continue> and press Enter again. Additional components will load, then you will be brought to the configuration page for your encrypted partition. Here you can customize your encryption settings.

<pre>

Use as:      physical volume for encryption
Encryption method:   Device-mapper (dm-crypt)

Encryption: twofish 
[Recommend "twofish" and "serpent" as alternatives. "Serpent" is the slowest and only recommended if you have a fast system (and a fast drive), as it creates a lot of system overhead. "Twofish" is an algorithm created by Bruce Schneier, and is a lot faster, computationally-speaking. For most use-cases, "twofish" should be sufficient as an alternative algorithm]
Key size:     256 (leave as-is)
IV algorithm:  xts-plain64 
[for most use-cases, xts-plain64 should be sufficient. Do not change this unless you know what you are doing. You could inadvertently create a security hole]
Encryption key: Passphrase (leave as-is)
Erase data: yes (this will wipe the partition)
Bootable flag: off  

</pre>

8. After you have completed your configuration, select "Done setting up this partition", and press Enter, then select <Yes> and press enter to write the changes to disk, then on the next screen select "Finish", and press Enter. 

9. It is highly recommended that you erase the partition before you continue. Please note this may take a while for large drives. If you have already securely wiped your device before starting this installation, you can skip this step. To erase the partition, select <Yes> and press enter. 

10. Choose a strong password. This password should be at LEAST 26 characters, including symbols. Remember: the stronger your password, the stronger your encryption. The weaker the password, the weaker your encryption. After entering your password and confirming it, you will be brought back to the main partitioning menu.

11. Under your new "Encrypted volume" (which should be at the top of the list), highlight the partition that was just created under it (it should say ext4), and press Enter. Under "Use as:", change this to "physical volume for LVM", and press Enter, then select "Done setting up the partition", and press Enter again to be brought back to the main partitioning menu.

12. Now select "Configure the Logical Volume Manager" and press Enter. 

13. Highlight "Create volume group", and press Enter. Under "Volume group name:", enter HOST_VG, and press Enter.

14. Use the spacebar to select your encrypted partition, then select <Continue> and press Enter.

<pre>
(Optional) SWAP USERS:

O1. Now create your swap partition. Highlight "Create logical volume" and press Enter, then select HOST_VG and press Enter again. Type SWAP, press Enter.

O2. Enter your volume size (2.5 GB is usually a good standard size for most systems) then select <Continue> and press Enter.

</pre>

15. Highlight "Create logical volume" and press Enter, then select HOST_VG and press Enter again. Type ROOT, press Enter.

16. Under the "Logical volume size:", your entire volume should already be displayed, press Enter again. 

17. Highlight "Finish", then press Enter to be brought back to the main partitioning menu.

18. You should see your new partition for ROOT displayed on this screen [LVM VG HOST_VG, LV ROOT - xxx.x GB Linux device-mapper (linear)]. Select the partition underneath the heading and press Enter

19. Change "do not use" to the filing system of your choice. Ext4 is good for most installations. XFS is more suitable for filesystems on top of encryption and is more robust with better performance. For the purposes of this documentation, the following configuration is provided:

<pre>

Use as:             XFS journaling file system

Mount point:     / 
Mount options: defaults
Label:               none

</pre>

20. Once you're done, select "Done setting up this partition", and press Enter to return to the main partitioning menu.

<pre>
(Optional) SWAP USERS:

O1. You should see your new partition for SWAP displayed on this screen [LVM VG HOST_VG, LV SWAP - 2.5 GB Linux device-mapper (linear)]. Select the partition underneath the heading and press Enter.

O2. Change "do not use" to "swap area", and press Enter. Then select "Done setting up the partition" to return to the main partitioning menu.

</pre>

21. Highlight "Finish partitioning and write changes to disk" and press Enter, then select <Yes> when asked to confirm the changes. Your installation will continue automatically.

If you are using non-default network interface names, please click on Expand on the right. 
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
Should be doable using non-default network interface names as well. Not as easy. Not fully documented. Untested.

One way would be to figure out how to change a network interface name such as <code>wlan0</code> to <code>eth0</code>.

Otherwise you could consider to change the network interface names in the configuration files. To find the components that require configuration changes in the {{project name}} source folder, the following commands may be helpful. Should be really only a very few files. We used variables for eth0 and eth1 wherever possible.

<pre>
exclude="--exclude=README.md --exclude=control --exclude=changelog.upstream --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=whonix-developer-meta-files --exclude-dir=build-steps.d --exclude-dir=qubes-whonix"
</pre>

<pre>
grep $exclude -r eth0 ~/{{project_name_short}}
grep $exclude -r eth1 ~/{{project_name_short}}
</pre>

<pre>
grep -l $exclude -r eth0 ~/{{project_name_short}}
grep -l $exclude -r eth1 ~/{{project_name_short}}
</pre>

Should you decide to edit these files in {{project name}} source folder, note to apply the build parameters from [[#Source Code Changes]] as well.

Another, perhaps better option might be to change the network interface names after {{project name}} build script finished.

For example <code>/home/user/{{project_name_short}}/packages/whonix-ws-network-conf/etc/network/interfaces.d/30_non-qubes-whonix</code> becomes <code>/etc/network/interfaces.d/30_non-qubes-whonix</code>.

== Minor Things ==
<s>Most configuration files work well inside Virtual Machines and on hardware. Only minor things such as deactivating powersaving, passwordless reboot, shutdown etc. are only recommended for Virtual Machines. You can easily comment them out by putting a hash # in front of them. They are marked, to find them, grep can be used.</s> Skip this for now. You can change these files later after building {{project_name}}. (Simpler.)

<pre>
grep -r VMONLY* *
</pre>

== Run Build Script ==
It is recommended that you create a log of the build process by redirecting all the output to a log file. Be aware that by doing so no build progress will appear on the screen - instead a text log file will be created in your home folder. 

<pre>
sudo ./whonix_build --flavor whonix-gateway-xfce --target root --build >> ~/log-phyiso 2>&1
</pre>

To optionally watch the progress, open a second [[Desktop#Virtual_Consoles|virtual console]] and type.

<pre>
tail -f ~/log-phyiso
</pre>

If don't want to create a log of the build process (the build progress will then appear on screen) use the following command. 

'''This is not recommended because if anything goes wrong during the build, it will be harder to pinpoint the exact error without the actual log file.'''

<pre>
sudo ./whonix_build --flavor whonix-gateway --target root --build
</pre>

== Final Steps ==
Reboot.

<pre>
sudo reboot
</pre>

Login as new user "user". (If you didn't install as user "user", your old user and home folder does of course still exist.)

* This is untested since [https://phabricator.whonix.org/T347 use /etc/network/interfaces.d instead of /etc/network/interfaces] was implemented. Please test and leave feedback. [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/whonix-gw-network-conf whonix-gw-network-conf] ships a file [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/whonix-gw-network-conf/blob/master/etc/network/interfaces.d/30_non-qubes-whonix {{Code2|/etc/network/interfaces.d/30_non-qubes-whonix}}]. Usually it should not conflict with your {{Code2|/etc/network/interfaces}}. If it does, consider removing {{Code2|source-directory /etc/network/interfaces.d}} from {{Code2|/etc/network/interfaces}} (if there are no other files in {{Code2|/etc/network/interfaces.d}} folder) or moving {{Code2|/etc/network/interfaces.d/30_non-qubes-whonix}} out of the way. ({{Code2|sudo mv /etc/network/interfaces.d/30_non-qubes-whonix ~/}})

Done.

= How To Install {{gateway_product_name}} in a VM (UNTESTED / NOT RECOMMENDED) =

It is advised to install a new OS just for hosting the Gateway VM, any OS that can run VirtualBox works but we recommend an Open Source system.

[[Download]] the {{gateway_product_name}} image. (Or [[Dev/Build Documentation|build it]] from source code.)

Adapter 1 can be set up as a NAT network. Adapter 2 must either be set to NAT as well (but you will need to forward ports from the host to the guest) or much simpler: use bridged networking and set it to the second physical interface (the one that goes into the isolated network/point to point ethernet). See "NAT vs Bridging" below.

This configuration is entirely untested and not recommended unless you need to run Tor through an unsupported 3G modem and can't afford a 3rd physical device.

When using NAT for a virtualized Gateway you need to set up port forwarding in VirtualBox. Using bridged network may be easier, but then the router may see the {{gateway_product_name}} MAC address which identifies as {{gateway_product_name}}. (Should not be of concern in home networks. Should be of concern in untrusted networks or when using a modem to connect.)

= Install {{workstation_product_name}} in a VM (RECOMMENDED) =

=== First Steps ===

Install and update a host operating system. On the host can run any OS that is capable of running VirtualBox, but be aware of [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransparentProxyLeaks Transparent Proxy Leaks]. It is recommended against to use Windows or another other commercial proprietary system as host operating system.

[[Download]] the {{workstation_product_name}} image. (Or [[Dev/Build Documentation|build it]] from source code.)

Note sure what we wanted to say with this sentence: If the physical network (between {{gateway_product_name}} and a router) uses 10.152.152.* you need to review and edit all shell scripts and switch the internal network to something else!

=== Host Network Adapter ===

The host has to be configured to use the static IP configuration.

<pre>
## {{workstation_product_name}}
## /etc/network/interfaces for the host,
## when using Physical Isolation,
## with {{workstation_product_name}} in a VM.

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
   ## Increment last octet of address
   ## on optional additional hosts.
   address 10.152.152.11 
   netmask 255.255.192.0
   gateway 10.152.152.10
   #pre-up /usr/bin/whonix_firewall

   ## Out commented.
   ## For what do we require the network and broadcast
   ## instances anyway?
   #network 10.152.152.0
   #broadcast 10.152.152.255

#auto eth0
#iface eth0 inet dhcp

## end of /etc/network/interfaces
</pre>

If the physical network (between {{gateway_product_name}} and a router) uses 10.152.152.* you need to review and edit all ''/etc/network/interfaces''.

=== NAT vs Bridging ===

==== Two Choices ====

In the default {{project name}} VirtualBox image, the network adapter setting for Adapter 1 (eth0) is set to internal network and will therefore not work out of the box. There are two choices to fix this. NAT (recommended) or bridged network.

==== NAT (RECOMMENDED) ====

If you use NAT you will have to edit the ''/etc/network/interfaces'' in {{workstation_product_name}} to use DHCP (easier, shown in the example below) or a static IP for VirtualBox NAT.

<pre>
sudoedit /etc/network/interfaces
</pre>

Replace it with.

<pre>
## {{workstation_product_name}}
## /etc/network/interfaces in a VM
## when using Physical Isolation.

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

## end of /etc/network/interfaces
</pre>

==== Bridged Network (UNTESTED / NOT RECOMMENDED) ====

If you use bridged networking things will (or should, we haven't tested anything yet) just work.

Since in the bridged network case, {{workstation_product_name}} can see the MAC address of whatever network adapter it is connected to, you should change the MAC address of the Workstation host and of the {{gateway_product_name}}.

See [[Pre_Install_Advice#MAC_Address|{{project_name}} in public networks]].

==== Macvtap on KVM ====

Change the network source of the ethernet nic to "macvtap" and the source mode to "passthrough"
Be aware, you can't use networking on the host anymore.

==== Attach an USB-ethernet adapter to the VM ====

Remove the network adapter from the VM and instead attach an USB-ethernet adapter to the host and redirect it to the VM.

= Install {{workstation_product_name}} on hardware (NOT RECOMMENDED) =

Install {{workstation_product_name}} on hardware without using a VM is recommended against, because hardware serials would be visible to {{workstation_product_name}}.

The instructions are very similar, if not the very same, to those in "How To Install {{gateway_product_name}} on hardware" above. You have to use {{Code2|--flavor whonix-workstation}} instead of {{Code2|--flavor whonix-gateway}}.

= Security and Support Status =
{{project_name}} Physical Isolation has no dedicated [[Contribute#Contributor|contributor]]. It is a leftover from previous times, where no other [[Download|supported platforms]] were supported. This setup, these instructions still work. Some users are still using them. But Patrick's focus has now moved to [[Qubes]]. Grave security issues are unlikely due to {{project name}} design. There is no [[Contributors|{{project_name}} contributors]] member testing {{project name}} physical isolation. No progress on the [https://phabricator.whonix.org/maniphest/?statuses=open%28%29&projects=PHID-PROJ-f6ufodh4cac5ursi7kcq#R {{project name}} Physical Isolation development task list] should be expected. That's why the [[Download|supported platforms table]] lists Physical Isolation in the column 'security' with 'experimental'.

= Help Wanted =
* work on the [https://phabricator.whonix.org/maniphest/?statuses=open%28%29&projects=PHID-PROJ-f6ufodh4cac5ursi7kcq#R {{project name}} Physical Isolation development task list] (not even filled up)
* Become {{project name}} Physical Isolation [[Contribute#Contributor|contributor]] so the [[#Security and Support Status]] can be improved.
