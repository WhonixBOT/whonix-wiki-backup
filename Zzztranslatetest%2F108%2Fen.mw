Whonix is an operating system focused on anonymity, privacy and security. It is based on the Tor anonymity network<tvar| ><ref>https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en</ref></>, Debian GNU/Linux<tvar| ><ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian</ref></> and security by isolation. DNS leaks are impossible, and not even malware with root privileges can find out the user's real IP.
