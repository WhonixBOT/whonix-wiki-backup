= Rationale = 

Although whonixcheck already has apparmor and systemd hardening, some marginal security and anonymity benefits are gained by reducing: the number of network connections, the amount of code running, and [[General_Host_Security#Attack_Surface_Reduction|unnecessary functionality]]. This is not the default configuration, since that would come at the cost of decreased usability for the entire {{project_name}} population.

= Hardening Steps =

== Prevent Autostart ==

To prevent whonixcheck from automatically starting, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl mask whonixcheck
}}

{{Anchor|Prevent Downloading {{project_name}} News}}

{{Anchor|Prevent_Downloading_Whonix_.E2.84.A2_News_and_Whonix_.E2.84.A2_User_Census_Counting}}
== Prevent {{project_name}} User Census Counting ==

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = {{gateway_product_name}} only.
}}

This will prevent the anonymous, daily {{project_name}} census. <ref>
https://phabricator.whonix.org/T689
</ref> <ref>
There are strict requirements for the {{project_name}} user count:

<blockquote>
* no private info transferred at all
* adds no additional risk other than that of apt-get communicating with {{project_name}} servers which users are doing anyway to their systems updated
* only on {{gateway_product_name}}
* no unique identifiers of any kind
* all transmissions go through Tor
* all transmissions are using {{project name}} Tor onion v3 service
* so we will never collect any IP addresses
* submissions happen at randomized times
* only one submission within 24 hours 
* can be easily disabled

{{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/whonix.d/50_user.conf

Add the following content.

{{CodeSelect|code=

== Prevent Polluting TransPort ==
{{mbox
| type      = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = {{workstation_product_name}} only.
}}

{{mbox
| type      = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = Only useful when running <code>whonixcheck --leak-tests</code>. On the other hand, running <code>whonixcheck --leak-tests</code> with the Tor <code>TransPort</code> test disabled makes little sense. In that case it would would be useful as a Tor <code>SocksPort</code> connectivity test.
}}

Deactivate the <code>TransPort</code> Test for better [[Stream Isolation]].

{{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/whonix.d/50_user.conf
}}

Add the following content.

{{CodeSelect|code=
WHONIXCHECK_DISABLE_TRANS_PORT_TEST="1"
}}

Save.

== Prevent Running apt-get ==

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = Complete these steps on ''both'' {{gateway_product_name}} and {{workstation_product_name}}.
}}

This prevents the running of apt-get by whonixcheck.

{{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/whonix.d/50_user.conf
}}

Add the following content.

{{CodeSelect|code=
whonixcheck_skip_functions+=" check_operating_system "
}}

== Prevent torproject.org Connections ==

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = Complete these steps on ''both'' {{gateway_product_name}} and {{workstation_product_name}}.
}}

Deactivate SocksPort Test, TransPort Test and Tor Browser Update check.

{{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/whonix.d/50_user.conf
}}

Add the following content.

{{CodeSelect|code=
WHONIXCHECK_DISABLE_SOCKS_PORT_TEST="1"
WHONIXCHECK_DISABLE_TRANS_PORT_TEST="1"
whonixcheck_skip_functions+=" check_torbrowser "
}}

Save.
