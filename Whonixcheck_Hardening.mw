= Rationale = 

Although whonixcheck already has apparmor and systemd hardening, some marginal security and anonymity benefits are gained by reducing: the number of network connections, the amount of code running, and [[Advanced_Host_Security#Attack_Surface_Reduction|unnecessary functionality]]. This is not the default configuration, since that would come at the cost of decreased usability for the entire {{project_name}} population.

= Hardening Steps =

== Prevent Autostart ==

To prevent whonixcheck from automatically starting, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl mask whonixcheck
}}

{{Anchor|Prevent Downloading {{project_name}} News}}

{{Anchor|Prevent_Downloading_Whonix_.E2.84.A2_News_and_Whonix_.E2.84.A2_User_Census_Counting}}
== Prevent {{project_name}} User Census Counting ==

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = {{gateway_product_name}} only.
}}

This will prevent the anonymous, daily {{project_name}} census. <ref>
https://phabricator.whonix.org/T689
</ref> <ref>
There are strict requirements for the {{project_name}} user count:

* no private info transferred at all
* adds no additional risk other than that of apt-get communicating with {{project_name}} servers which users are doing anyway to their systems updated
* only on {{gateway_product_name}}
* no unique identifiers of any kind
* all transmissions go through Tor
* all transmissions are using {{project name}} Tor onion v3 service
* no IP addresses are ever collected
* only one submission within 24 hours 
* can be easily disabled
* secured through an AppArmor profile and systemd hardening (seccomp) by default
* inspired by [https://cleaninsights.org Clean Insights (Privacy-Preserving Measurement)] by [https://guardianproject.info Guardian Project]
</ref> <ref>
Rationale for {{project_name}} user count:

* Feedback for maintainers of {{project name}} if the number of {{project name}} users increases over time.
* Some people decide based on impact to which project these would like to [[contribute]].
* Capability to answer questions such as does {{project name}} have more users than lets say for example a project which was founded a year ago.
* Comparison of number of users of Tor, Tails, {{project name}}.
* Users can decide if these would like to share the same [[Fingerprint]] as 100 or thousands of other users.
* Planned future enhancement: the same mechanism can be used to automatically verify [[Trust#{{project name short}}_.E2.84.A2_Warrant_Canary|{{project name}} warrant canary]].

Add the following content.

== Prevent Polluting TransPort ==
{{mbox

| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = {{workstation_product_name}} only.
}}

{{mbox
| type      = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = Only useful when running <code>whonixcheck --leak-tests</code>. On the other hand, running <code>whonixcheck --leak-tests</code> with the Tor <code>TransPort</code> test disabled makes little sense. In that case it would would be useful as a Tor <code>SocksPort</code> connectivity test.
}}

Deactivate the <code>TransPort</code> Test for better [[Stream Isolation]].

{{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/whonix.d/50_user.conf
}}

Add the following content.

{{CodeSelect|code=
WHONIXCHECK_DISABLE_TRANS_PORT_TEST="1"
}}

Save.

== Prevent Running apt-get ==

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = Complete these steps on ''both'' {{gateway_product_name}} and {{workstation_product_name}}.
}}

This prevents the running of apt-get by whonixcheck.

{{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/whonix.d/50_user.conf
}}

Add the following content.

{{CodeSelect|code=
whonixcheck_skip_functions+=" check_operating_system "
}}

== Prevent torproject.org Connections ==
Default. No action required.

whonixcheck would only connect to <code>torproject.org</code> if the user would manually run <code>whonixcheck --leak-tests</code>.
