[[image:{{project_name_short}}checkhard.jpg|thumb]]
= Rationale = 

Although whonixcheck already has apparmor and systemd hardening, some marginal security and anonymity benefits are gained by reducing: the number of network connections, the amount of code running, and [[General_Host_Security#Attack_Surface_Reduction|unnecessary functionality]]. This is not the default configuration, since that would come at the cost of decreased usability for the entire {{project_name}} population.

= Hardening Steps =

== Prevent Autostart ==

To prevent whonixcheck from automatically starting, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl mask whonixcheck
}}

{{Anchor|Prevent Downloading {{project_name}} News}}

== Prevent Downloading {{project_name}} News and {{project_name}} User Census Counting ==

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = Complete these steps on ''both'' {{gateway_product_name}} and {{workstation_product_name}}.
}}

This will prevent downloading of [[Download#{{project_name}}_Version_Check_and_{{project_name_short}}_News|{{project_name}} News]] and the anonymous, daily {{project_name}} census. <ref>
https://phabricator.whonix.org/T689
</ref> <ref>
There are strict requirements for the {{project_name}} user count: <blockquote>- no private info transferred at all <br />
- adds no additional risk other than that of apt-get communicating with {{project_name}} servers which users are doing anyway to their systems updated <br />
- only on {{gateway_product_name}} <br />
- no unique identifiers of any kind <br />
- all transmissions go through Tor <br />
- all transmissions are using {{project name}} Tor onion v3 service <br />
- so we will never collect any IP addresses <br />
- submissions happen at randomized times <br />
- only one submission within 24 hours <br />
- can be easily disabled

== Prevent Polluting TransPort ==

{{mbox

Deactivate the TransPort Test for better [[Stream Isolation]].

{{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/whonix.d/50_user.conf
}}

Add the following content.

{{CodeSelect|code=
WHONIXCHECK_DISABLE_TRANS_PORT_TEST="1"
}}

== Prevent Running apt-get ==

{{mbox

| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = Complete these steps on ''both'' {{gateway_product_name}} and {{workstation_product_name}}.
}}

This prevents the running of apt-get by whonixcheck.

}}

Deactivate SocksPort Test, TransPort Test and Tor Browser Update check.
