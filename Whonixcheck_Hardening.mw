}}

= Rationale = 

Although whonixcheck already has apparmor and systemd hardening, some marginal security and anonymity benefits are gained by reducing: the number of network connections, the amount of code running, and [[General_Host_Security#Attack_Surface_Reduction|unnecessary functionality]]. This is not the default configuration, since that would come at the cost of decreased usability for the entire Whonix population.

= Hardening Steps =

== Prevent Autostart ==

To prevent whonixcheck from automatically starting, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl mask whonixcheck
}}

{{Anchor|Prevent Downloading Whonix News}}

== Prevent Downloading Whonix News and Whonix User Census Counting ==

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = Complete these steps on ''both'' {{gateway_product_name}} and {{workstation_product_name}}.
}}


This will prevent downloading of [[Download#Whonix_Version_Check_and_Whonix_News|Whonix News]] and the anonymous, daily Whonix census. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T689</ref> <ref>There are strict requirements for the Whonix user count: <blockquote>- no private info transferred at all <br />
- adds no additional risk other than that of apt-get communicating with Whonix servers which users are doing anyway to their systems updated <br />
- only on Whonix-Gateway <br />
- no unique identifiers of any kind <br />
- all transmissions go through Tor <br />
- all transmissions are using {{project name}} Tor onion v3 service <br />
- so we will never collect any IP addresses <br />
- submissions happen at randomized times <br />
- only one submission within 24 hours <br />
- can be easily disabled</blockquote>

== Prevent Polluting TransPort ==

== Prevent Running apt-get ==

{{mbox

| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = Complete these steps on ''both'' {{gateway_product_name}} and {{workstation_product_name}}.
