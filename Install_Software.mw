[[Qubes|{{q_project_name}}]] users need to [https://qubes-os.org/doc/software-update-vm/ install and update persistant software] in the {{workstation_product_name}} TemplateVM(s) (<code>{{whonix-ws}}</code>). 
-----
Using ''apt-get'' in the a TemplateBased AppVM (<code>anon-whonix</code>) will only install software for the current session, with changes being lost when the VM is shut down; see [[#Install_Software_in_a_TemplateBasedVM|Install Software in a TemplateBasedVM]].
}}

A primary {{project name}} goal is to greatly reduce the risk posed by (additional) software installations that are not exclusively designed to work with Tor.

Users can install any software inside {{workstation_product_name}} using [[#APT|apt-get]], since it is [[Support#Free_Support_Principle|based on Debian]]. However, this is <i>not</i> a recommendation for installing additional software. Also, {{project_name}} is currently the most secure platform for running Tor-unsafe applications like the former Adobe Flash plugin (now deprecated); see the [[Comparison_with_Others#Flash_.2F_Browser_Plugin_Security|operating system comparison]].

The [[Software|{{project_name}} software]] page lists:

* pre-installed {{project name}} applications which are available for different tasks
* recommended software for different user activities
* safety advice
* installation instructions

== Install from Debian stable ==
To install a package from Debian stable, follow the steps below. Replace <code>package-name</code> with the name of the software to be installed.

{{Install_Package
|package=package-name
}}

There are numerous examples of this procedure in the [[Software]] chapter and throughout the wiki.

'''Table:''' ''Best Software Installation Practices''

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! scope="col"| '''Domain'''
! scope="col"| '''Advice'''
|-
! scope="row"| Always Verify Signatures
| 
* For greater system security, it is strongly recommended to avoid installing unsigned software. Always make sure that [[Verifying_Software_Signatures|signing keys and signatures are correct]] and/or use mechanisms that heavily simplify and automate this process, like [[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates#Updates|apt-get upgrades]].
* Note: digital signatures are not a magic bullet. While they increase the certainty that no backdoor was introduced by a third party during transit, this does not mean the software is absolutely "backdoor-free". Learn more about this process and [[Verifying_Software_Signatures#What_Digital_Signatures_Prove|what digital signatures prove]].
|-
! scope="row"| Avoid Manual Software Installation
| 
* Generally avoid the manual installation of packages, even trusted ones. In practice that means software should only be installed with <code>apt-get</code>, unless special circumstances exist. <ref>
Such as desirable software versions that are not yet bundled in the official repositories.
</ref>
* Other risks: foreign packages are often unsigned, and users may forget to regularly update the software.
|-
! scope="row"| Avoid Third Party Package Managers
| 
* There are many third party package managers besides <code>APT</code>, however many lack the security safeguards that are standard in Debian. Popular examples are <code>pip</code> and <code>node.js</code>.
* The security concern with third party options is they do not verify the code comes from the author. When used, these package managers run processes that pull untrusted code from the Internet and perform operations with root level permissions.
* If a trusted Workstation VM is required for sensitive use cases such as a Bitcoin wallet, then completely avoid this option. <ref>
https://web.archive.org/web/20170919173146/https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/09/devs-unknowingly-use-malicious-modules-put-into-official-python-repository/
</ref> <ref>
The pip developers refused to implement any kind of proper GPG signature verification, [https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/1035 opting to support server HTTPS instead] which is a lot weaker. While the TUF secure updater project has [https://theupdateframework.github.io/ implemented a safe version of pip], it is not clear how widely it has been adopted and whether it will become popular.
</ref>
|-
! scope="row"| Prefer APT
| 
* The safest option is to stick with Debian's official package manager <code>APT</code>. This is referenced throughout the wiki whenever the user runs <code>apt-get</code>.
* <code>APT</code> is a secure package manager which passes the TUF threat model, since it features metadata verification and expiration detection. <ref name=tufaaw>https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/develop/SECURITY.md http://www.webcitation.org/6F7Io2ncN

{{Anchor|Prefer Packages from Debian Stable Repository}}
! scope="row"| Prefer Packages from Debian Stable Repository
| 
* Considering the risks, it is safest to install new software from Debian's stable repository, rather than the testing / unstable or third party repositories -- the [https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/ch-choosing.en.html#s3.1 Debian FAQ] provides a strong rationale for using the stable repository; see footnote. <ref>
<blockquote>If security or stability are at all important for you: install stable. period. This is the most preferred way.
...
Since there is typically over 1 year between releases you might find that stable contains old versions of packages. However, they have been tested in and out. One can confidently say that the packages do not have any known severe bugs, security holes etc., in them. The packages in stable integrate seamlessly with other stable packages. These characteristics are very important for production servers which have to work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 
...
Stable is rock solid. It does not break and has full security support. But it might not have support for the latest hardware.

On the other hand, packages in testing or unstable can have hidden bugs, security holes etc. Moreover, some packages in testing and unstable might not be working as intended.</blockquote>
</ref>
* Only advanced users should attempt to mix packages from Debian testing or Debian unstable. The reason is it can lead to a [[#Dependency Hell|dependency hell]], making it very difficult to resolve the breakage of APT package management.
* To use newer package versions, see chapter [[#Install Newer Software Versions|Install Newer Software Versions]].

= More Security =

== General Advice ==

{{project_name}} users are free to install their favorite software packages, but should be aware that additional software increases the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface attack surface] of the platform. Almost any application can be installed, with a few exceptions for programs that are [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO#Howtotorifyspecificprograms impossible to torify]. In addition, {{project name}} provides:

* protection from IP and DNS leaks (see above for details)
* partial protection against [[Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection|protocol leaks and fingerprinting]], but this is far from perfect

Users are responsible for trying to prevent any other [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO#Protocolleaks protocol leaks] using the [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO "Torify: How-to" guide], but most of those are mitigated by {{project_name}}.

== apt-get Meta-data ==

When updating with <code>apt-get</code>, information will leak about which software packages and versions have been installed, unless [[Onionizing_Repositories|Tor onion repositories]] have been configured. <ref>See [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO#Softwareupdaters software updaters] for more information on this topic.</ref> This meta-data cannot be directly linked to any other activity like web browsing, because the {{project name}} <i>apt-get</i> uwt wrapper forces it to pass through its own circuit. Despite this isolation, it is still possible for updates to be [[Stream Isolation|correlated]] with the same pseudonym. <ref>Consider the following example. A user announces online that software X is being utilized, and another specific application set x, y, and z is installed. If this information becomes available to an adversary and the circuit-isolated <i>apt-get</i> passes through any Tor exit relays, mirrors or ISPs under their control, then they may guess it is associated with the same pseudonym. In that case, the adversary has a list of the user's installed packages, and can attempt a stale mirror attack (if the user has a [[Ubuntu Tips#About_Ubuntu|custom Ubuntu build]]), or try other attacks against <i>apt-get</i>.</ref> <ref>As per the previous footnote, this threat equally applies to users who run an onion service with a specific set of server software, for example apache, mediawiki, phpbb, and others.</ref>

== Recommendations ==

For greater security when updating:

* Follow the guidelines [[#How to install or update with most caution?|below]].
* Be especially careful when adding custom repositories, particularly Personal Package Archives (PPAs).<ref>[https://itsfoss.com/ppa-guide/ Using PPA in Ubuntu Linux (Complete Guide)]: <blockquote>PPA stands for Personal Package Archive. The PPA allows application developers and Linux users to create their own repositories to distribute software. With PPA, you can easily get newer software version or software that are not available via the official Ubuntu repositories.</blockquote></ref> Compared to main distribution repositories, solo developers are more susceptible to influence and theoretically might have malicious intent.
* Read the [[Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection|protocol leak and fingerprinting protection]] entry first. It highlights useful information, like the fact that DNS and IP-related leaks do not apply to {{project_name}}.
* Refer to the Tor Project's [https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/TorifyHOWTO Torify: How-to] which discusses various [https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/TorifyHOWTO#Protocolleaks protocol leaks] and how to mitigate them.
* Review the Tor Project's [https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/TransparentProxyLeaks Transparent Proxy Leaks] documentation, which is particularly relevant for Microsoft Windows.

== How-to: Install or Update with Utmost Caution ==

# Stop all activities and shutdown any open applications like Tor Browser.
# Change the Tor circuit -- this step may not apply if the user is running an onion service. <ref>One option is using [[Tor Controller|Arm]]: <code>Navigate to {{gateway_product_name}} ([[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]]: sys-whonix)</code> &rarr; <code>Select
Arm - Tor Controller</code> &rarr; <code>Press "n" for a New Identity</code>. <br /> Alternatively: <code>Press "m" for the menu</code> &rarr; <code>Scroll down to "New Identity"</code> &rarr; <code>Press "Enter"</code>.</ref>
# Update using <code>apt-get</code> after a random delay. By default, a new Tor circuit is generated after 10 seconds.
# Change the Tor circuit again.
# Continue user activities after another random period has elapsed.

== Install Newer Software Versions ==
Prerequisite knowledge: From page [[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates|Operating System Software and Updates]] chapter [[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates#Frozen_Packages|Frozen Packages]].

It might be possible to install newer software versions for some applications.

One option, if available are [[#Backports|backports]]. Another option might be manual software installation.

For some applications such as Electrum or Monero where the user intents to use newer versions it is a better approach to not conceptualize about the process of being an "application update" but rather "application installation".

A Debian package for a large part is just a vehicle to place files into some location. For example the [https://gitlab.com/whonix/binaries-freedom <code>binaries-freedom</code> Debian package] in {{project name}} ships electrum. It comes with the appimage file (<code>/usr/share/binaries-freedom/electrum-appimage/electrum-4.0.7-x86_64.AppImage</code>) and a start menu entry (<code>/usr/share/applications/electrum-appimage.desktop</code>). The presence of these files does not limit the ability of the user to customize the system such as installing newer versions of the software. The user is free to ignore these files. I.e. not use the electrum-appimage start menu entry. The purpose of the <code>binaries-freedom</code> package is to improve usability. It was never designed to limit the user's freedom of customization and neither has such side effects. As per {{project name}} policy there are [[Why_{{project_name_short}}_is_Freedom_Software#no_intentional_user_freedom_restrictions|No Intentional User Freedom Restrictions]]. This concept could be coined "ignore {{project name short}} modifications method".

Another way to think of this could be:

# [[Electrum#Uninstallation|uninstall <code>binaries-freedom</code> (electrum appimage)]]
# install electrum appimage

How to install custom software? For better security, follow the recommendations on this whole page generally. As for actual instructions for custom software installation, this vary per application. This is mostly unspecific to {{project name}}. Therefore installation is recommended as per [[Free Support Principle]].

If if the user is a user of {{Q project name}} then it is additionally recommended to rephrase the question to "How would I do this with a Debian based Qubes template?" Also as per Free Support Principle.

== Backports ==
[http://backports.debian.org Debian Backports]:

<blockquote>Backports are packages taken from the next Debian release (called "testing"), adjusted and recompiled for usage on Debian stable.</blockquote>

This is a far safer alternative than the Debian testing or unstable repositories. However, Debian backports should be used conservatively.

<blockquote>Backports cannot be tested as extensively as Debian stable, and backports are provided on an as-is basis, with risk of incompatibilities with other components in Debian stable. Use with care!</blockquote>

Before completing steps in this section, first read [[#Prefer Packages from Debian Stable Repository|Prefer Packages from Debian Stable Repository]]. Carefully check how packages will change before proceeding -- a host of upgrades is usually safe, but no {{project name}} packages should be removed as part of the process; see [[{{project name short}} Debian Packages]]. Be aware that problems are still possible - see [https://forums.whonix.org/t/modulenotfounderror-no-module-named-distutils-spawn/6826 here] for an example. 

It is recommended to complete this process in a [[Multiple_{{workstation_product_name_short}}|separate {{workstation_product_name}}]] (<code>{{whonix-ws}}-debian-testing-mix</code>) due to the risks. Ask for advice in the forums on a case-by-case basis.
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Boot the {{workstation_product_name}} (<code>{{whonix-ws}}-debian-testing-mix</code>) TemplateVM.

'''2.''' Add the current Debian testing codename <code>{{Debian_Codename_Testing}}</code> to ''sources.list'' 

Note: this applies to {{project name}} 14. Later {{project name}} versions may use a codename different to <code>{{Debian_Codename_Testing}}</code>.

In the {{workstation_product_name}} (<code>{{whonix-ws}}-debian-testing-mix</code>) TemplateVM, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo su -c "echo -e 'deb http://http.debian.net/debian {{Debian_Codename_Testing}} main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/testing.list"

'''4.''' Install the select software.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get -t {{Debian_Codename_Testing}} install packagename
}}

* Replace <code>packagename</code> with the package you actually want to install.

The procedure is now complete.

'''5.''' Undo.

On occasion it is necessary to undo this configuration, for example when upgrading from Debian <code>{{Stable_project_version_based_on_Debian_codename}}</code> to <code>{{Debian_Codename_Testing}}</code>. <ref>Most often this step applies before attempting major {{project name}} upgrades; upgrade instructions are also made available at that time (see [[Stay_Tuned|Stay Tuned]]).</ref> To proceed, run.

== Package Reinstallation ==
As per the [[Support#Free_Support_Principle|free support principle]], package reinstallation utilizes normal Debian processes.

The example below shows how the {{Code2|thunderbird}} package would be reinstalled. It is possible to  substitute {{Code2|thunderbird}} with many other packages, so long as they do not have too many dependencies. These instructions are not suitable for any packages needed for connectivity such as {{Code2|tor}}, because the reinstallation would be very difficult and is currently [[unsupported]].

Even in the {{Code2|thunderbird}} package example, dependency complications emerge. The {{Code2|anon-workstation-packages-recommended}} package also depends on {{Code2|thunderbird}}. Further, the {{Code2|whonix-workstation}} package depends on {{Code2|anon-workstation-packages-recommended}}.
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Update the package lists and upgrade. 

See [[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates#Updates|Updates]] for instructions.

'''2.''' Purge the package you want to reinstall.

{{CodeSelect|code=

The output will show something like the following.

== Install Software in a TemplateBasedVM ==

{{mbox
| type      = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = [[Qubes|{{q_project_name}}]] only! Custom scripting is recommended, which is beyond the scope of this entry. Numerous free articles and instructions can be easily found with a search engine.   
}}

There is no reason to avoid installing software in [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/glossary/#templatebasedvm TemplateBasedVMs], although software installed this way will not persist across reboots. Users can opt to use a custom script to automate this process, thereby minimizing time spent re-installing packages. 

=== Advantages ===

This software installation method means a single [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/glossary/#vm VM] assumes many of the positive characteristics found in both TemplateBasedVMs and [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/glossary/#standalonevm StandaloneVMs].

*<u>Centralized Updates:</u> [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/glossary/#templatebasedvm AppVMs] are based on a [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/glossary/#templatebasedvm TemplateVM]. This means the AppVM's root filesystem is based on the corresponding template's root filesystem. Users need only update the TemplateVM and those updates will be reflected in the TemplateBasedVM's root filesystem upon restart.<ref name="qubes-software">[https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/software-update-vm/ Qubes install software]</ref>
*<u>Minimal Disk Usage:</u> TemplateBasedVMs require much less disk space than StandaloneVMs, since the AppVM's root filesystem is based the corresponding template. The AppVM only requires enough disk space to hold user files in the <code>/home</code> directory.
*<u>Semi-persistent Storage:</u> User data stored in <code>/home</code> , <code>/rw</code> and <code>/usr/local</code> survives reboot. Many applications like [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Signal Signal] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_(software) Wire] store user data in the <code>/home</code> folder. Since the custom script installs the software seamlessly with little or no user interaction, the AppVM has <i>"quasi-full persistence"</i>, not unlike a StandaloneVM's full persistence.

=== AppVM Preparation ===
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Create an AppVM based on <code>{{whonix-ws}}</code>.

'''2.''' Pre-install any necessary dependencies.

Dependencies are available from [https://packages.debian.org/stable/ packages.debian.org] and can be pre-installed in the TemplateVM to speed up the repetitive software installation process. This means only packages or software missing from [https://packages.debian.org/stable packages.debian.org] will be repeatedly installed in the AppVM.

'''3.''' Create a custom script that runs at VM boot. 

The purpose of this script is to automate software installation that would otherwise require manual user steps. Note that script functionality is variable, dependent on the software packages being installed and the experience of the user.

Scripting is useful for common tasks such as:  

* Adding specific software repositories.
* Importing verified signing keys.
* Updating the package list with <code>apt-get update</code>, after the repository and signing key are imported.
* Finally running <code>apt-get install</code> to install the relevant software package(s).
}}

=== AppVM Use ===

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text    = The AppVM's root filesystem does not provide a strong [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/software-update-vm/#note-on-treating-appvms-root-filesystem-non-persistence-as-a-security-feature non-persistent security feature]. The persistence of the <code>/home</code>, <code>/rw</code>, and <code>/usr/local</code> filesystem means malware can be specifically written to target Qubes-based AppVMs, inserting hooks inside these directory's files. <ref>https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/software-update-vm/#note-on-treating-appvms-root-filesystem-non-persistence-as-a-security-feature</ref> <ref>Obvious hook targets include .bashrc, the Firefox profile directory (which contains extensions), or PDF or DOC documents that are likely to be opened by the user.</ref>
}}

Once user preparation is complete and the AppVM is started, it will automatically start the script to begin installing software. When the process finishes, the AppVM can be used like any other TemplateBasedVM. However when the AppVM is shutdown, all data outside of the persistent <code>/home</code> folder will be lost, including the newly installed software packages. Following reboot, the VM will again install the software packages automatically.

=== Using bind-dirs Selective Persistence ===

Using selective [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/bind-dirs/ bind-dirs] persistence is currently a difficult problem and undocumented. Further research is required to ascertain which files require persistence across VM reboots.

The same would probably also happen in any other Qubes TempalteVMs such as for example in a Debian TempalteVM. As per [[Free Support Principle]] is recommend to make snap work in a non-Whonix based TemplateVM first such as a Debian TemplateVM before attempting to do the same inside {{project name}}.

=== flatpak Package Manager Security ===
Comparison by security features <ref>
Features. Not source code.
</ref> (such as signed metadata) alone, flatpak package manager security is comparable to Debian's APT package manager security with a caveat. [https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/4031#issuecomment-748891490 Flatpak currently does not defend against <code>indefinite freeze attacks</code>].

Definition of <code>indefinite freeze attacks</code> according to the {{TUF4}}:

<blockquote>Indefinite freeze attacks. An attacker continues to present files to a software update system files that the client has already seen. As a result, the client is kept unaware of new files.</blockquote>

This attack is difficult to pull-off for many adversaries since it requires breaking [[SSL|TLS]]. While flatpak package version information are not protected by a [https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/4031#issuecomment-753581447 <code>valid-until</code> field] these are fetched over TLS. Even if an adversary could break TLS, this would be lesser of an issue <u>tor</u>ified connections (such as by {{Whonix}}) since the adversary could not mount a targeted indefinite freeze attack against a specific user. Only against all Tor users, which would likely be caught, unless the adversary also has the ability to break Tor. The attack chain would be very complex. Break Tor &rarr; target specific user(s) &rarr; break TLS &rarr; mount indefinite freeze attack &rarr; exploit vulnerability due to indefinite freeze attack caused outdated software version.

To work around this issue, users would have to manually check if their version numbers of their flatpak installed applications match the version numbers available from the flathub repository. Every application available from flathub has a corresponding website has a chapter <code>Additional information</code> with entries <code>Updated</code> and <code>Version</code>. For example for [[Chromium]] there is the [https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.chromium.Chromium org.chromium.Chromium flathub website] which at the time of writing this wiki chapter showed. <code>Updated</code> <code>December 23, 2020</code>, <code>Version</code> <code>87.0.4280.88-1</code>. Since researching version information on the flathub website is equally vulnerable to indefinite freeze attacks as the flathub package manager itself (both rely on TLS), it is recommended to use {{Whonix}} or Tor Browser for this purpose. <ref>
In theory, some adversaries are capable to mount a indefinite freeze attack against all visitors coming from the Tor network but this ever happening might be unlikely. Such an attack is likely to get spotted eventually which would lead to it being widely publicized and presumably responded to by major improvements on how encrypted/authenticated connections are done over the internet generally.

Sometimes versions available through APT are too old, even have known vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild, for a long time. ([[Dev/Chromium#Remotely_Exploitable_Chromium_Security_Vulnerability_CVE-2021-21193_exploited_in_the_wild|example]]) On the other hand, flatpak most of the time, offers more recent software versions and/or deploys security fixes in a more timely manner.

Due to the complex attack chain, the advantages of flatpak outweigh the severity of potential indefinite freeze attacks since flatpak is sometimes the only trustworthy, easy to use source of software (or never versions) than what Debian [[#Install_from_Debian_stable|stable]] (with [[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates#Frozen_Packages|Frozen Packages]]) (or [[#Install Newer Software Versions|newer]]) is offering.

=== Forum Discussion ===
General forum discussion about flatpak and flathub: [https://forums.whonix.org/t/flatpak-as-a-software-source-flathub-as-a-source-of-software/8500 flathub as a source of software].

= Foreign Sources =

In most cases, the extensive software range available from the official Debian repositories should be enough to satisfy the user's needs. A selection of more than 50,000 programs can be installed within a couple of steps. These packages are constantly maintained for bug/security fixes and tightly integrated to provide a stable distribution. 

To guarantee stability, no new versions are uploaded to Debian stable archives to avoid breaking the system. This makes Debian stable a dependable distribution and an excellent base for downstream distributions. However, the Linux software scene is very dynamic and sometimes the user will want software that is not yet packaged in Debian. In this instance, it may be necessary to install software from separate sources; either from third party repositories, as a stand-alone precompiled <i>.deb</i> binary, or directly compiled source packages. <ref>https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/ch-pkg_basics.en.html</ref>

== Risks ==
The use of foreign sources should be kept to a minimum, as it may cause problems. Note this is simply a warning about the worst case scenario and not a predetermined outcome of installing third party software.

=== Security Issues ===
Keep in mind that foreign sources pose important security implications for the user's system. Installing software is tantamount to granting root privileges to the developers. Software originating from dubious sources could replace important system components with malicious versions that allow backdoors or [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_%28computing%29 Trojan horses] to be installed on the system.

In general, the installation of software is a matter of trust. The fact is that users have to trust every software source they install. This trust is two-fold: firstly that the developers have integrity, and secondly that the community will notice any suspicious code, which might indicate compromise of the developers' machines. <ref>With reproducible package builds on the horizon, the security risk from the second factor will be minimal in the future.</ref>

=== Dependency Hell ===
Manually installed packages can contain library versions not available in the standard repositories. This causes problems with dependency resolution when installing additional software from the official repository. Individual applications are less critical in this context, but when important system libraries in the third-party software are considered, complications are inevitable.

Depending on the severity of the complications, upgrades to the next version of the operating system might fail, or the system may become unbootable or generally unstable.

=== Mitigation ===
Users can reduce [[#Security Issues|security risks]] and eliminate [[#Dependency Hell|the risk of making the workstation unusable]] by using [[Multiple {{workstation_product_name_short}}|Multiple {{workstation_product_name}}]].
