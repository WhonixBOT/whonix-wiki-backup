== Introduction ==

Ricochet IM is is a portable, P2P, python chat application that is installed in {{project name}} by default. It is the new successor to the unmaintained TorChat. <ref>https://github.com/ricochet-im/ricochet/issues/30</ref> The Ricochet site describes how the application works: <ref>https://ricochet.im/</ref>

<blockquote>Ricochet uses the Tor network to reach your contacts without relying on messaging servers. It creates a hidden service, which is used to rendezvous with your contacts without revealing your location or IP address.

Instead of a username, you get a unique address that looks like ricochet:rs7ce36jsj24ogfw.
Other Ricochet users can use this address to send a contact request - asking to be added to your contacts list.

You can see when your contacts are online, and send them messages (and soon, files!). Your list of contacts is only known to your computer - never exposed to servers or network traffic monitoring.

Everything is encrypted end-to-end, so only the intended recipient can decrypt it, and anonymized, so nobody knows where it’s going and where it came from.</blockquote>

In summary, the benefits of Ricochet IM include:
* No saving of chat history.
* Reliance on Tor onion services for identity creation.
** Encryption and authentication properties therefore match Tor's strength.
* The server-less design means no metadata is ever collected.
* An OTF sponsored audit in early 2016 only identified a few minor problems (since fixed). <ref>https://ricochet.im/files/ricochet-ncc-audit-2016-01.pdf</ref> <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricochet_(software)</ref>

== {{project name}} Configuration ==

{{onion-grater-warning}}


Ricochet should be fully functional in {{project_name}}. If any problems are encountered, please leave comments on the [https://phabricator.whonix.org/T444 open Phabricator ticket].

=== Add a Ricochet Python Profile ===

In {{gateway_product_name}} (<code>sys-whonix</code>), onion-grater requires some adjustments.

{{Control_Port_Filter_Python_Profile_Add
|filename=/usr/share/onion-grater-merger/examples/40_ricochet.yml
|filename_new=/usr/share/doc/onion-grater-merger/examples/40_ricochet.yml
}}

=== Modify Firewall Settings ===

In {{workstation_product_name}} (<code>anon-whonix</code>), the firewall requires some adjustments.

{{Firewall Settings Workstation}}

Add.

{{CodeSelect|code=
EXTERNAL_OPEN_ALL=true
}}

Save.

{{Reload_Firewall_ws}}

== Start Ricochet ==

In {{workstation_product_name}} (<code>anon-whonix</code>), launch ricochet either through the start menu or from the command line.

{{CodeSelect|code=
ricochet
}}

== Backup/Restore Ricochet ID ==
Ricochet identities are ephemeral by design, meaning on program restart, a new identity will be generated and the last one with the added contacts will be lost. This is safer as long lived identities are easier to track over time. However one can preserve a certain username string and re-use it.

Backup <code>ricochet.json</code> in the config directory path below which contains the private key under <code>identity</code> in <code>serviceKey</code>. <ref>
https://github.com/ricochet-im/ricochet/issues/577
</ref>

You need to replace <code>/path/to/backup/location</code> with the actual location of your backup folder.

{{CodeSelect|code=
cp /home/user/.local/share/Ricochet/ricochet/ricochet.json /path/to/backup/location
}}

For now this is enough. Alternatively you could also backup the whole folder <code>/home/user/.local/share/Ricochet</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
cp -r /home/user/.local/share/Ricochet /path/to/backup/location
}}
