= Logo Contest Draft =
== Requirements ==
=== Graphical Requirements ===
* Source in SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) or EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) format.
* The image should convey the ideas behind Whonix: secrecy, privacy, anonymity, mystery, simplicity (Whonix is ready-to-use).

* An optional landscape graphical creation including the logo. <font size=-3>([https://www.whonix.org/w/images/e/e0/210-Banner.png old banner])</font> Size: xxx X xxx
* The "{{project_name_short}}" name must be spelled with an uppercase "W" only, and lowercase "honix".
* The image should be suited to print on nice stickers that people want to have on their computers, and on t-shirts that people are happy to wear.

=== Legal Requirements ===
* We cannot reuse the Tor, Debian or other logos for trademark/legal reasons.
* You'll surrender all rights of the image to Patrick Schleizer. The logo may be used for {{project name}} official branding/trademark.
* Make sure that the fonts that you use are compatible with XXX

== Complementary materials ==
As the logo will be used in quite different places, we encourage you to submit complementary materials. These are not strict requirements but will help us evaluate your proposal better. Besides, if your logo is chosen, we will need them anyway before we are able to put it to use publicly.

These complementary materials are:

* Fonts to be used to create other material matching the logo.
