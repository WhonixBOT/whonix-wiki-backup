Whonix 2020 Logo Contest
}}

Existing downloadable {{project name}} banners, logos and graphics be found [[Dev/Logo|here]]. 

= Logo Contest =

In 2020, {{project name}} will have provided advanced anonymity and security to users for more than eight years. To celebrate this milestone we are announcing a contest for designers to create a new, vibrant {{project name}} logo to give the platform a greater visual impact. 

The current {{project name}} [https://www.whonix.org/w/images/1/1d/Whonix_Profile_Light.svg logo] and [https://www.whonix.org/w/images/b/ba/Whonix-vectorized-logo.png banner] are now more than four years old and appear a little tired and dated.

== Requirements ==

=== Graphical Requirements ===

* The source must be in Scalable Vector Graphics (<code>SVG</code>) format.
* The image design should convey some of the concepts fundamental to {{project name}}: secrecy, privacy, anonymity, mystery and simplicity.
* The logo should have a <code>1:1</code> ratio. <font size=-3>([[Dev/Logo#Logo_2|old logo]].)</font> The size can be <code>500x500</code> or <code>1000x1000</code>.
* The landscape graphical creation should have a <code>3:1</code> ratio including the logo. <font size=-3>([[Dev/Logo#Banner_2|old banner]])</font> The size can be <code>1500x500</code> or <code>750x250</code>.
* The <code>{{project_name_short}}</code> name must be spelled with an uppercase "<code>W</code>" only, and lowercase "<code>honix</code>".
* The logo or banner should be suitable for printing. The intent is to produce attractive stickers that can be placed on computers as well as stylish t-shirts that people are proud to wear.
* Images should have no resemblance to occult symbols.

=== Legal Requirements ===

* The Tor, Debian or other related logos cannot be used for trademark/legal reasons.
* All images rights will be surrendered to the {{project name}} project ({{name}}) see {{legal}}.
* The logo may be used for {{project name}} official branding/trademark.
* Make sure the fonts in use are compatible with GPL3+.
* This is a voluntary contribution without any financial remuneration.
* All proposals can be discussed in public.
* Since a number of contributors might submit design ideas, there is no guarantee your design will be chosen.

== Complementary Materials ==

As the logo and banner will be used in various places, contributors are encouraged to submit complementary materials. This is not a strict requirement, but it assists in evaluating proposals. Further, if your logo is chosen, we will require these materials before the logo and banner are publicly used.

The complementary materials are:

* Necessary fonts to create other material matching the logo.

== Calendar ==

* Post in [https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-2020-logo-contest/9982 forum thread] or e-mail {{Name-email}}
** 31 December 2020: Deadline for sending proposals.
** 31 January 2021: The winner is announced.
