It is possible to run Virtual Machines inside Virtual Machines (VMs). That is called Nested Virtualization. <ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_virtualization</ref>

Be sure to change your host key. {{Code2|VirtualBox -> Preferences -> Input -> Host Key}}. The "outside" and the "inside" Host Key must differ, otherwise you can not leave the VM "inside" anymore.

Using ACPI <ref>{{Code|vboxmanage "Whonix-Workstation" modifyvm --acpi on}}</ref> and IOAPIC <ref>{{Code2|VirtualBox -> right click on VM -> Settings -> System -> uncheck "Enable IO APIC"}}</ref> <ref>{{Code|vboxmanage "Whonix-Workstation" modifyvm --ioapic on}}</ref> for all VM's, speeds up the "inside" VM a lot. These settings are in use for Whonix VMs by default.

VirtualBox does not support VT in VT yet. <ref>https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/4032</ref> So the "inside" VM might be slow depending on your host's performance. Inside the "inside" VM, disable VT. {{Code2|VirtualBox -> right click on VM -> Settings -> System -> Acceleration -> uncheck "Enable VT-x/AMD-V"}}
