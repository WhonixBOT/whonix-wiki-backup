For most active testers.

* [[Stay Tuned]]
* Check forum tag <code>testers-wanted</code>. https://forums.whonix.org/tag/testers-wanted
** If a {{project name}} release is still tagged <code>testers-wanted</code>, first check if there is already a corresponding {{project name}} stable release of that version. To find out, [[Stay Tuned]]. If there is already a release of that version, then no extra testing is required anymore. That would mean that removal of the <code>testers-wanted</code> forum tag has been forgotten.
