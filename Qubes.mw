= Overview =
[[File:qubes-logo-blue.png|20px]][[File:Whonix_old_logo.png|20px]]'''Qubes-Whonix''' is the seamless combination of [[File:qubes-logo-blue.png|20px]] [https://www.qubes-os.org Qubes OS] and [[File:Whonix_old_logo.png|20px]] [https://www.whonix.org Whonix] for advanced security and anonymity.

In this configuration Whonix runs on top of Qubes inside virtual machines (VMs), just like any other OS on the same platform (Fedora, Debian, Arch Linux and so on).

The Qubes bare-metal hypervisor is based on [https://www.xenproject.org Xen] and [https://getfedora.org Fedora]. Via  hardware support like VT-x, VT-d and TXT, Qubes has implemented a strict security-by-isolation architecture. Hardware controllers and multiple user domains (qubes) are isolated using separate VMs that are explicitly assigned different levels of trust, yet the desktop experience is user-friendly and well-integrated.

Whonix is based on [https://www.debian.org Debian] and [https://www.torproject.org Tor]. The design provides a two-VM, split security architecture: an isolated Whonix-Gateway (ProxyVM; <code>sys-whonix</code>) for complete routing of traffic over Tor; and Whonix-Workstation (AppVM; <code>anon-whonix</code>) for all desktop applications, which serves as a tailored OS environment for Tor-based privacy/anonymity.

To use Qubes-Whonix, Qubes must first be installed as a hypervisor on the physical host computer, followed by installation of the two separate Whonix TemplateVMs -- <code>{{whonix-gw}}</code> and <code>{{whonix-ws}}</code> -- on top of Qubes. From this point, the Whonix TemplateVMs can be used for customization and creation of multiple Whonix-Gateway ProxyVMs and Whonix-Workstation AppVMs, enabling enhanced compartmentalization of user activities for better privacy. <ref>The only limitation on the number of possible VMs is available disk space.</ref>
