|description=Using Whonix with Qubes OS
}}

'''Testers only!'''

= General =

This page provides primary information and instructions for running Whonix on the Qubes virtualization platform for the goal of torifying your internet traffic inside of the highly secure VM isolation framework that Qubes provides.

Learn more about Qubes at: https://qubes-os.org

For support or development issues specific to Qubes + Whonix, we have the dedicated Whonix Qubes forum at:

* https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/board,16.0.html


Qubes + Whonix currently exists as a customized dual HVM (HardwareVM) configuration:

<pre>Whonix-Gateway HVM + Whonix-Workstation HVM</pre>

A simple networking setup for Qubes + Whonix would look like:

<pre>NetVM <- FirewallVM <- Whonix-Gateway <- Whonix-Workstation</pre>

Where, for example, the Whonix-Gateway conceptually replaces TorVM as your Tor ProxyVM, and Whonix-Workstation conceptually replaces your standard AppVMs (AnonVMs).

We hope to provide a native ProxyVM + AppVM support, once the Qubes Debian Template gets ProxyVM capability added.

We could use your help. Please feel free to join in with improving the Qubes + Whonix platform!



= Starting Whonix HVMs =

Unfortunately Qubes doesn't presently seem to allow you to set a custom config file as the default.

This means you have to ALWAYS startup the Whonix HVMs in the dom0 terminal, using the (qvm-start --custom-config=) command.

These sample Whonix startup commands will work if your variable names match those in the Install Guides.

* For Whonix-Gateway:
** <pre>qvm-start --custom-config=/var/lib/qubes/appvms/whonix-gateway/custom.conf whonix-gateway</pre>

* For Whonix-Workstation:
** <pre>qvm-start --custom-config=/var/lib/qubes/appvms/whonix-workstation/custom.conf whonix-workstation</pre>

* Otherwise you can adjust this Whonix startup command to your own custom setup:
** <pre>qvm-start --custom-config=<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE> <WHONIX_HVM_NAME></pre>



= Whonix vs. TorVM =

The Qubes project provides TorVM for routing VM traffic through Tor.

Running Whonix within Qubes provides an alternative to TorVM and similarly routes VM traffic through Tor.

The Whonix-Gateway serves as an alternative replacement to TorVM, while the Whonix-Workstation acts as an alternative replacement to AppVMs (AnonVMs) when using Whonix within Qubes.

There has been prior discussions and information shared in the Whonix & Qubes communities about the comparative differences and pros vs. cons between Whonix & TorVM.

Here are some sources of relevant discussion and information on Whonix vs. TorVM:

* https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Comparison_with_Others

* https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Features

* https://wiki.qubes-os.org/wiki/UserDoc/TorVM

* https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/38/what-threat-model-is-qubes-os-torvm-most-appropriate-for


We welcome further discussion and curation on the pros & cons of using Whonix vs. TorVM in Qubes, so that users may better understand which alternative is the right choice for them.

We have opened a dedicated thread for further discussion on Whonix vs. TorVM in our Qubes forum. Feel free to join in here:

* https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,479.0.html



= Known Issues =

These are known issues that are currently unresolved. Please feel free to report any additional issues specific to running Whonix on top of Qubes in the [https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/board,16.0.html Whonix Qubes Forum]. Please also feel free to help us resolve these known issues in the Qubes + Whonix platform.



* ''' No TransPort Internet Access [BUG]:'''
** Currently the Tor TransPort transparent proxy is not working in Qubes, which means that applications other than Whonix default apps will not have internet access by default. However, Whonix default apps, such as Tor Browser, will have internet access since they come pre-configured to route through SocksPort instead of TransPort.
** https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,524.0.html

= Install Guides =

Additional install guides will be provided as new Qubes + Whonix configurations are developed.

The following install guides are currently compatible with Whonix 9. If wanting to use a different Whonix version, it may take some modifications.



== Install in Qubes HVM with Whonix Binary Images ==

This approach uses the Whonix qcow2 binary image downloads to import the Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation into Qubes HVMs.



=== Provide Whonix Raw Images to Qubes dom0 ===

There are several differing methods and security philosophies for completing this section of steps, so if you prefer a different approach of acquiring, extracting, converting, or transferring the Whonix raw-formatted images to dom0, then please feel free to do so.



'''1. Create a Temporary AppVM (whonix-images) for Processing Whonix Images:'''

* In dom0: Qubes VM Manager: Create New VM
** Choose Settings:
*** Name and label: whonix-images
*** Use this template: fedora-20-x64 (default)
*** Type: AppVM
** Press: OK



'''2. Expand Private Disk Image of whonix-images:'''

* In dom0: Terminal:
** <pre>qvm-grow-private whonix-images 15G</pre>

* In whonix-images: Terminal:
** <pre>sudo resize2fs /dev/xvdb</pre>



'''3. Download and Transfer Whonix qcow2 Images to whonix-images:'''

Depending upon your workflow and security preferences, you can:


* Download Whonix directly within whonix-images:
** For Whonix-Gateway:
*** Whonix-Gateway 9 qcow2 Image: http://mirror.whonix.de/9/Whonix-Gateway-9.libvirt.xz
*** Whonix-Gateway 9 qcow2 Signature: http://mirror.whonix.de/9/Whonix-Gateway-9.libvirt.xz.asc
*** Whonix-Gateway 9 qcow2 Signing Key: https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Whonix_Signing_Key
** For Whonix-Workstation:
*** Whonix-Workstation 9 qcow2 Image: http://mirror.whonix.de/9/Whonix-Workstation-9.libvirt.xz
*** Whonix-Workstation 9 qcow2 Signature: http://mirror.whonix.de/9/Whonix-Workstation-9.libvirt.xz.asc
*** Whonix-Workstation 9 qcow2 Signing Key: https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Whonix_Signing_Key


* Download Whonix elsewhere and transfer into whonix-images:
** Qubes File Copy Between VMs:
*** https://qubes-os.org/wiki/CopyingFiles
** Qubes USB Storage Mounting:
*** https://qubes-os.org/wiki/StickMounting


Important: Please check file verification signatures of Whonix downloads before using them!

Whonix Verification Instructions: https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Download#Verify_the_Whonix_images

=== Whonix First Run ===

Notice that presently in Qubes you must ALWAYS start VMs from the dom0 terminal when using a custom config (qvm-start --custom-config=).

During first boot, Whonix will go through the "Whonix First Run Initializer" and then shut down.

After first boot, you will need to restart the VMs with the following startup commands.
