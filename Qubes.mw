__NOTOC__

'''Qubes-Whonix''' is the seamless combination of [https://www.qubes-os.org Qubes OS] and [https://www.whonix.org Whonix] for Security + Anonymity.

Whonix runs on top of Qubes as a VM (virtual machine), just like any other typical OS does in Qubes.

Qubes is based on [http://www.xenproject.org Xen] and [https://getfedora.org Fedora], and through hardware support (VT-x, VT-d, TXT) Qubes provides a security-by-isolation architecture, while also offering a single integrated user-friendly desktop experience across VMs.

Whonix is based on [https://www.debian.org Debian] and [https://www.torproject.org Tor], and provides a TwoVM split security architecture with isolated Whonix-Gateway (ProxyVM) for total Tor traffic routing and Whonix-Workstation (AppVM) for user desktop applications, which serves as a tailored OS environment for Tor-based privacy/anonymity.

With Qubes-Whonix, you install Qubes as a hypervisor onto your physical host computer, and then install Whonix as two separate TemplateVMs on top of Qubes.

From here, you are able to use the Whonix TemplateVMs to customize and create as many Whonix-Gateway ProxyVMs and Whonix-Workstation AppVMs as you'd like, for optimal privacy-enhanced compartmentalization of your digital life.

While Qubes-Whonix is presently believed to be one of the absolute strongest options for security and anonymity, it is NOT bulletproof and suffers from some of the same flaws that all other such systems possess. Do NOT assume that your security or anonymity is guaranteed.
