__NOTOC__

<!--T:2-->
'''Qubes-Whonix''' is the seamless combination of [[File:qubes-logo-blue.png|20px]] [https://www.qubes-os.org Qubes OS] and [https://www.whonix.org Whonix] for Security + Anonymity.

<!--T:3-->
Whonix runs on top of Qubes as a VM (virtual machine), just like any other typical OS does in Qubes.

<!--T:4-->
Qubes is based on [http://www.xenproject.org Xen] and [https://getfedora.org Fedora], and through hardware support (VT-x, VT-d, TXT) Qubes provides a security-by-isolation architecture, while also offering a single integrated user-friendly desktop experience across VMs.

<!--T:5-->
Whonix is based on [https://www.debian.org Debian] and [https://www.torproject.org Tor], and provides a TwoVM split security architecture with isolated Whonix-Gateway (ProxyVM) for total Tor traffic routing and Whonix-Workstation (AppVM) for user desktop applications, which serves as a tailored OS environment for Tor-based privacy/anonymity.

<!--T:6-->
With Qubes-Whonix, you install Qubes as a hypervisor onto your physical host computer, and then install Whonix as two separate TemplateVMs on top of Qubes.

<!--T:7-->
From here, you are able to use the Whonix TemplateVMs to customize and create as many Whonix-Gateway ProxyVMs and Whonix-Workstation AppVMs as you'd like, for optimal privacy-enhanced compartmentalization of your digital life.
