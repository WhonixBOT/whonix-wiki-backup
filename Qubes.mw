= Overview =
[[File:qubes-logo-blue.png|20px]][[File:{{project_name_short}}_old_logo.png|20px]]'''{{q_project_name}}''' is the seamless combination of [[File:qubes-logo-blue.png|20px]] [https://www.qubes-os.org Qubes OS] and [[File:{{project_name_short}}_old_logo.png|20px]] [https://www.whonix.org {{project_name}}] for advanced security and anonymity.

In this configuration {{project name}} runs on top of Qubes inside virtual machines (VMs), just like any other OS on the same platform (Fedora, Debian, Arch Linux and so on).

The Qubes bare-metal hypervisor is based on [https://www.xenproject.org Xen] and [https://getfedora.org Fedora]. Via  hardware support like [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization#Intel_virtualization_(VT-x) VT-x] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization#I/O_MMU_virtualization_(AMD-Vi_and_Intel_VT-d) VT-d] Qubes has successfully implemented a comprehensive yet strict security-by-isolation architecture. Hardware controllers and multiple user domains (qubes) are isolated using separate VMs that are explicitly assigned different levels of trust, yet the desktop experience is user-friendly and well-integrated.

{{project_name}} is based on [https://www.debian.org Debian] and [https://www.torproject.org Tor]. The design provides a two-VM, split security architecture: an isolated {{gateway_product_name}} (ProxyVM; <code>{{gateway_product_name_vm}}</code>) for complete routing of traffic over Tor; and {{workstation_product_name}} (App Qube; <code>anon-whonix</code>) for all desktop applications, which serves as a tailored OS environment for Tor-based privacy/anonymity.

To use [[Qubes|{{q_project_name}}]], Qubes must first be installed as a hypervisor on the physical host computer, followed by installation of the two separate {{project name}} TemplateVMs -- <code>{{whonix-gw}}</code> and <code>{{whonix-ws}}</code> -- on top of Qubes. From this point, the {{project name}} TemplateVMs can be used for customization and creation of multiple {{gateway_product_name}} ProxyVMs and {{workstation_product_name}} AppVMs, enabling enhanced compartmentalization of user activities for better privacy. <ref>The only limitation on the number of possible VMs is available disk space.</ref>
