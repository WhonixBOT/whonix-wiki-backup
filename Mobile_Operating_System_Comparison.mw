* Supports DRM ([https://www.defectivebydesign.org/ <u>D</u>igital <u>R</u>estrictions <u>M</u>anagement]) / walled garden / anti-freedom / Google SafetyNet where developers can configure their applications to only run on devices on certified firmware. <ref>
* Quote https://grapheneos.org/usage#sandboxed-play-services <blockquote>The hardware attestation feature is part of the Android Open Source Project and is fully supported by GrapheneOS. SafetyNet attestation chooses to use it to enforce using Google certified operating systems. However, app developers can use it directly and permit other properly signed operating systems upholding the security model. GrapheneOS has [https://grapheneos.org/articles/attestation-compatibility-guide a detailed guide] for app developers on how to support GrapheneOS with the hardware attestation API. Direct use of the hardware attestation API provides much higher assurance than using SafetyNet so these apps have nothing to lose by using a more meaningful API and supporting a more secure OS.</blockquote>

** More and more businesses communicate over proprietary messengers such as WhatsApp and WhatsApp cannot be used on rooted devices or with custom ROMs. <ref>

** More and more government services require the same. For example, an Android or iPhone with Google maps location history enabled and Skype is mandatory for entering Japan. <ref>

** Three are still 2 billion unbanked people. <ref>

</ref> People who do not even have access to the most basic financial services such as a bank account. For unbanked people it would be unreasonable and should not be expected of them to refuse their first chance to use a mobile banking app with such restrictions.
** In conclusion, the recommendation to simply not use such applications is impractical and counter the lived reality of many people.
** Potential [[Miscellaneous_Threats_to_User_Freedom#Conflict_of_Interest|Conflict of Interest]]. If GrapheneOS wouldn't disable easy to use technical ways that most laymen users can use to gain root and/or to keep control over the software running on their devices, then GrapheneOS's chances to be ever get a highly profitable hardware producer partnership would be severely diminished.
