Users sometimes ask how they can reset their system -- this is called <code>factory reset</code>. <ref>
In the {{project name}} case it is not really a <code>factory reset</code> because at the time of writing the platform is software-only and not hardware-related. Therefore, strictly speaking no factory defaults exist. However, <code>vendor settings reset</code> is harder for users to understand and <code>factory reset</code> has a nicer sound to it.
</ref> Two major methods exist.

* '''<u>Re-install method</u>:''' Delete {{project name}} -- or just delete VMs intended for factory reset -- and re-install the most recent (stable) version of {{project name}}. This is a "cleaner" and more comprehensive method which will return the system to near vendor defaults. However, this option is less convenient as important user data must first be migrated (if applicable). <ref>

* '''<u>Reset settings method</u>:''' This will reset settings to vendor defaults as much as possible. This method is imperfect and cannot undo all user modifications or solve all issues.
