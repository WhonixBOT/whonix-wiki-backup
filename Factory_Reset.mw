{{project name}} Factory Reset
}}

{{stub}}

Users sometimes ask how they can reset their system. This is called <code>factory reset</code>. <ref>
In case of {{project name}} it's not really a <code>factory reset</code> because at time of writing {{project name}} is only software and not hardware. Therefore there cannot really be any factory defaults by the strict word definition. Calling it <code>vendor settings reset</code> is harder to understand. <code>factory reset</code> has a nicer sound to it.

Two major methods exist.

<u>'''A)'''</u>: <u>re-install method</u>

Delete {{project name}} (or delete just 1 VM) and re-install the most recent (stable) version of {{project name}}. This is the "cleaner", all covering method and moves the system as close to vendor default as possible. However, this option is less convenient as user data would have to be migrated in case that matters.

<u>'''B)'''</u>: <u>reset settings method</u>

Reset settings to vendor defaults as much as possible.
