= Introduction =

Since all {{project_name}} releases are signed with the same key, it is unnecessary to verify the key every time a new release is announced. Trust in the key might gradually increase over time, but cryptographic signatures must still be verified every time a new release is downloaded. 

This page is strongly related to the [[Trust|Placing Trust in {{project_name}}]] page.

<!--
EDITORS NOTES:
- Not recommending 'scurl': Because these instructions are done on the host. Perhaps by users that are not yet {{project_name}} users. 'scurl' is not available to them.
- Not recommending curl: Because it may not be installed on their host. Perhaps Windows users are looking at these instructions.
- Instructions target regular users. Not from-source-builders.

'''4.''' Verify the output.

The output should be identical to the following.

'''5.''' Import the key.

{{CodeSelect|code=

The output should confirm the key was imported.

gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
</pre>

''If the {{project_name}} signing key was already imported in the past'', the output should confirm the key is unchanged.

<pre>
gpg: key 8D66066A2EEACCDA: "Patrick Schleizer <adrelanos@riseup.net>" not changed
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:              unchanged: 1
</pre>

If the following message appears at the end of the output.

<pre>
gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found
</pre>

Analyze the other messages as usual. This extra message does not relate to the {{project_name}} signing key itself, but instead usually means the user has not created an OpenPGP key yet, which is of no importance when verifying virtual machine images.

'''6.''' Advanced users can check [[#Web of Trust|Web of Trust]] further below for better security.

== OpenPGP Web of Trust ==
A few people have signed [[Patrick Schleizer]]'s (adrelanos') OpenPGP key in [[OpenPGP#The_OpenPGP_Web_of_Trust|The OpenPGP Web of Trust]].

Jan Dittberner <ref>http://www.dittberner.info/de/content/jan-dittberner</ref> ({{Code2|Debian Developer}}) <ref>https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=Jan+Dittberner</ref> signed Patrick's key. So did intrigeri (Tails developer, {{Code2|Debian Developer}}); Peter Palfrader ({{Code2|Debian Developer}}); Richard King; and Michael Carbone (accessnow.org).

Users relying on Debian or one of the many Debian derivatives (like Ubuntu) already trust apt-get, the APT repository of the relevant distribution. This means the Debian keyring can be installed as a trusted source for obtaining Jan's, intrigeri's or Peter's key, to check their signature on Patrick's key.
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' [[Update]] the package lists.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}

'''2.''' Install the Debian keyring.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install debian-keyring
}}

'''3.''' Extract a signer's key from the Debian keyring and import it into your own keyring. 

Here is an example using Jan's key.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/debian-keyring.gpg --armor --export B2FF1D95CE8F7A22DF4CF09BA73E0055558FB8DD {{!}} gpg --import
}}

'''4.''' ''Optional:'' Try to establish a better trust path to the signer by checking signatures on the signer's key.

Check signatures on Patrick's key.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --check-sigs 916B8D99C38EAF5E8ADC7A2A8D66066A2EEACCDA
}}

The output of the above command should show signatures on Patrick's key, which should include the signer's signature.
