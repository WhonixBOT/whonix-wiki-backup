__TOC__

-----

= Increased Threat of Identity Correlation =
By design, a VPN routes all your applications - those without any proxy settings - through the VPN. You may not want this, as explained below. To circumvent that, you should use this {{workstation_product_name}} only for the particular application you want to route through the tunnel-link. You are advised to use [[Multiple {{workstation_product_name_short}}|Multiple {{workstation_product_name}}]].

= Prevent Bypassing of the Tunnel-Link =
{{Prevent_Bypassing_the_Tunnel-Link}}

{{Anchor|Fail_Closed_Mechanism}}
= Use a Fail Closed Mechanism =
{{Fail_Closed_Mechanism}}

Instructions below include a fail closed mechanism.

-----

= VPN Client Choice =
Use OpenVPN.

Using bitmask for this use case is not possible. In other words, you cannot use <code>user &rarr; Tor &rarr; bitmask &rarr; Internet</code>. <ref>
https://github.com/leapcode/bitmask_client/issues/1009
</ref>

Other VPN clients are [[unsupported]]. We are not aware of any sane VPN client choices besides OpenVPN.

-----

= Setup Tor before a VPN (User &rarr; Tor &rarr; VPN &rarr; Internet) =
== Introduction ==
Two methods. 

* [[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]] users have the option to use a [[#Separate VPN-Gateway]] but could also use [[#Inside {{workstation_product_name}}]].
* [[{{non q project name short}}|{{non q project name}}]] users should prefer [[#Inside {{workstation_product_name}}]].

-----

== Separate VPN-Gateway ==
A separate VPN-Gateway between {{gateway_product_name}} and {{workstation_product_name}}, i.e. {{workstation_product_name}} &rarr; VPN-Gateway &rarr; {{gateway_product_name}}.
 
[[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]] only! [[{{non q project name short}}|{{non q project name}}]] is [[unsupported]]!

User &rarr; Tor &rarr; VPN &rarr; Internet
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Clone a TemplateVM for example, debian-9 and name the new template clone debian-9-vpn.<ref>At the time of writing Debian 9 stretch was the stable release version.</ref>

<code>Qube Manager</code> &rarr; <code>debian-9</code> &rarr; <code><u>C</u>lone qube</code> &rarr; <i><code>Enter name for Qube clone:</i> debian-9-vpn</code> &rarr; <code>Press: OK</code>

'''2.''' Create a new ProxyVM based on the newly cloned template. Name the VM VPN-Gateway and set the {{gateway_product_name}} TemplateBasedProxyVM (commonly called <code>sys-whonix</code>) as NetVM. Make sure to check [✔] the box for provides_network.

{{Box|text=
<code>Qube Manager</code> &rarr; <code><u>Q</u>ube</code> &rarr; <code>Create <u>n</u>ew qube</code>

* Name and label: <code>VPN-Gateway</code> (Set any color)
* Type: <code>AppVM</code>
* Template: <code>debian-9-vpn</code>
* Networking: <code>sys-whonix</code>
* Advanced:   [<code>✔</code>] Provides network 
* Press: <code>OK</code>
}}

'''3.''' Set up the VPN-Gateway as per [https://qubes-os.org/doc/vpn/ Qubes VPN Documentation]. The instructions to configure the [https://qubes-os.org/doc/vpn/#set-up-a-proxyvm-as-a-vpn-gateway-using-iptables-and-cli-scripts VPN gateway using iptables and CLI scripts] is preferred to prevent clearnet leaks when the VPN breaks down. 

{{Box|text=
Without configuring a fail closed configuration when the VPN connection breaks down, all traffic originating from the {{workstation_product_name}} AppVM (commonly called <code>anon-whonix</code>) would <u>only</u> be forced through Tor.

'''User &rarr; Tor &rarr; Internet''' 
}}

{{Box|text=
<u>Note:</u> UDP-style VPN connections are incompatible with Tor which requires that the VPN to be configured to use TCP.<ref>[[Tor#UDP]]</ref> To do that, add <code>proto tcp</code> to the VPN configuration file /rw/config/vpn/openvpn-client.ovpn. Most, but not all VPN providers support this configuration. 
}}

'''4'''. Check, that your VPN-Gateway is fully functional. Test connectivity from inside the VPN-Gateway as per: [https://qubes-os.org/doc/vpn/ Qubes VPN Documentation]

'''5'''. (Recommended) In {{workstation_product_name}} (commonly called <code>anon-whonix</code>) apply instructions from the above chapter: [[#Prevent Bypassing of the Tunnel-Link]]. 
}}

When using a separate VPN Gateway no DNS configuration is required. System DNS should work out of the box.<ref> Because a properly configured Qubes VPN-Gateway will be able to resolve DNS.</ref>

If using [[Tor Browser]] the following warning will be shown:

<i><pre>
Something Went Wrong!
Tor is not working in this browser.
</pre></i>

This is expected. For technical background, see footnote.<ref>
This is because Tor Browser can no longer access Tor's ControlPort ([[Dev/CPFP|onion-grater]]) on {{gateway_product_name}}.
</ref>

For troubleshooting, see footnote.
<ref>
* Check, that your VPN-Gateway is fully functional. Test connectivity from inside the VPN-Gateway.
* When testing the VPN connection '''Do Not!''' add any VMs that have been previoiulsy used for non-anonymous activities behind your VPN-Gateway. This will burn the VPN making it unsuitable for use with Whonix! 
* If users wish to use a non-{{project_name}} VM behind the VPN-Gateway for testing, a freshly created VM should be created for this purpose. 
</ref>

Done! It is recommended to run the related [[Tunnels/Connecting_to_Tor_before_a_VPN#Leak_Tests| #Leak Tests]].

=== How to Submit a Support Request ===
{{VPN/Setup/Support Requests}}

-----
= Leak Tests =
== Introduction ==
We want to verify, that the traffic always goes {{Code2|User &rarr; Tor &rarr; VPN &rarr; Internet}} and not only {{Code2|User &rarr; Tor &rarr; Internet}}. Therefore you should run the following related leak tests inside {{workstation_product_name}}. Test Tor Browser, a uwt wrapper deactivated application as well as a regular application for leaks.

== regular application test ==
Same test as above, but use curl without pre-configured [[Stream Isolation|stream isolation]].

<!-- EDITORS NOTE: '{{!}}' is a magic word for '|'.-->
{{CodeSelect|code=
{{Curl_Plain}} --silent {{Curl Secure}} https://check.torproject.org {{!}} grep IP
}}

<ref name=nodns>
In case you have no functional system DNS, you could also alternatively just test TCP.

The IP {{Code2|{{Check.torproject.org_IP}}}} might change. You can find out the current one by running the following command inside a VM that has functional system DNS. (Ideally inside a {{workstation_product_name}}.)

{{CodeSelect|code=
nslookup check.torproject.org
}}
</ref> <ref>

<!-- EDITORS NOTE: '{{!}}' is a magic word for '|'.-->
{{CodeSelect|code=
{{Curl_Plain}} --silent {{Curl Secure}} -H 'Host: check.torproject.org' -k https://{{Check.torproject.org IP}} {{!}} grep IP
}}
</ref>

Should show something along the lines: {{Code2|Your IP address appears to be: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx}}<br />
Should show the IP of your VPN.

== uwt wrapped application test ==
Connect to check.torproject.org.

<!-- EDITORS NOTE: '{{!}}' is a magic word for '|'.-->
{{CodeSelect|code=
curl --silent {{Curl Secure}} https://check.torproject.org {{!}} grep IP
}}

<ref name=nodns /> <ref>
<!-- EDITORS NOTE: '{{!}}' is a magic word for '|'.-->
{{CodeSelect|code=
curl --silent {{Curl Secure}} -H 'Host: check.torproject.org' -k https://{{Check.torproject.org IP}} {{!}} grep IP
}}
</ref>

== Browser IP Test ==
You can skip this test if you do not care about using Tor Browser through the VPN.

If you did correctly configure everything, test your setup. Open https://check.torproject.org in Tor Browser. It will tell you then "{{Code2|You are not using Tor.}}" and you'll see your VPN's IP. In fact your VPN was tunneled through Tor first. (Because {{workstation_product_name}} can not make any non-Tor connections by design, everything is tunneled over Tor.)

== DNS Leak Test ==
{{DNS Leak Tests Online}}

== Other Leak Tests ==
If you are feeling awesome, you could also run more general leak tests that are not related to tunneling. However, these are more difficult to do and target developers rather than users. If you are interested, see [[Dev/Leak_Tests|leak tests]].
