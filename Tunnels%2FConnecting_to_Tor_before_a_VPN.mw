'''User -> Tor -> VPN -> Internet'''

= Increased Threat of Identity Correlation =
By design, a VPN routes all your applications - those without any proxy settings - through the VPN. You may not want this, as explained below. To circumvent that, you should use this Whonix-Workstation only for the particular application you want to route through the tunnel-link. You are advised to use [[Multiple Whonix-Workstations]].

= Prevent Bypassing the Tunnel-Link =
{{Prevent_Bypassing_the_Tunnel-Link}}

= Setup Tor before a VPN (User -> Tor -> VPN -> Internet) =
Connect to your VPN using your preferred software *inside* the (Whonix-)Workstation. Note that UDP-style VPN connections will not work with Tor. Therefore, use TCP. For examples, see [[Tunnels/Examples]].

= Use a Fail Closed Mechanism =
{{Fail_Closed_Mechanism}}

If you want to enforce, that the VPN always gets used, try [https://github.com/adrelanos/VPN-Firewall VPN-Firewall].

= Leak Tests =
== Introduction ==
We want to verify, that the traffic always goes {{Code2|User -> Tor -> VPN -> Internet}} and not only {{Code2|User -> Tor -> Internet}}. Therefore we should test the Tor Browser, a uwt wrapper deactivated application as well as a regular application.

== Browser IP Test ==
You can skip this test if you do not care about using Tor Browser through the VPN.

If you did correctly configure everything, test your setup. Open https://check.torproject.org in Tor Browser. It will tell you then "{{Code2|You are not using Tor.}}" and you'll see your VPN's IP. In fact your VPN was tunneled through Tor first. (Because Whonix-Workstation can not make any non-Tor connections by design, everything is tunneled over Tor.)

== uwt wrapped application test ==
Connect to check.tpo.

<!-- Cannot use CodeSelect becuase it does not like the pipe |. -->
<pre>
curl --silent --tlsv1 --proto =https -H 'Host: check.torproject.org' -k https://38.229.72.22 | grep IP
</pre>

Should show something along the lines: {{Code2|Your IP address appears to be: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx}}<br />
Should show the IP of your VPN.

== regular application test ==
Same test as above, but use {{Code2|curl.anondist-orig}} <ref>Real {{Code2|curl}} binary.</ref> rather than {{Code2|curl}} <ref>{{Code2|uwt}} wrapped version of {{Code2|curl}}.</ref>.

<!-- Cannot use CodeSelect becuase it does not like the pipe |. -->
<pre>
curl.anondist-orig --silent --tlsv1 --proto =https -H 'Host: check.torproject.org' -k https://38.229.72.22 | grep IP
</pre>
