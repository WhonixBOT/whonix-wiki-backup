'''User -> Tor -> VPN -> Internet'''

= Increased Threat of Identity Correlation =
By design, a VPN routes all your applications - those without any proxy settings - through the VPN. You may not want this, as explained below. To circumvent that, you should use this Whonix-Workstation only for the particular application you want to route through the tunnel-link. You are advised to use [[Multiple Whonix-Workstations]].

= Prevent Bypassing the Tunnel-Link =
== Introduction ==
{{mbox

| text       = You need the read and apply the following, otherwise this would lead to unexpected results. Namely, your traffic for certain applications only going through Tor, but not through the tunnel-link.
}}

In essence, you do this by disabling stream isolation.

By Whonix default, a lot pre-installed applications are configured for [[Stream Isolation]]. These applications are by default configured to use Tor SocksPorts, instead of Tor's TransPort.

All applications, which are configured to use Tor SocksPort's, will not be tunneled through the VPN. They will be "only" tunneled through Tor. This is because, the VPN will not touch local connections to {{Code2|10.152.152.10}}, which is the Whonix-Gateway. For example, if you wish to tunnel Tor Browser the route User -> Tor -> VPN -> Internet, you have to remove all proxy settings from [[Tor Browser]], see below.

== deactivate uwt wrappers  ==
To deactivate all uwt wrappers permanently, see below. (Otherwise, if you want more fine granulated control of uwt wrapper deactivation, see [[Stream_Isolation#Deactivate_uwt_Stream_Isolation_Wrapper]].)

{{Tor_Browser_Change_or_Remove_Proxy_Settings}}

== Deactivate Misc Proxy Settings ==
{{Deactivate_Misc_Proxy_Settings}}

= Setup Tor before a VPN (User -> Tor -> VPN -> Internet) =
Connect to your VPN using your preferred software *inside* the (Whonix-)Workstation. Note that UDP-style VPN connections will not work with Tor. Therefore, use TCP. For examples, see [[Tunnels/Examples]].

= Use a Fail Closed Mechanism =
{{Fail_Closed_Mechanism}}

If you want to enforce, that the VPN always gets used, try [https://github.com/adrelanos/VPN-Firewall VPN-Firewall].

= Leak Tests =
== Introduction ==
We want to verify, that the traffic always goes {{Code2|User -> Tor -> VPN -> Internet}} and not only {{Code2|User -> Tor -> Internet}}. Therefore we should the Tor Browser, a uwt wrapper deactivated application as well as a regular application.

== Browser IP Test ==
You can skip this test if you do not care about using Tor Browser through the VPN.

If you did correctly configure everything, test your setup. Open https://check.torproject.org in Tor Browser. It will tell you then "{{Code2|You are not using Tor.}}" and you'll see your VPN's IP. In fact your VPN was tunneled through Tor first. (Because Whonix-Workstation can not make any non-Tor connections by design, everything is tunneled over Tor.)

== uwt wrapped application test ==
Connect to check.tpo.

<!-- Cannot use CodeSelect becuase it does not like the pipe |. -->
<pre>
curl --silent --tlsv1 --proto =https -H 'Host: check.torproject.org' -k https://38.229.72.22 | grep IP
</pre>

Should show something along the lines: {{Code2|Your IP address appears to be: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx}}<br />
Should show the IP of your VPN.

== regular application test ==
Same test as above, but use {{Code2|curl.anondist-orig}} <ref>Real {{Code2|curl}} binary.</ref> rather than {{Code2|curl}} <ref>{{Code2|uwt}} wrapped version of {{Code2|curl}}.</ref>.

<!-- Cannot use CodeSelect becuase it does not like the pipe |. -->
<pre>
curl.anondist-orig --silent --tlsv1 --proto =https -H 'Host: check.torproject.org' -k https://38.229.72.22 | grep IP
</pre>
