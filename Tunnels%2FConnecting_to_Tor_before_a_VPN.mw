'''User -> Tor -> VPN -> Internet'''

==== Important things to consider when connecting to Tor before a VPN ====
'''Loss of stream isolation'''

While you are connecting to Tor before a VPN, you probably will not be able to make use of the browser tab stream isolation feature of Tor Browser. <ref>[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3455 Bug #3455: Tor Browser should set SOCKS username for a request based on referer]</ref> This is because Tor Browser would not talk to Tor directly anymore. Tor Browser would connect to the VPN instead.

'''Possible increased threat of identity correlation'''

By design, a VPN routes all your applications - those without any proxy settings - through the VPN. You may not want this, as explained below. To circumvent that, you should use this Whonix-Workstation only for the particular application you want to route through the VPN. You are advised to read [[Multiple Whonix-Workstations]].

=== Setup Tor before a VPN (User -> Tor -> VPN -> Internet) ===

Connect to your VPN using your preferred software *inside* the (Whonix-)Workstation. Note that UDP-style VPN connections will not work with Tor. Therefore, use TCP. For examples, see [[Tunnels/Examples]].

=== Using TransPort instead of SocksPort is required for User -> Tor -> VPN -> Internet ===
For applications configured to use Tor's SocksPort, instead of Tor's TransPort, which is the default setting for most Whonix default applications, such as [[Tor Browser]].

Rather, all applications, which are configured to use Tor SocksPort's, will not be tunneled through the VPN. They will be "only" tunneled through Tor. This is because, the VPN will not touch connections to {{Code2|10.152.152.10}}, which is the Whonix-Gateway. For example, if you wish to tunnel Tor Browser the route User -> Tor -> VPN -> Internet, you have to remove all proxy settings from Tor Browser, see [[Tor_Browser#Remove_Proxy_Settings|Remove Proxy Settings]]. Check.torproject.org will tell you then "{{Code2|You are not using Tor.}}" and you'll see your VPN's IP. In fact your VPN was tunneled through Tor first. (Because Whonix-Workstation can not make any non-Tor connections by design, everything is tunneled over Tor.)

=== Use a Fail Closed Mechanism ===
