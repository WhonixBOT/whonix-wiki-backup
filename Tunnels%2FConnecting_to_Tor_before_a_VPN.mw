'''<code>User</code> -> <code>Tor</code> -> <code>VPN</code> -> <code>Internet</code>'''

__TOC__

-----

= Increased Threat of Identity Correlation =
By design, a VPN routes all your applications - those without any proxy settings - through the VPN. You may not want this, as explained below. To circumvent that, you should use this Whonix-Workstation only for the particular application you want to route through the tunnel-link. You are advised to use [[Multiple Whonix-Workstations]].

= Prevent Bypassing of the Tunnel-Link =
{{Prevent_Bypassing_the_Tunnel-Link}}

{{Anchor|Fail_Closed_Mechanism}}
= Use a Fail Closed Mechanism =
{{Fail_Closed_Mechanism}}

Instructions below include a fail closed mechanism.

-----

= VPN Client Choice =
Use OpenVPN.

Using bitmask for this use case is not possible. In other words, you cannot use <code>user -> Tor -> bitmask -> Internet</code>. <ref>
https://github.com/leapcode/bitmask_client/issues/1009
</ref>

Other VPN clients are [[unsupported]]. We are not aware of any sane VPN client choices besides OpenVPN.

-----

= Setup Tor before a VPN (User -> Tor -> VPN -> Internet) =
== Introduction ==
Two methods. 

* [[Qubes-Whonix]] users have the option to use a [[#Separate VPN-Gateway]] but could also use [[#Inside Whonix-Workstation]].
* [[Non-Qubes-Whonix]] users should prefer [[#Inside Whonix-Workstation]].

-----

== Separate VPN-Gateway ==
A separate VPN-Gateway between Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation, i.e. Whonix-Workstation -> VPN-Gateway -> Whonix-Gateway.
 
[[Qubes-Whonix]] only! [[Non-Qubes-Whonix]] is [[unsupported]]!

User -> Tor -> VPN -> Internet

1. Clone a TemplateVM for example, debian-9 and name the new clone debian-9-vpn.

Qube Manager -> debian-9 -> Clone qube -> Enter name for Qube clone : debian-9-vpn

2. Create a new ProxyVM based on the newly cloned template. Name this VM VPN-Gateway and set the Whonix-Gateway TemplateBasedProxyVM (commonly called sys-whonix) as NetVM. Make sure to check [✔] the box for provides_network. 

Qube Manager -> Qube -> Create new qube.

* Name and label: VPN-Gateway (Set any color)
* Type: AppVM
* Template: debian-9-vpn
* Networking: sys-whonix
* Advanced:   [✔] Provides network 
* Press: OK.

3. Set up the VPN-Gateway as per Qubes VPN Documentation. The instructions to configure the VPN gateway using iptables and CLI scripts is preferred to prevent clearnet leaks when the VPN breaks down. 

For example, when a failed closed configuration is used and the VPN connection breaks down, all traffic originating from the Whonix-Workstation AppVM (commonly called anon-whonix) would only be routed through Tor, which would prevent clearnet leaks.

User -> Tor -> Internet 

If a failed closed configuration was not used, network traffic (such as DNS queries) could leak through the VPN tunnel to the Internet when the tunnel connection breaks down.

User -> Tor -> VPN(clearnet leaks!) -> Internet

Note: UDP-style VPN connections are incompatible with Tor which requires that the VPN to be configured to use TCP. To do that, add proto tcp to the VPN configuration file /rw/config/vpn/openvpn-client.ovpn. Most, but not all VPN providers support this configuration. 

4. Check, that your VPN-Gateway is fully functional. Test connectivity from inside the VPN-Gateway as per: Qubes VPN Documentation

5. (Recommended) In Whonix-Workstation (commonly called anon-whonix) apply instructions from the above chapter: Prevent_Bypassing_the_Tunnel-Link. 

When using a separate VPN Gateway no DNS configuration is required. System DNS should work out of the box.<ref> Because a properly configured Qubes VPN-Gateway will be able to resolve DNS.</ref>

If using [[#Tor_Browser]] the following warning will be shown:

Something Went Wrong!
Tor is not working in this browser.

This is because Tor Browser can no longer access Tor's ControPort ([[Dev/CPFP|control-port-filter-proxy-python]]) on Whonix-Gateway.

For troubleshooting, see footnote.
<ref>
* Check, that your VPN-Gateway is fully functional. Test connectivity from inside the VPN-Gateway.
* Add a non-Whonix VM behind your VPN-Gateway. For example, add a debian based AppVM behind your VPN-Gateway. Figure out if the VPN-Gateway works at all before involving Whonix.
</ref>

Done! It is recommended to run the related [[Tunnels/Connecting_to_Tor_before_a_VPN#Leak_Tests| #Leak Tests]].

= Leak Tests =
== Introduction ==
We want to verify, that the traffic always goes {{Code2|User -> Tor -> VPN -> Internet}} and not only {{Code2|User -> Tor -> Internet}}. Therefore you should run the following related leak tests inside Whonix-Workstation. Test Tor Browser, a uwt wrapper deactivated application as well as a regular application for leaks.

== regular application test ==
Same test as above, but use curl without pre-configured [[Stream Isolation|stream isolation]].

<!-- EDITORS NOTE: '{{!}}' is a magic word for '|'.-->
{{CodeSelect|code=
{{Curl_Plain}} --silent {{Curl Secure}} https://check.torproject.org {{!}} grep IP
}}

<ref name=nodns>
In case you have no functional system DNS, you could also alternatively just test TCP.

The IP {{Code2|{{Check.torproject.org_IP}}}} might change. You can find out the current one by running the following command inside a VM that has functional system DNS. (Ideally inside a Whonix-Workstation.)

<pre>
nslookup check.torproject.org
</pre>
</ref> <ref>

<!-- EDITORS NOTE: '{{!}}' is a magic word for '|'.-->
{{CodeSelect|code=
{{Curl_Plain}} --silent {{Curl Secure}} -H 'Host: check.torproject.org' -k https://{{Check.torproject.org IP}} {{!}} grep IP
}}
</ref>

Should show something along the lines: {{Code2|Your IP address appears to be: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx}}<br />
Should show the IP of your VPN.

== uwt wrapped application test ==
Connect to check.torproject.org.

<!-- EDITORS NOTE: '{{!}}' is a magic word for '|'.-->
{{CodeSelect|code=
curl --silent {{Curl Secure}} https://check.torproject.org {{!}} grep IP
}}

<ref name=nodns /> <ref>
<!-- EDITORS NOTE: '{{!}}' is a magic word for '|'.-->
{{CodeSelect|code=
curl --silent {{Curl Secure}} -H 'Host: check.torproject.org' -k https://{{Check.torproject.org IP}} {{!}} grep IP
}}
</ref>

== Browser IP Test ==
You can skip this test if you do not care about using Tor Browser through the VPN.

If you did correctly configure everything, test your setup. Open https://check.torproject.org in Tor Browser. It will tell you then "{{Code2|You are not using Tor.}}" and you'll see your VPN's IP. In fact your VPN was tunneled through Tor first. (Because Whonix-Workstation can not make any non-Tor connections by design, everything is tunneled over Tor.)

== DNS Leak Test ==
{{DNS Leak Tests Online}}

== Other Leak Tests ==
If you are feeling awesome, you could also run more general leak tests that are not related to tunneling. However, these are more difficult to do and target developers rather than users. If you are interested, see [[Dev/Leak_Tests|leak tests]].
