= Fedora =

Consideration for recommending Fedora as host operating system...

Website

* Looks much more friendly and modern.
* It's available over SSL.
* [https://fedoraproject.org/en/verify verification instructions] are also available over SSL.
* gpg signing key is available over SSL.

Package Manager

* yum is safe as apt according to the theupdateframework.com people

Consideration for using it as Virtual Machine Guest

(i.e. for Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation)

* Is there a tool to create virtual machine images like there is grml-debootstrap for Debian? 
** The feature set of grml-debootstrap seems to be a one-liner solution to getting a full working install. 
** Fedora supports kickstart files, which are the equivalent of Debian preseeding. It should conceivably not be too difficult to achieve a grml-deboostrap experience using kickstart files plus some minimal scripting (if one does not exist already). Fedora has automated builds for docker images.
* The more restrictive approach taken by SELinux (which is default in Fedora) might offer some security benefits.

Other stuff.

* Has not been considered yet.

What would be particularly interesting is if Whonix could provide a generalized set of scripts to set up the target environment in as much of a distro-agnostic way as possible (perhaps by leveraging Ansible, or similar).  Making a working Fedora version in addition to Debian might be a start towards that.

Also interesting would be a containerized version of the Whonix-gateway that could be easily deployed on a host OS (this provides less anonymity than what Whonix is mainly aiming at, but has different use cases): For example, setting up an OnionPi-style hotspot.  Current solutions, like the Adafruit OnionPi tutorial, are (1) not very easily deployable, (2) not as feature-full -- for example, limited to HTTP or particular protocols -- not full isolating proxies, and (3) tend to have a large footprint on the host/root OS -- ideally, one Raspi could be used both for providing a Tor Hotspot and for numerous other functions, with the Tor hotspot functions contained in one LXC and using only a handful of ports and hardware interfaces from the host OS.

= Debugging Scriptlets =
1) Add the prerun scriptlet to a file by running the following command (credit<ref>Thanks to airfishey for it's [http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/214193/49297 answer] on unix.stackexchange.</ref>):

<pre>
rpm -q --queryformat '%{PREUN}\n' qubes-template-whonix-gw-experimental > ~/qubes-template-whonix-gw-experimental.preun
</pre>

2) Run that script as root while having {{Code2|errexit}}, {{Code2|xtrace}} enabled and output exit code:

<pre>
sudo sh -ex ~/qubes-template-whonix-gw-experimental.preun 0 ; echo $?
</pre>

Trivia:<br />
The file name {{Code2|qubes-template-whonix-gw-experimental.preun}} actually doesn't matter. You could use a shorter file name.
