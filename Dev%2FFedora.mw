__FORCETOC__

= Fedora =

Consideration for recommending Fedora as host operating system...

Website

* Looks much more friendly and modern.
* It's available over SSL.
* [https://fedoraproject.org/en/verify verification instructions] are also available over SSL.
* gpg signing key is available over SSL.

Package Manager

* yum is safe as apt according to the theupdateframework.com people

Consideration for using it as Virtual Machine Guest

(i.e. for Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation)

* Is there a tool to create virtual machine images like there is grml-debootstrap for Debian?

Other stuff.

* Has not been considered yet.

= Debugging Scriptlets =
1) Add the prerun scriptlet to a file by running the following command (credit<ref>Thanks to airfishey for it's [http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/214193/49297 answer] on unix.stackexchange.</ref>):

<pre>
rpm -q --queryformat '%{PREUN}\n' qubes-template-whonix-gw-experimental > ~/qubes-template-whonix-gw-experimental.preun
</pre>

2) Run that script as root while having {{Code2|errexit}} and {{Code2|xtrace}} enabled:

<pre>
sudo sh -ex ~/qubes-template-whonix-gw-experimental.preun ; echo $?
</pre>

Trivia:<br />
The file name {{Code2|qubes-template-whonix-gw-experimental.preun}} actually doesn't matter. You could use a shorter file name.
