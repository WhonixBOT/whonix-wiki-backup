<pre>## What does it do: Disable KDE Bluetooth integration

## Whonix: Not required in Whonix 
[Module-bluedevil]

kcmshell4 --list | grep mount, gives me device_automounter_kcm, with a description: "Configure automatic handling of removable storage media".<br />kcmshell4 device_automounter_kcm give me... well you can try it.

Of course that's the Removable Device Automounter, as listed in the services configuration (kcmkded).

Without this module running the new removable device should still show up in device-notifier, but the configured automount actions won't occur.<br />This one will strongly depend on whether the user is willing to jump thru manual hoops to mount a newly plugged removable storage device, or would prefer that kde handled it even at the expense of a bit of kde startup speed and memory for the automounting service. Of course people like me don't like kde mounting stuff behind their back anyway, so turning it off is an easy choice here, but a lot of users want the system to handle it... if they even know anything about mounting to begin with.

## the other directories which you can configure it to monitor are
## running out of space. 
## Source: http://packages.debian.org/unstable/main/freespacenotifier
## Whonix: We should probably leave it enabled.

http://lists.kde.org/?l=kde&m=136497689725852&w=2 I /think/ this is Network Status in kcmkded. But as I don't run network-manager or the like at all, instead using initscripts for my network management, I have absolutely no experience with this.

<pre>

http://lists.kde.org/?l=kde&m=136497689725852&w=2 kcmkded says display management change monitor. Probably useful for laptop users that often plug external monitors or who frequently change resolution, not so much for folks who always run the same monitor config and resolution.

[Module-randrmonitor]
autoload=false

http://lists.kde.org/?l=kde&m=136497689725852&w=2 Remote URL change notifier. For those with network folders this is probably useful. Otherwise, not so much.

## What does it do: To start the kde session fresh, it makes the applications
## that was open (with tabs and contents), to start again without any kind of
## data. It wipes the applications that were open from the desktop.

= Desktop Icons =
[[File:Symlink.png]]

The arrows and italic font of the desktop icons is ugly.

They are arrows and italic font, because the desktop icons are symlinks.

Using symlinks has several advantages.
# prevents code duplication
# to prevent writing into the user's home folder <ref>Litian will complain when shipping files in /home/*.</ref> <ref>Debian developers are strictly against writing into /home/. It's against Debian policy. Writing into /home/ reduces chances that Whonix gets some day merged into Debian (at least big parts of it). Getting big parts merged into Debian would be a major advantage.</ref>
# being able to update for example /usr/share/applications/whonix/whonix-whonixcheck.desktop <ref>update as in: new icon, new description, translations, who knows...</ref>
# the user is free to delete them and to prevent getting them re-added by blacklisting the responsible postinst.d script

There will be no arrows, if they are copies and chmod +x. Using copies is no real alternative due to the advantages listed above.

The real fix is an open question for research:

'''How to tell KDE to use no arrows and no italic font for symlinked desktop icons?'''
