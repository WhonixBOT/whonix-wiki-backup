TODO: Review and update

kdedrc

<pre>## What does it do: Disable KDE Bluetooth integration
## Source: http://userbase.kde.org/Bluedevil
## Whonix: Not required in {{project name}} 
[Module-bluedevil]

kcmshell4 --list | grep mount, gives me device_automounter_kcm, with a description: "Configure automatic handling of removable storage media".<br />kcmshell4 device_automounter_kcm give me... well you can try it.

Of course that's the Removable Device Automounter, as listed in the services configuration (kcmkded).

Without this module running the new removable device should still show up in device-notifier, but the configured automount actions won't occur.<br />This one will strongly depend on whether the user is willing to jump thru manual hoops to mount a newly plugged removable storage device, or would prefer that kde handled it even at the expense of a bit of kde startup speed and memory for the automounting service. Of course people like me don't like kde mounting stuff behind their back anyway, so turning it off is an easy choice here, but a lot of users want the system to handle it... if they even know anything about mounting to begin with.

[Module-dnssdwatcher]

## What does it do: This module notifies the user when /home or one of
## the other directories which you can configure it to monitor are
## running out of space. 
## Source: http://packages.debian.org/unstable/main/freespacenotifier
## Whonix: We should probably leave it enabled.

http://lists.kde.org/?l=kde&m=136497689725852&w=2 I /think/ this is Network Status in kcmkded. But as I don't run network-manager or the like at all, instead using initscripts for my network management, I have absolutely no experience with this.

[Module-obexftpdaemon]

http://lists.kde.org/?l=kde&m=136497689725852&w=2 kcmkded says display management change monitor. Probably useful for laptop users that often plug external monitors or who frequently change resolution, not so much for folks who always run the same monitor config and resolution.

<pre>
[Module-randrmonitor]
autoload=false
</pre>

http://lists.kde.org/?l=kde&m=136497689725852&w=2 Remote URL change notifier. For those with network folders this is probably useful. Otherwise, not so much.

[Module-remotedirnotify]

= Desktop Icons =
[[File:Symlink.png]]

The arrows and italic font of the desktop icons is ugly.

They are arrows and italic font, because the desktop icons are symlinks.

Using symlinks has several advantages.
# prevents code duplication
# to prevent writing into the user's home folder <ref>Litian will complain when shipping files in /home/*.</ref> <ref>Debian developers are strictly against writing into /home/. It is against Debian policy. Writing into /home/ reduces chances that {{project name}} gets some day merged into Debian (at least big parts of it). Getting big parts merged into Debian would be a major advantage.</ref>
# being able to update for example /usr/share/applications/whonix/whonix-whonixcheck.desktop <ref>update as in: new icon, new description, translations, who knows...</ref>
# the user is free to delete them and to prevent getting them re-added by blacklisting the responsible postinst.d script

There will be no arrows, if they are copies and chmod +x. Using copies is no real alternative due to the advantages listed above.

The real fix is an open question for research:

'''How to tell KDE to use no arrows and no italic font for symlinked desktop icons?'''

** Folderview is default in Plasma 5.10; Won't be in debian until 2036

** Method 2: contents/default
** Global default for new users is in /usr/share/plasma/shells/org.kde.plasma.desktop/contents/defaults
*** The line "Containment=" should be changed to "Containment=org.kde.plasma.folder"
** Method 3: XDG. Probably doesn't work. Only scripting or contents/default
*** Placing plasma-org.kde.plasma.desktop-appletsrc in a current used XDG_CONFIG_DIR directory (for test), with the text: "[Containments][1]" "plugin=org.kde.plasma.folder" has no effect.
*** Asked https://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=289&t=141930&p=381724
** Methods 4: /etc/skel
*** User's config is ~/.config/plasma-org.kde.plasma.desktop-appletsrc 
*** Line 15, under [Containments][1], needs to change to "plugin=org.kde.plasma.folder"
