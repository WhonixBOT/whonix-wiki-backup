= Verify the virtual machine images using the command line =

You need to have GnuPG installed. GnuPG is the common OpenPGP implementation for Linux: it is installed by default under Debian, Ubuntu, Whonix and many other distributions.

First, download the [[Whonix Signing Key]].

Open a terminal and import Whonix signing key with the following commands:

<pre>
cd [the directory in which you downloaded the key]
cat adrelanos.asc | gpg --keyid-format long --import
</pre>

The output should tell you that the key was imported:

<pre>
gpg: key 9C131AD3713AAEEF: public key "adrelanos <adrelanos at riseup dot net>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1)
</pre>

'''If you had already imported Whonix signing key in the past''', the output should tell you that the key was not changed:

<pre>
gpg: key 9C131AD3713AAEEF: "adrelanos <adrelanos at riseup dot net>" not changed
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:              unchanged: 1
</pre>

'''If you are shown the following message''' at the end of the output:

<pre>
gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found
</pre>

Analyse the other messages as usual: this extra message doesn't relate to the Whonix signing key that you downloaded and usually means that you didn't create an OpenPGP key for yourself yet, which is of no importance to verify the virtual machine images.

Now, '''download the cryptographic signature''' corresponding to the virtual machine images you want to verify and save it in the same folder as the virtual machine images:

[[Download#Whonix_signature]]

Then, '''start the cryptographic verification''', it can take several minutes:

<pre>
cd [the directory in which you downloaded the .ova and the .asc]
gpg --keyid-format long --verify Whonix-Gateway-7.ova.asc Whonix-Gateway-7.ova
</pre>

'''If the Virtual Machine image is correct''' the output will tell you that the signature is good:

<pre>
gpg: Signature made Sun Nov 25 21:48:54 2012 UTC
gpg:                using RSA key 9C131AD3713AAEEF
gpg: Good signature from "adrelanos <adrelanos at riseup dot net"
</pre>

This might be followed by a warning saying:

<pre>
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 9B15 7153 925C 303A 4225  3AFB 9C13 1AD3 713A AEEF
</pre>

This doesn't alter the validity of the signature according to the key you downloaded. This warning rather has to do with the trust that you put in Whonix signing key. See, [[Whonix Signing Key]]. To remove this warning you would have to personally sign Whonix signing key with your own key.

'''If the Virtual Machine image is not correct''' the output will tell you that the signature is bad:

<pre>
gpg: Signature made Sun Nov 25 21:48:54 2012 UTC
gpg:                using RSA key 9C131AD3713AAEEF
gpg: BAD signature from "adrelanos <adrelanos at riseup dot net>"
</pre>

'''Repeat these steps for Whonix-Workstation as well.'''

<pre>
cd [the directory in which you downloaded the .ova and the .asc]
gpg --keyid-format long --verify Whonix-Workstation-7.ova.asc Whonix-Workstation-7.ova
</pre>
