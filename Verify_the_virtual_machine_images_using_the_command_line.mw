|description=Instructions for OpenPGP Verification of Whonix using Command Line
}}

You need to have GnuPG installed. GnuPG is the common OpenPGP implementation for Linux: it is installed by default under Debian, Ubuntu, Whonix and many other distributions.

Import the signing key, refer to the [[Whonix Signing Key]] instructions.

Now, '''download the cryptographic (OpenPGP) signature''' corresponding to the virtual machine images you want to verify and save it in the same folder as the virtual machine images:

Download Whonix Signature: [[VirtualBox#Whonix_signature|VirtualBox]] | [[KVM#Whonix_signature|KVM]]

Then, '''start the cryptographic verification''', it can take several minutes.

{{CodeSelect|code=
cd [the directory in which you downloaded the .ova and the .asc]
}}
{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --verify-options show-notations --verify Whonix-Gateway-*.ova.asc Whonix-Gateway-*.ova
}}

'''If the Virtual Machine image is correct''' the output will tell you that the signature is good:

<pre>
gpg: Signature made Mon 19 Jan 2015 11:45:41 PM CET using RSA key ID 77BB3C48
gpg: Good signature from "Patrick Schleizer <adrelanos@riseup.net>" [unknown]
gpg: Signature notation: issuer-fpr@notations.openpgp.fifthhorseman.net=6E979B28A6F37C43BE30AFA1CB8D50BB77BB3C48
gpg: Signature notation: file@name=Whonix-Gateway-9.6.ova
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 916B 8D99 C38E AF5E 8ADC  7A2A 8D66 066A 2EEA CCDA
     Subkey fingerprint: 6E97 9B28 A6F3 7C43 BE30  AFA1 CB8D 50BB 77BB 3C48
</pre>

This might be followed by a warning saying:
{{Template:GnuPG-Warning}}

{{gpg_signature_timestamp}}

The first line includes the signature creation timestamp. Example.

<pre>
gpg: Signature made Mon 19 Jan 2015 11:45:41 PM CET using RSA key ID 77BB3C48
</pre>

{{GnuPG_file_names}}

To help you check, that the file name has not been tampered with, beginning from Whonix version 9.6 and above, by convention, the {{Code2|file@name}} OpenPGP notation includes the file name. See example below.

<pre>
gpg: Signature notation: file@name=Whonix-Gateway-9.6.ova
</pre>

'''If the Virtual Machine image is not correct''' the output will tell you that the signature is bad:

<pre>
gpg: Signature made Sun Nov 25 21:48:54 2012 UTC
gpg:                using RSA key 77BB3C48
gpg: BAD signature from "Patrick Schleizer <adrelanos@riseup.net>"
</pre>

'''Repeat these steps for Whonix-Workstation as well.'''

{{CodeSelect|code=
cd [the directory in which you downloaded the .ova and the .asc]
}}
{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --verify-options show-notations --verify Whonix-Workstation-*.ova.asc Whonix-Workstation-*.ova
}}
