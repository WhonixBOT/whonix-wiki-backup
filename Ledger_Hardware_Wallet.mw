[https://www.ledger.com/ Ledger wallets] are a special type of commercial bitcoin wallet whereby a user's private keys are stored in a secure hardware device. Other commercial alternatives include Pi Wallet, TREZOR, BWALLET, KeepKey, Opendime, CoolWallet and others.

The major advantages of hardware wallets over software wallets include: <ref>
https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hardware_wallet
</ref>

* Usually private keys are stored in a protected area of a microcontroller, and cannot be transferred out of the device in plaintext.
* Resistance to computer viruses that target theft from software wallets.
* More secure and interactive than paper wallets that require importation to software.
* Usually software on the device is open source.

The main principle is that cryptographic secrets (private keys) are fully isolated from easy-to-hack computers or smartphones. Ledger wallets use secure chips that are similar to the technology used in chip and PIN payment cards or SIM cards. <ref>
https://ledger.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005198485-Hardware-wallets-FAQ
</ref>

= Security Factors =
== Essentials ==
Learn from Ledger and/or other authoritative sources:

* What is a seed phrase?
* [https://blog.kraken.com/post/6746/ledger-phishing-scam-targets-crypto-hardware-wallet-users/ Ledger Phishing Scam Targets Crypto Hardware Wallet Users]
* 
{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text    = Never enter the seed phrase on any electronic device except the hardware wallet!
}}
* [https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002481534-Check-if-device-is-genuine Check if device is genuine]

== Security Risks ==

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text    = '''Warning:''' Hardware wallets are not bulletproof. The user must be sure to purchase a good-quality, authentic device manufactured by a trustworthy and technically competent company with a good reputation in security.
}}

Potential risks of hardware wallets include: <ref>
https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hardware_wallet
</ref>

* <u>Compromised production process</u>: Hardware backdoors could be introduced via intentional or unintentional actions that leaves security holes in the final product.
* <u>Device interdiction</u>: No hardware wallet solution can deal with the threat of government programs that intercept hardware and modify them in transit to introduce backdoors.
* <u>Imperfect implementation</u>: If bugs are present in the software, firmware or hardware, then attackers may be able to gain unauthorized access to the hardware wallet. 
* <u>Insecure Random Number Generator (RNG)</u>: Security is reliant upon true randomness being generated by the source of entropy for the RNG, since it generates the wallet's private keys. This is hard to verify, and attackers may be able to recreate wallet keys if the RNG is insecure. <ref>
The attacker generates psuedo-randomness that is indistinguishable from true randomness, but is still predictable.
</ref>
*  <u>Malware swapping recipient Bitcoin addresses</u>: Malware on a PC could potentially trick the user into sending Bitcoin to the wrong address. Multi-factor confirmation of a recipient's Bitcoin address mitigates this risk.

Despite these risks, hardware wallets are considered a higher security solution than software wallets, since the latter must make private keys available in plain text in the computer's memory when transactions are signed -- any compromise by Bitcoin-targeting malware would enable theft of Bitcoins. <ref>
https://ledger.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005198485-Hardware-wallets-FAQ
</ref>

== Seed Backup Security ==

It is definitively safer to have at least two Ledger hardware wallets. During initial setup the Ledger does not verify all words of the seed; it only verifies two words of the 24-word seed. This means if one word is mistyped, it will be difficult later on to regain access to personal coins. On the other hand, two Ledgers using the same seed should generate the same addresses, which proves the seed was correctly backed up.

Seed testing applications are available like [https://github.com/parkerhoyes/bolos-app-seedutility BOLOS Seed Utility App]. <ref>
<blockquote>This repository contains an application for the Ledger Nano S that allows the user to verify the backup of their BIP 39 mnemonic by comparing it to the master seed stored on the device.</blockquote>
</ref> <ref>
https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/6ez4qs/ledger_nano_s_seed_utility_app_released/
</ref> It is probably safer to avoid these tools since they are maintained by a third party and this adds complexity to the procedure.

Another alternative is to:

# note some generated addresses
# reset the Ledger
# re-setup with the seed and see if it still uses the same addresses

== Wallet Testing Security ==

Before storing any significant funds in a wallet, it is recommended to first test sending a small amount there and then trying to send it back. The reason is software bugs could potentially lead to the presentation of an address where the user does not own the corresponding private key.

The threat of losing funds due to software bugs is not just hypothetical. For instance, [https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/48rt6n/using_myetherwalletcom_just_burned_me_for/ this user] <ref>
[http://www.webcitation.org/6ucscCGxX Web citation].
</ref> utilizing MyEtherWallet.com lost over one thousand dollars due to a historical bug in the Ethereum Javascript implementation.

= Installation =
== USB ==
{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = A USB port is required if using the Nano S, Nano or HW1 Ledger hardware wallets.

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = Ledger USB device will not be detected by the computer before the PIN has been entered. <ref>
This is probably because Ledger does not announce itself before that.
</ref> Before proceeding:

# Physically connect the Ledger hardware wallet to a USB port.
# Turn on Ledger.
# Enter the PIN on the Ledger.
}}

== Virtualizer Specific Settings ==
=== VirtualBox ===
{{project name}} [[VirtualBox]] users only:

Add the Ledger hardware wallet to the virtual machine (VM).

# Power off the VM.
# <code>Virtual machine</code> &rarr; <code>Menu</code> &rarr; <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code>USB</code> &rarr; <code>USB</code> &rarr; check <code>Enable USB Controller</code> &rarr; press <code>+</code> &rarr; check <code>Ledger</code> &rarr; <code>OK</code>
# Power on the VM.

[[Dev/VirtualBox#VirtualBox_Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack|VirtualBox Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack]] <u>not</u> required.

=== KVM ===
{{project name}} [[KVM]] users only:

Add the Ledger hardware wallet to the virtual machine (VM).

[[Undocumented]].

=== Qubes ===
{{Q project name}} users note:

For better usability, it is discouraged to start with a Ledger hardware wallet. First learn how to pass any other, "simpler"; USB device to an AppVM and attempt that procedure in order to iron out any eventual Qubes USBVM issues. Any eventual Qubes USBVM issues are Qubes support issues. Not {{project name}} support issues.

Install Qubes USB Proxy. This step is mandatory for [[Qubes]] users. <ref>
See:

</ref>

{{Install_Package|package=
qubes-usb-proxy
}}

== Electrum Installation ==

This step is optional and only necessary if you intend to use Electrum.

[[Electrum]] is installed by default in {{Workstation product name}}, but several dependencies are required for a hardware wallet. <ref>

{{Install_Package|package=
libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev python3-btchip
}}

<ref>
This is probably outdated:

* Was not required. <code>ln -s /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libudev.so.1 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libudev.so</code>
* https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/3422#issuecomment-348063118
* Install <code>python3-btchip</code> (<code>btchip-python</code> ?). Unfortunately it is not available from Debian's repository. Therefore we have to install it using python-pip.

TODO: bug report against https://packages.debian.org/{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}/python-btchip ?

= Usage =
== Ledger Live ==
# Physically connect the Ledger hardware wallet to a USB port.
# Enter the PIN on the Ledger.
# Start the <code>Ledger VM</code>.

Start Ledger Live.

{{CodeSelect|code=
./ledger-live-desktop-2.21.3-linux-x86_64.AppImage
}}

Refer to usage instructions to by upstream, Ledger.

== Electrum ==
Same basic steps as for [[#Ledger Live|Ledger Live]] but then start Electrum, not Ledger Live.

Do not attempt to run Electrum and Ledger Live at the same time. This is a Ledger limitation, unrelated to {{project name}}.

An Electrum wallet will only show legacy bitcoin addresses and their balances or segwit wallet bitcoin addresses and their balances, not both. It is possible to have multiple Electrum wallets and switch between them.

Electrum will ask for <code>derivation path</code>.

* The default is <code>m/44'/0'/0'</code> for legacy bitcoin addresses.
* You should use <code>m/49'/0'/0'</code> for segwit bitcoin addresses.

= Troubleshooting =
== BIOS ==

The USB device might be passed to the <code>Ledger VM</code>, but Ledger applications may not recognize the Ledger hardware wallet. If that occurs, try the following in BIOS settings:

* disable <code>Legacy USB Support</code>
* disable <code>XHCI Pre-Boot Mode</code>
* attempt flipping other USB-related BIOS options

It is unnecessary to reinstall Qubes.

== Ledger ==

To troubleshoot Ledger problems, try the following:

* Use the <code>Mananger</code> tab in Ledger Live first.
* Qubers users note: Update the firmware of the Ledger hardware wallet by connecting it to a non-Qubes Linux computer (where connections are possibly using Ledger Live).

== Try with Debian First ==
Issues which are not caused by {{project name}}:

# Using Ledger on (Debian) Linux can be challenging.
# Using USB devices with VirtualBox can be challenging.
# Using Ledger with a virtualizer such as VirtualBox can be challenging.

Therefore, as per [[Free Support Principle]]:

# Learn how to use Ledger on a Debian host.
# Learn how to use USB devices with your choice of virtualizer.
# Learn how to use Ledger with Debian inside VirtualBox.

Only after completing these steps, try to use Ledger in a {{project name}} VM. 

== Qubes R4 ==

The Qubes R4 USB widget formerly had bugs such as showing the USB device was connected to a VM while <code>qvm-usb</code> -- the command line authority whose judgment should be trusted more -- disagreed or showed the same USB device more than once in the menu. <ref>
[https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/3266 USB devices shown multiple times in devices popup menu #3266]
</ref>

If similar issues re-emerge, follow these steps.

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Physically connect the Ledger hardware wallet to a USB port.<br />
'''2.''' Run the following command to get an overview of USB devices detected by Qubes.

{{CodeSelect|code=
qvm-usb
}}

'''3.''' Check the output is similar to the following.

<pre>
BACKEND:DEVID  DESCRIPTION               USED BY
sys-usb:2-1.1  Logitech_USB_Keyboard     
sys-usb:2-1.2  PixArt_USB_Optical_Mouse  
sys-usb:2-1.4  Ledger_Nano_S_0001        
</pre>

'''4.''' Use the following command to connect the Ledger hardware wallet to the preferred VM. 

Replace <code>ledger-debian-buster</code> with the actual name of the VM.

{{CodeSelect|code=
qvm-usb attach ledger-debian-buster sys-usb:2-1.4
}}
}}
