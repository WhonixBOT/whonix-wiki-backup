{{Anchor|Restrict Hardware Information to Root}}
== Reduce Kernel Information Leaks ==
* <u>Security Impact</u>: There are many of hardware, kernel, debug information, etc. in <code>/sys</code>, which is especially problematic and has been the cause of many infoleaks such as kernel pointer leaks.
* <u>Privacy/Anonymity Impact</u>: Details about your hardware can be used for identification.
* <u>Threat</u>: This information is per Debian (and probably most popular Linux distributions) available to attackers with local code execution privileges which includes,
** malicious applications collecting such information and submitting it to data collectors,
** as well as both, compromised non-privileged users and the privileged root user.
* <u>Non-Threat</u>: This information does not randomly leak to third parties on clean (non-compromised) machines through use of legitimate applications such as the APT package manager.
* <u>Goal</u>: This information should by default be unavailable to non-privileged users and [[Dev/boot_modes|untrusted root]].
* <u>Solution</u>: Therefore security-misc includes the <code>hide-hardware-info.service</code> systemd unit.
** Restricts access to <code>/sys</code>, <code>/proc/cpuinfo</code>, <code>/proc/bus</code>, and <code>/proc/scsi</code> to the root user only.
** This also hides most hardware identifiers.
* <u>Status</u>: This setting is disabled by default because it might break many applications. Testers-only! Call for testers and forum discussion: [https://forums.whonix.org/t/restrict-hardware-information-to-root-testers-wanted/8618 Restrict Hardware Information to Root - Testers Wanted!]
* <u>Enable</u>: It can optionally be enabled by running the following command.
** {{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl enable hide-hardware-info.service
}}
** Reboot required.
** A whitelist that allows specific applications to access <code>/sys</code> and <code>/proc/cpuinfo</code> is enabled by default to maintain basic functionality. <ref>
https://gitlab.com/whonix/security-misc/-/blob/master/lib/systemd/system/user@.service.d/sysfs.conf
</ref> For example, this allows the launching of applications like XFCE.
* <u>Limitations of Solution</u>:
** Attackers which gained root compromise and/or malicious/compromised whitelisted applications have access to this information.
** Cannot hide [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPUID CPUID]. <ref>

=== Whitelisting Applications ===

To whitelist applications, they must be run under the <code>sysfs</code> group (if allowing access to <code>/sys</code>) and/or the <code>cpuinfo</code> group (if allowing access to <code>/proc/cpuinfo</code>).

For example, to add user <code>user</code> to group <code>cpuinfo</code>, run the following command. (Note, this is weakening protections.)

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo addgroup user cpuinfo
}}

For example, to add user <code>user</code> to group <code>sysfs</code>, run the following command. (Note, this is weakening protections.)

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo addgroup user sysfs
}}

Re-login required after changing groups. Easiest: reboot. <ref>
No reboot required: Use the execute command as different group ID command line utility <code>sg</code> to execute the <code>cpu-info</code> (from Debian package <code>cpuinfo</code>) application under group <code>cpuinfo</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sg cpuinfo cpu-info
}}
</ref> <ref>
Also no reboot required:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo -u user bash
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
cpu-info
}}

Or.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo -u user cpu-info
}}
</ref>

For example, to run a systemd service as the <code>sysfs</code> group, create a [[Configuration_Files#Configuration_Drop-In_Folders|drop-in directory]] and add the following.

{{CodeSelect|code=
[Service]
SupplementaryGroups=sysfs
}}

To run a specific binary as the <code>sysfs</code> group, the binary must be owned by the <code>sysfs</code> group and be made setgid. To achieve this, change the ownership of the binary by running the following.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo chgrp sysfs /path/to/binary
}}

Then make the binary setgid.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo chmod g+s /path/to/binary
}}

The binary will now run with the permissions of the <code>sysfs</code> group and have access to <code>/sys</code>.

All of these steps can also be applied to the <code>cpuinfo</code> group.

Remember that any whitelisted applications add to the attack surface. An attacker can attempt to exploit a vulnerability in the whitelisted application(s) to gain access to hardware information.

=== Disable the Whitelist ===

In order to reduce the attack surface as much as possible, optionally the whitelist can be disabled entirely.

{{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/hide-hardware-info.d/30_whitelist.conf
}}

Uncomment the <code>sysfs_whitelist=0</code> and <code>cpuinfo_whitelist=0</code> sections to disable the whitelist.

Note that this setting will break many applications; for example, the desktop environment will not even start. Do not perform this action unless you understand the implications and can reverse the change.
