Undocumented, Untested or Unsupported Features
}}
[[image:Unsupported.jpg|thumb|250px]]

This wiki chapter refers to features that are presently either undocumented, untested or unsupported. Simply put, due to the wide-ranging nature of anonymous activities undertaken by the {{Whonix}} community it is inevitable that certain features or requests will:
* have undocumented, incomplete or outdated instructions or use cases
* remain untested by either developers or the community
* have complex installation and configuration requirements for full or partial functionality
* not be implemented in the {{Whonix}} source code

The {{Whonix}} project is highly receptive to the efforts of community members who take the time to identify shortcomings and share their ideas, literary or coding skills to improve the platform, particularly in the domains of software contributions, testing, forum offerings or documentation additions/improvements. 

Community members can help ensure the continued success of {{Whonix}} through four primary means:
# providing [[Reporting_Bugs#Community_Feedback|Community Feedback]]
# helping to implement features as a [[Contribute#Contributor|contributor]]
# purchasing [[Professional Support]] so additional features can be implemented, documented, tested and/or further supported
# embracing the [[Free Support Principle]] and becoming an active [[Free_Support_Principle#The_User_Co-developer_Concept|user co-developer]]

In summary, developers view the broader {{Whonix}} community as an essential part of the strategy to realize a highly-secure and anonymous platform with a host of valuable features. By assisting with undocumented, untested or unsupported features/feature requests, individuals can assist in achieving shared goals and the ultimate progression of the {{Whonix}} development roadmap. All contributions, big or small, can lead to promising new security or privacy protections. This is true even if progress is only incremental or due for later implementation.
