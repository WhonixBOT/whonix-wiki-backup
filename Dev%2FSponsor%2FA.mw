= Usability Improvements =
== Make Whonix software translatable ==
https://translatewiki.net has a pool of translation volunteers. Once Whonix gets {{Code|gettext}}ified, Whonix could apply for translatewiki.net and they could start translating Whonix software.

== Make whonix.org translatable ==
We yet have to figure out how to use the translation extension and to prepare whonix.org's documentation for translation. We occasionally have offers to translate whonix.org, for [https://www.whonix.org/pipermail/whonix-devel/2014-March/000143.html example to French]. Whonix developer Patrick Schleizer could translate whonix.org to German.

== Language Selector ==
As a new part of Whonix First Time Setup (which starts after Whonix starts for the first time), the user could be asked which language she wants to use.

= Windows Support =
Something around [[Other Operating Systems]]. Provide a script and instructions related to [[Other Operating Systems]], to make routing Windows through Whonix-Gateway (Tor) easier and safer. 

= Contribution Scalability and Security Improvement =
Whonix consists of roughly 25.000 lines of code. Mostly all in one git repository. To professionalize Whonix's source code, it would be better if Whonix was split into multiple packages. That would make it simpler to grasp Whonix's architecture, make it simpler to contribute to Whonix, simpler to audit the critical parts of Whonix and simpler to port Whonix to other targets.

= Security Improvements =
== Check for Revocation Certificates before running apt-get ==
Copied from https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/125

Neither Debian nor Whonix has no good mechanism to revoke apt keys in case of compromise, neither a way to inform users in emergency situations:
https://lists.debian.org/debian-security/2013/10/msg00065.html

An apt key revoker should be written:
https://lists.debian.org/debian-security/2013/12/msg00031.html

And up-streamed to Debian.

* Keyservers may not be used: https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/sks-devel/2013-12/msg00076.html
* The code for downloading the revocation certificates should be configurable. .d style configuration folder. Where distributions and PPA's can drop configuration snippets. Using arrays.
* Code should be re-usable for Whonix News key revocation as well (using plugin).
