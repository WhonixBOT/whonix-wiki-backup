= Overview =
The work outlined here is specifically focused on what could be done in a year with funding, though these goals should be considered as a larger roadmap for Whonix's development in general. This roadmap is focused on three goals: 

1. make Whonix more sustainable by making it easier for the community to engage and contribute code
2. make Whonix more secure
3. make Whonix more usable by average users in repressive situations


= Sustainability =
Given that Whonix was created by the community and is supported by the community, it is of the utmost importance that Whonix continues to do so.


== Contribution Scalability and Security Improvement ==
Whonix consists of roughly 25.000 lines of code. Mostly all in one git repository. To streamline the development Whonix's source code, it would be better if Whonix was split into multiple packages. That would make it simpler to grasp Whonix's architecture, make it simpler to contribute to Whonix, simpler to audit the critical parts of Whonix and simpler to port Whonix to other targets.


= Security =
Whonix's primary goal is security, without it nothing matters.'''
'''Patrick, can you expand the issues in this section and make them each focused, say 3 main security issues that should be dealt with over the next year'''


== Check for Revocation Certificates before running apt-get ==
Copied from https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/125

Neither Debian nor Whonix has no good mechanism to revoke apt keys in case of compromise, neither a way to inform users in emergency situations:
https://lists.debian.org/debian-security/2013/10/msg00065.html

An apt key revoker should be written:
https://lists.debian.org/debian-security/2013/12/msg00031.html

And up-streamed to Debian.

* Keyservers may not be used: https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/sks-devel/2013-12/msg00076.html
* The code for downloading the revocation certificates should be configurable. .d style configuration folder. Where distributions and PPA's can drop configuration snippets. Using arrays.
* Code should be re-usable for Whonix News key revocation as well (using plugin).

== Secure Distributed Network Time Synchronization ==
Host operating systems such as Debian and Ubuntu have no way for secure and trust distributed network time synchronization, although that is crucial for security. ([https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=%23687166 Debian bug confirmation]; [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ntp/+bug/1039420 Ubuntu bug confirmation]). Whonix already comes with a secure replacement as described on that [[Dev/TimeSync]] page. That mechanism should be split of Whonix's source code and be made a separate project available as a package (.deb), that users can download and install. Debian developers should then be encouraged to add that package to their offical repository, so it gets even simpler to install it (such as, as simple as {{Code|sudo apt-get install sdwdate}}). If Debian developers are not interested, Whonix developers should attempt to become a Debian maintainer as well and maintain the package themselves in Debian. (From Debian, that package will flow down to other Debian-based distributions such as Ubuntu, Mint, etc.)

= Usability =
Currently, to use Whonix a user must get familiar with Virtual Box and Debian (KDE) to be able to use and configure Whonix. In order to allow those with less time/access to expert knowledge of Linux, who may be in areas where time and security are of the essence, usability issues must be a top priority. 

== Interaction Simplification and Standardization ==
Whonix needs an interaction designer to review and plan and implement an across the board standardization of the look and feel of Whonix in the system itself and online.

== Other Operating System Support ==
Not everyone that needs privacy or security can use Unix. Whonix aims to support a Mac OS X or Windows virtual workstation that uses the Whonix Gateway to route all traffic through TOR. 

== Whonix Language Support ==

=== Language Selector ===
As a new part of Whonix First Time Setup (which starts after Whonix starts for the first time), the user could be asked which language she wants to use.

=== Translation for Whonix ===
https://translatewiki.net has a pool of translation volunteers. Once Whonix gets {{Code|gettext}}ified, Whonix could apply for translatewiki.net and they could start translating Whonix software.

=== Translation for Documentation ===
We yet have to figure out how to use the translation extension and to prepare whonix.org's documentation for translation. We occasionally have offers to translate whonix.org, for [https://www.whonix.org/pipermail/whonix-devel/2014-March/000143.html example to French]. Whonix developer Patrick Schleizer could translate whonix.org to German.
