{{project name}} Policy On Non-Freedom Software
}}

The {{project name}} project is a Freedom Software project.

It is not a Freedom Software maximalist project, i.e. not adhering to [https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.en.html Free System Distribution Guidelines (GNU FSDG)] ([https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-and-free-system-distribution-guidelines-gnu-fsdg/5877 forum discussion]). It however also will not bundle unnecessary major non-freedom software software components or contribute to these.

Permitted:

* Helping users asking about non-freedom software.
** Example. Question: "How to use Wickr?" Answer: "See wiki page [[Wickr]]." - Permitted.
* Community contributed documentation about popular non-freedom software such as [[VMware]].
* Discussions about Freedom Software that rely on Non-Freedom server software.
** Example: Telegram Client (Freedom Software) that requires to connect to Telegram server (Non-Freedom Software).
* Discussion about Freedom Software alternatives to non-freedom software.
** Example: Question: "What's a Libre alternative to team viewer?" Answer: "See [[Remote Administration]] wiki page."
* Running {{project name}} on top of non-freedom operating systems such as [[Windows]], [[macOS]].
* Non-freedom [[Firmware Security and Updates]] and [[Firmware_Security_and_Updates#Processor_Microcode_Updates|Processor Microcode Updates]].

Prohibited:

* Unsolicited recommendations of non-freedom applications.
** Example. Question: "How to use remote support?" Answer "use anydesk". - Prohibited.
* Debates about features and security of closed vs Open Source Software are unwelcome.

Contributions to Non-Freedom Software:

* Examples:
** Non-freedom software hypervisors such as VMware <ref>

</ref> and Hyper-V.

** [https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-host-nonfree-blobs-firmware-linux-nonfree/7251 non-freedom software project philosophy discussion]

Rationale for this Policy:

* Avoiding endless, circular, non-productive debates.
* Clearly defining project philosophy.
* [[Avoid_nonfreedom_software|Avoid Non-Freedom Software]]
* [[Reporting_Bugs#Community_Feedback|Community Feedback Policy]]
* Brand protection. The {{project name}} project is known to be a Freedom Software project that routes all communications over the [[Tor]] network. Not diluting this brand for being bundled with unnecessary non-freedom software components.
