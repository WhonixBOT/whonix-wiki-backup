__FORCETOC__

= Introduction = 

The {{project name}} project is a Freedom Software project.

{{project_name}} is not a Freedom Software maximalist project, since it does not adhere to the [https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.en.html Free System Distribution Guidelines (GNU FSDG)] ([https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-and-free-system-distribution-guidelines-gnu-fsdg/5877 forum discussion]). However, {{project_name}} will not bundle any unnecessary, major non-freedom software software components or contribute to these.

! scope="row"| Policy Rationale 
| This policy has been devised for the following reasons:
* Avoiding endless, circular and non-productive debates.
* Clearly defining the {{project_name}} project philosophy.
* [[Avoid_nonfreedom_software|Avoiding Non-Freedom Software]]
* [[Reporting_Bugs#Community_Feedback|Community Feedback Policy]]
* Brand protection - the {{project name}} project is known to be a Freedom Software project that routes all communications over the [[Tor]] network. It is undesirable to harm this brand by bundling it with unnecessary non-freedom software components.
