{{project name}} Policy On Non-Freedom Software
}}

'''DRAFT!'''

The {{project name}} is a Freedom Software project.

Permitted:

* Helping users asking about non-freedom software.
** Example. Question: "How to use Wickr?" Answer: "See wiki page [[Wickr]]." - Permitted.
* Documentation on non-freedom software such as [[VMware]].

Prohibited:

* Unsolicited recommendations of non-freedom applications.
** Example. Question: "How to use remote support?" Answer "use anydesk". - Prohibited.

Contributions to Non-Freedom Software:

* Examples:
** Non-freedom software hypervisors such as VMware <ref>
https://forums.whonix.org/t/vmware-maintainer/9239
</ref> and Hyper-V.
* Must be hosted unrelated to the {{project name}} [[Whonix_Trademark_Policy|trademark]] and website.

Rationale for this Policy:

* [[Avoid_nonfreedom_software|Avoid Non-Freedom Software]]
* [[Reporting_Bugs#Community_Feedback|Community Feedback Policy]]
* Brand protection. The {{project name}} project is known to be a Freedom Software project that routes all communications over the [[Tor]] network. Not diluting this brand for being bundled with unnecessary non-freedom software components.
