= Whonix does not start? =

== PAE crash ==

If Whonix does not start because PAE is missing: Right Click on Whonix-Gateway -> Settings -> Processor -> Disable the ''Enable PAE/NX'' Box -> OK.

Repeat that for Whonix-Workstation as well.

Read the [[#Boot Options|Boot Options]] chapter and use the 486 kernel.

== Other reasons ==

Please have a look at the [[Download]] page. It contains instructions on how to properly download and verify the Whonix virtual machine images. There is also help available in form of screenshot or video instructions.

If you still need help, please go to the [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/ User Help Forum].

= Boot Options =

In the grub boot menu you can choose for two seconds. Two kernels are installed by default.

* The default 686-pae kernel.
* A 486 kernel for compatibility.

'''If Whonix works out of the box, you do not need to change anything''' and you can stick to the default 686-pae kernel.

In case you need to [[#PAE_crash|disable PAE]], use the 486 kernel.
