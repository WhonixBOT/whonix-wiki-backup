* Suggest a business model.
* Scope of investment.
* Desired influence.
* Profit sharing model.
* Throwing money at Whonix and expecting it back with interest earned is currently not possible since Whonix is not a scalable business operation that only needs capital in order to increase profits.
* Bringing monetary investments as well as at the same time non-monetary resources (any of hardware designers, programmers, usability designers, business developers, marketers and/or production capabilities) to the table, chances exponentially increase, that a cooperation will be possible.
