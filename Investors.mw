* Outline the scope and projected time-frame for the investment.
* Articulate the level of influence you wish to exert following your investment.
* If appropriate, describe the profit sharing model that will apply.

* The likelihood of a successful collaboration rises exponentially if monetary resources are associated with additional resources, such as one or more of the following:
** Programmers.
** Usability designers.
** Business developers.
** Hardware designers.
** Marketers and/or production capabilities.
