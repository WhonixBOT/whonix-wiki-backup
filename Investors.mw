'''Interested in becoming an investor? Please get in [[Contact]]!'''

At a minimum, potential investors need to consider the following factors before entering into any arrangements with the Whonix Project: 

* First develop and suggest an appropriate business model as an investment partner.
* Outline the scope and projected time-frame for the investment.
* Articulate the level of influence you wish to exert following your investment.
* If appropriate, describe the profit sharing model that will apply.
* Be aware that the Whonix business structure means significant capital injections will not necessarily scale to a commensurate rise in profits.
* The likelihood of a successful collaboration rises exponentially if monetary resources are associated with additional resources, such as:
** Hardware designers.
** Programmers.
** Usability designers.
** Business developers.
** Marketers and/or production capabilities.
