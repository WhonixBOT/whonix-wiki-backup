UNFINISHED!

Most times when talking generally about opening ports (clearnet, unrelated to Tor), technically one is referring to allow unsolicited incoming connections. Imagine a public web server. The websever is supposed to be able to reply to unsolicited incoming connections by clients. On the other hand however, clients usually (except when they are behind some corporate, national or similar firewall) can use any outgoing port. When a client is creating an outgoing connection, the operating system picks a random port where it expects the solicited incoming answer. Sometimes end users want to open a port such for example when they want to install a public webserver on their home connection. The end users have mostly unrestricted outgoing access, but unsolicited incoming connections are restricted by their home router's NAT firewall. Opening a port for them often means that they use their router's web interface, configure the port they want to open and forward it to a computer in their LAN network. Also when they are using a firewall that restricts unsolicited incoming connections, they need to open an incoming port in their firewall in order to make their server application reachable from the open internet.

When talking about [[Tor]], the topic of opening ports often causes confusion. By default Tor works only as a client, which means it lets the user establish outgoing connections<ref>TCP and some types of DNS</ref> and and receives the solicited answers. The Tor software by default does not block any outgoing ports. However, some Tor exit relays restrict outgoing ports. In theory, if there was no Tor exit relay supporting outgoing port 22, then you could not exit the Tor network directly through that port. In these cases there would be no way to force open that port since that is a Tor relay, not Tor client setting.

[[Hosting Location Hidden Services|Hosting Location Hidden Services]] over Tor is possible. One way to accomplish this is using [[Hidden Services]].

As of Whonix 13, it makes limited sense to open a port. There are very few exceptions.

* [[Access_Gateway_Port_From_Host|Access Gateway Port From Host]]
* In past, using the now deprecated censorship circumvention Tor pluggable transport [[Deprecated#flashproxy|flashproxy]] required opening
* [[Hosting a %28private%29 %28obfuscated%29 bridge or %28exit%29 relay|Hosting a (private) (obfuscated) bridge or (exit) relay]] 
<br />
In Whonix 14 (in development), if you want to host a Tor hidden service,  you will need to open a port in Whonix-Workstation firewall so Whonix-Gateway can forward the incoming Tor hidden service connection to Whonix-Workstation. This will be covered in [[Hidden Services]] instructions.
