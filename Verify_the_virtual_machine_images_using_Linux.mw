|description=Instructions for OpenPGP Verification of Whonix using Linux
}}

You need to have the ''kgpg'' package installed. If you're not sure or want to install it, under Debian, Ubuntu or Whonix you can issue the following commands:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install kgpg
}}

First, download the [[Whonix Signing Key]].

Open {{Code|patrick.asc}} with kgpg.

You will get notified will the following message:

(E-mail was changed to adrelanos at riseup do net, but this doesn't change anything, since the key fingerprint remains the same.)

[[Image:kgpg_key_imported_new.png]]

Or if you previously already imported the key:

[[Image:kgpg_key_imported_unchanged.png]]

Now, '''download the cryptographic signature''' corresponding to the virtual machine image ({{Code2|.ova}}) you want to verify '''and store it in the same folder as the virtual machine image''':

Download Whonix Signature: [[VirtualBox#Whonix_signature|VirtualBox]] | [[KVM#Whonix_signature|KVM]]

Start kgpg, go to kgpg -> File -> Open Editor -> Signature -> Verify Signature... -> Choose the downloaded cryptographic signature ({{Code2|.asc}}).

It will '''take a while''' and there is '''no progress meter'''. Please wait a few moments.

'''If the virtual machine image is correct''' you will get a notification telling you that the signature is good:

(E-mail was changed to adrelanos at riseup do net, but this doesn't change anything, since the key fingerprint remains the same.)

{{gpg_signature_timestamp}}

The first line includes the signature creation timestamp.

Click on {{Code2|Details}}. See example below. 

{{CodeSelect|code=
[GNUPG:] VALIDSIG 6E979B28A6F37C43BE30AFA1CB8D50BB77BB3C48 2015-01-19
}}

{{GnuPG_file_names}}

To help you check, that the file name has not been tampered with, beginning from Whonix version 9.6 and above, by convention, the file@name OpenPGP notation includes the file name.

Click on {{Code2|Details}}. See example below. 

{{CodeSelect|code=
NOTATION_NAME file@name [GNUPG:] NOTATION_DATA Whonix-Gateway-9.6.ova
}}

'''If the virtual machine image is not correct''' you will get a notification telling you that the signature is bad:

(E-mail was changed to adrelanos at riseup do net, but this doesn't change anything, since the key fingerprint remains the same.)
