{{title|title=
Multiple Boot Modes for Better Security - an Implementation of Untrusted Root
}}
{{forkme}}

This concept is generic. Works for both, hosts and VMs. Both, Whonix and non-Whonix ([[Kicksecure]]).

= Goals =
* [[Login spoofing|defeat login spoofing]]
* [[Root#Prevent_Malware_from_Sniffing_the_Root_Password|Prevent Malware from Sniffing the Root Password]]
* [[Dev/Strong_Linux_User_Account_Isolation|Strong Linux User Account Isolation]]

= Grub Default Boot Menu Entries =

* <code>PERSISTENT mode USER (For daily activities.)</code>
* <code>LIVE mode USER (For daily activities.)</code>
* <code>PERSISTENT mode SECUREADMIN (For software installation.)</code>
* <code>PERSISTENT mode SUPERADMIN (Be very cautious!)</code>
* <code>Recovery PERSISTENT mode SUPERADMIN (Be very cautious!)</code>

= boot modes considered too unimportant to be added to grub default boot menu =

* <code>LIVE mode SECUREADMIN</code>
* <code>LIVE mode SUPERADMIN</code>
* <code>Recovery LIVE mode SUPERADMIN</code>

I don’t see good use cases for these. But could be convinced otherwise with user feedback.

If anyone cares about these, there could be files in <code>/etc/grub.d/</code> folder that add such entries but these files could be non-executable by default. Thereby <code>update-grub</code> would ignore them. To opt-in into such modes, users could just run <code>sudo chmod +x /etc/grub.d/somenumber_name-of-boot-mode</code>.

Also users who really want something special/custom would be able to add whatever they want to <code>/etc/grub.d/</code> folder / grub boot menu.

Also by using grub boot menu editing (key <code>e</code>) at grub boot menu, kernel parameters can be adjusted and any combination would be possible.

= Use Cases for the Different Boot Modes =

* <code>PERSISTENT mode USER (For daily activities.)</code>: Useful for browsing, e-mail, chat, etc. or just letting an already set up and installed server run. Even upgrading through <code>upgrade-nonroot</code>.
* <code>LIVE mode USER (For daily activities.)</code>: Same as above but without persistence.
* <code>PERSISTENT mode SECUREADMIN (For software installation.)</code>: users could run <code>sudo apt install whatever-software-package</code>, then reboot into USER. Editing <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d</code> [https://github.com/Whonix/apparmor-profile-everything/blob/master/etc/apparmor.d/abstractions/dangerous-files among many other things] prohibited for better security.
* <code>PERSISTENT mode SUPERADMIN (Be very cautious!)</code>: users could add foreign sources to <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d</code> or do anything (full freedom), then (optional but advisable) reboot to SECUREADMIN mode, install packages from third party repositories.
* <code>Recovery PERSISTENT mode SUPERADMIN (Be very cautious!)</code>: The usual recovery mode.

= opt-out to get same behavior as old Whonix =

Users who don’t like (any, multiple or all) of the new options...

* <code>PERSISTENT mode USER (For daily activities.)</code> [A]
* <code>LIVE mode USER (For daily activities.)</code> [B]
* <code>PERSISTENT mode SECUREADMIN (For software installation.)</code> [C]

and who want "the old Whonix" "with unrestricted sudo" (<code>PERSISTENT mode SUPERADMIN</code>) back, who don't want to see any of the new options [A], [B], [C]... These could just make these <code>/etc/grub.d</code> folder / grub menu entries gone by running <code>sudo chmod -x /etc/grub.d/somenumber_name-of-boot-mode</code>. (There could be a script to simplify that.)

= /etc/grub.d file names =
<pre>
filename                                     purpose
</pre>

<pre>
/etc/grub.d/10_linux                         PERSISTENT mode USER
/etc/grub.d/11_linux_live                    LIVE mode USER
/etc/grub.d/12_linux_secureadmin             PERSISTENT mode SECUREADMIN
/etc/grub.d/13_linux_secureadmin_live        LIVE mode SECUREADMIN
/etc/grub.d/14_linux_superadmin              PERSISTENT mode SUPERADMIN
/etc/grub.d/15_linux_superadmin_live         LIVE mode SUPERADMIN
/etc/grub.d/16_linux_recovery_mode           PERSISTENT mode SUPERADMIN
/etc/grub.d/17_linux_recovery_mode_live      Recovery LIVE mode SUPERADMIN
</pre>

Should stay in lexical order below files named <code>/etc/grub.d/20_</code> because that is already used by an existing script.

Note: some files will not be created in the first iteration (and not sure ever) - those listed in chapter <code>Boot modes considered too unimportant to be added to grub default boot menu:</code> in my post above.

= Terminology =
* <code>secure admin mode</code> vs user <code>secureadmin</code> vs <code>secureroot</code>: When booting into <code>secure admin mode</code>, the user will be logged in as user <code>secureadmin</code>. In <code>secureadmin mode</code>, when running <code>sudo something</code> the command will effectively run as <code>secureroot</code> (untrusted root).
* <code>super admin mode</code> vs user <code>super admin</code> vs <code>superroot</code>: When booting into <code>super admin mode</code>, the user will be logged in as user <code>superadmin</code>. In <code>super admin mode</code>, when running <code>sudo something</code> the command will effectively run as <code>superroot</code> (unrestricted root).
* <code>untrusted root</code>: A command running as <code>root</code> but with restrictions applied by apparmor-profile-everything.
* <code>unrestricted root</code>: When running <code>sudo something</code>, the behavior will be the same as on most Linux distributions such as Debian where <code>root</code> can do everything that <code>root</code> can usually do on such Linux distributions.

= Capabilities of secureroot vs superroot =
<code>secureroot</code> will be untrusted root, therefore restricted but can still:

* install packages
* change most system settings

<code>secureroot</code> cannot by design:

* change anything that could lead to <code>superroot</code>
* change the running kernel
* replace bootloader (only if APT does this due to an upgrade)
* uninstall certain packages required to enforce the separation of <code>secureroot</code> and <code>superroot</code> such as for example apparmor-profile-apparmor

<code>superroot</code> by design will be able to do everything.

= Server Support =
grub boot menu isn’t easily accessible for many/most servers. How would these various boot modes be available for servers? No solution yet.
