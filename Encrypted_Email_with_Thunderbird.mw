Minor editorial changes have been made to the source material, along with additional [[{{q_project_name_short}}|{{q_project_name}}]] steps and wiki / external references where appropriate.

= Introduction =

Due to the complexity of software in the past, one of the most underutilized forms of protection for users is email encryption. However, it is now easier to take advantage of encrypted email via the use of Thunderbird (Mozilla's email client) and Enigmail, which is a graphical front-end for using the GnuPG ("GPG") encryption program. Unfortunately, the TorBirdy extension is no longer available to make Thunderbird connections take place over the Tor network. <ref>https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/torbirdy</ref> This necessitates a number of manual preference changes in Thunderbird to use email safely.

{{PQCrypto}}

Encrypted subject and references headers are also now possible in Enigmail, reducing the leakage of metadata. <ref>https://blog.torproject.org/our-latest-release-torbirdy-thunderbird-includes-new-enigmail-features</ref> <ref>https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/21880</ref> However, MIME is not used in these instructions to reduce the risk of Enigmail bugs exposing unencrypted messages, meaning the subject line will ''not'' be encrypted. On the upside, this configuration change allows the user to confirm their message is actually encrypted before it is sent.

The following guide provides a higher security and privacy standard than relying upon online services such as ProtonMail or Lavabit, that promise "encrypted email" in transit or storage. Online systems can still be broken by an attacker capable of exploiting JavaScript flaws or undermining certificate authorities that provide encryption certificates for websites; see [[E-Mail#Webmail|Webmail]]. Further, online providers can be hacked or coerced by adversaries to provide access for extended periods.

To minimize these risks and improve security, the following guide uses a suitable [[E-Mail#Email_Clients|Desktop Email Client]] instead of webmail, paired with strong, end-to-end encryption that protects the contents so it can only be read by the intended recipient. Further, a strong encryption key-pair is created so the user has strict control over the private key, which is stored securely. Keep in mind this method does not make email infallible -- advanced adversaries can easily penetrate Internet-facing endpoints of targets with today's cutting-edge surveillance and offensive systems. Also, mistakes or poor security practices on behalf of the email recipient can inadvertently lead to disclosures of plaintext.

{{mbox
| type      = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = '''Tip:''' If possible, critical information that is of high value should not traverse computer networks at all, or even risk exposure to Internet-facing computers.  <ref>Similarly, that same information should not be stored on electronic media in the first place, if that is feasible in the circumstances.</ref> High-risk users might also consider combining the use of [[PQCrypto#OneTime|One Time Pads]] with email encryption for even greater security, and creating an [[Air_Gapped_OpenPGP_Key|airgapped OpenPGP key pair]] rather than relying on Enigmail as per these instructions.
}}

== Overview ==

The following guide provides steps to:
# Install the Thunderbird email client.
# Install the Enigmail add-on for Thunderbird.
# Due to the unavailability of the TorBirdy plugin, configure Thunderbird preferences for safe use of email.
# Create an email account anonymously with a suitable provider via Tor Browser.
# Store the login credentials in [https://packages.debian.org/buster/keepassxc KeePassXC] (optional). <ref>Installed by default in {{project_name}} 15.</ref>
# Setup the new email account: Thunderbird account settings, install necessary extensions (add-ons), and enforce connections to the email provider's Onion Service.
# Create an OpenPGP encryption key pair and revocation certificate using the Enigmail Setup Wizard.
# Encrypt and store the revocation certificate securely.
# Configure Thunderbird preferences for greater security and anonymity.
# Configure additional OpenPGP preferences via Enigmail.
# Key management: import GPG public keys.
# Export the public key to a GPG key server (optional).
# Prepare an email signature with the public GPG key ID and fingerprint (optional).
# Compose and send a test encrypted email to danwin1210.me
# Open an encrypted email received in Thunderbird.

== Warnings ==

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text    = Due to email's design, it is a very insecure system where privacy and anonymity are concerned. Use it sparingly, and only with great discipline and caution. 
}}

Operational security is imperative to maintain the integrity of properly encrypted email. Consider the following scenarios which would allow an adversary access to the plaintext or other metadata that might help deanonymize a user:

* Even if all email sent to a recipient is encrypted, if the recipient fails to encrypt the email response, then adversaries will be able to read the message and likely a quote of the original one sent.
* The names of email recipients cannot be encrypted and are therefore visible to adversaries. The subject line and references email header will also be visible in the following configuration.
* There are several different types of [https://easycrypt.co/email-privacy-crash-course-part-3-metadata-and-anonymity/ metadata] that can be harvested from email, depending on how it is used. Therefore, users must be careful when relying on email for sensitive communications.

= Create a New Email Account with Tor Browser =

== Choose an Appropriate Email Provider ==

First and foremost, there are multiple email providers that users can choose from. For the purpose of this tutorial, danwin1210.me is used as an example. This is not an endorsement for danwin1210.me, nor are they necessarily the most secure or private email provider available. Refer to the list of [[E-Mail#Onion_Service_Providers|Onion Service Providers]] for possible alternatives.

At the time of writing, danwin1210.me is one of the few free and reliable email providers offering POP3 email access through an .onion address, which does not require additional verification details to register an account. You will have 25MB of disk space available for your emails. For more details regarding the features and offerings of danwin1210.me, visit http://danielas3rtn54uwmofdo3x2bsdifr47huasnmbgqzfrec5ubupvtpid.onion/mail/index.php. If used properly with GPG encryption, this onion email service will provide the user with strong anonymity and privacy. 

If problems are experienced with danwin1210.me, refer to the [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/EmailProvider list of providers] recommended by The Tor Project, [[E-Mail#Email_Provider_Comparison|{{project_name}}]] and [https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/help/email-provider.html JonDonym].

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text    = Never forget this is an [[Onion_Services#How_Onion_Services_Connections_Work|Onion Service]] which means there is no way of  determining who is running it. If GPG is not used to encrypt email and/or the recipient of email does not encrypt it either, <u>it can be easily read by the email service provider, random computers on the internet that relay a sent email message, or anyone else who manages to gain access to the account!</u>
}}

== Anonymous Registration ==

It is critical to create a new email account anonymously with Tor Browser. In {{workstation_product_name}} ([[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]]: <code>anon-whonix</code>), launch Tor Browser via the icon on the toolbar ([[{{non_q_project_name_short}}|{{non_q_project_name}}]]) or via the Qube Manager (or widget).

When Tor Browser opens, type.

{{CodeSelect|code=

= Create an OpenPGP Key Pair and Revocation Certificate =

There are two methods for creating an OpenPGP key pair and revocation certificate -- using either the Enigmail Setup Wizard, or manually creating them from the command line. The easier Enigmail method is outlined below, but the [[Air_Gapped_OpenPGP_Key|manual creation of stronger keys from the command line]] is recommended for advanced users or those at high risk.

== Launch Enigmail Setup Wizard ==

To start the Enigmail Setup Wizard, after returning to the main Thunderbird window, click the "hamburger" icon that has the 3 horizontal bars towards the upper right corner. 

Then, hover the mouse over "Preferences" and click "Menu Bar" when the next menu appears.

'''Figure:''' ''Menu Bar''

[[File:Tempest_screenshot_41.png]]

A menu bar will now appear towards the top of the Thunderbird window. In the menu bar, click "Enigmail" and then click "Setup Wizard."

'''Figure:''' ''Enigmail Setup Wizard''

[[File:Tempest_screenshot_42.png]]

You will now be brought to the Enigmail Setup Wizard. Select "Start setup now" and then click on the "Next" button.

'''Figure:''' Start Enigmail Set Up

[[File:Tempestupdate14.png]]

== Create an OpenPGP Key Pair ==
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Access Enigmail's extended configuration options.

After the Enigmail Setup Wizard starts, on the next screen click the circle next to "I prefer an extended configuration" and then click the "Next" button.

'''Figure:''' ''Extended Enigmail Configuration''

[[File:Tempestupdate15.png]]

'''2.''' Create a new key pair.

Next, a prompt will appear to either create a GPG keypair or use an existing one. 

Click the circle next to "I want to create a new key pair for signing and encrypting my email" and then click the "Next" button.

'''Figure:''' ''Create a New Key Pair''

[[File:Tempestupdate16.png]]

'''3.''' Create a strong passphrase for the key pair.

In the next window that appears, a prompt will appear to create a passphrase for the GPG private key. 

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text    = This passphrase should be  [[Passwords#Content_and_Length|long]] and  [[Passwords#Generating_Unbreakable_Passwords|random]]! You will need this passphrase to sign messages with GPG or to decrypt messages sent to you.
}}

With a strong passphrase, if the machine is ever compromised and someone steals the GPG secret key, this provides an extra layer of protection to prevent the attacker from being able to easily decrypt emails sent to you, or to impersonate you by signing emails with the GPG key.

* Type an appropriately secure and random passphrase into the fields under "Passphrase" and "Please confirm your passphrase by typing it again." 
* Then, click on the "Next" button. 
* Optionally create a new entry in KeePassXC to store the GPG passphrase and manually enter the passphrase into the new entry. Then, save the KeePassXC database. This will be useful if the GPG passphrase is forgotten. <ref>This is optional because some users may not place trust in the integrity of KeePassXC or other password managers, and they remain an attractive target for hackers.</ref>

'''Figure:''' ''New Key Pair Dialog''

[[File:Tempestupdate17.png]]

'''4.''' Wait for the key pair creation process to finish.

A window will appear that shows the progress of your key creation. Move your mouse or browse the web in order to speed up the process if needed.

'''2.''' Enter the passphrase.

A prompt will now appear to enter the passphrase created in the last step. Paste the GPG passphrase from KeePassXC (or enter it manually) into the "Passphrase" field and click the "OK" button.

'''Figure:''' ''Enter the GPG Passphrase''

[[File:Tempestupdate22.png]]

'''3.''' Choose the location for the revocation certificate.

The next window will ask where the GPG revocation certificate should be stored.

Click on "Home" in the left column. Next, replace the spaces and parentheses signs with periods in the default filename for the GPG revocation certificate. The spaces and parentheses signs in the default name can make a step later in this guide trickier. Finally, click the "Save" button.

'''Figure:''' ''Store the Revocation Certificate''

[[File:Tempestupdate23.png]]

'''4.''' Confirm the certificate was created.

Next, a message will inform that the GPG revocation certificate was successfully created. Click the "OK" button.

}}

== Encrypt the Revocation Certificate ==

The revocation certificate will now be encrypted and stored in the persistent storage directory. The GPG revocation certificate can be used to revoke the public encryption key that is added to key servers, even if access to the GPG secret key is lost or the password is forgotten.

If an attacker accesses the GPG revocation certificate, they can revoke the keys. Encrypting the GPG revocation certificate with a passphrase that is easily remembered will protect against this action. 

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Open up a Konsole / Terminal session to get a command prompt. 

* <u>{{non_q_project_name_short}}</u>: <code>Click the "K" start button</code> &rarr; <code>Click "Terminal"</code>

'''3.''' Encrypt the revocation certificate.

In the command below, replace "RevocationCertificateFileName" with the actual name of the revocation certificate. Type.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --cipher-algo AES256 --symmetric RevocationCertificateFileName
}}

A prompt will appear to "Enter passphrase." Choose a strong passphrase and enter it into the passphrase field, then click the "OK" button. Also consider creating a new entry in KeePassXC to store the GPG revocation certificate passphrase (manually enter the passphrase into the new entry, then save the KeePassXC database). <ref>This will be useful in case the passphrase is ever forgotten.</ref>

'''Figure:''' ''Passphrase Prompt''

[[File:Tempestupdate29.png]]

A prompt will appear, asking for the passphrase to be re-entered. Type it again into the passphrase field and click the "OK" button.

}}

Note: If an error appears that states.

<pre>gpg: error creating passphrase: invalid passphrase</pre>

Then a typo was made somewhere in the last two steps - start over from the beginning of this section.

'''4.''' Move the revocation certificate.

If no error messages appear and the user is returned to the command prompt, type.

{{CodeSelect|code=
mv *.gpg storage/gpg-revoke
}}

And press <code>Enter</code>.

'''5.''' Test decryption of the revocation key. 

In the future, if the revocation key is ever needed, decrypt it by typing.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg -o RevocationCertificateFilename.asc -d \~/storage/gpg-revoke/RevocationCertificateFilename.gpg
}}

'''6.''' Shred the unencrypted revocation certificate that is sitting in the home folder.

In the Key Management window that opens, your key is in bold. Click on <code>Keyserver</code> &rarr; <code>Search for Keys</code>

'''Figure:''' ''Key Search''

[[File:Tempestupdate42.png]]

The next window that appears enables a search for GPG keys hosted on public GPG key servers. It is possible to search for GPG keys by email address, a short key ID or an individual's public GPG fingerprint. 

This step starts a search for the key belong to anonguide@danwin1210.me based on its public GPG fingerprint. Paste.

{{CodeSelect|code=
81934E7B83E89CFD8C25F3D67FBD040886EC5FE0
}}

In the field next to "Search for key" and click the "OK" button.

'''Figure:''' ''Fingerprint Key Search''

The results are more secure and work more often. Everyone who shares a public GPG key should share a long fingerprint.
}}

'''3.''' Import the desired key(s).

In the next window that appears, an entry for "anonguide@vfemail.net" with a Key ID starting
with "81934E7B" should be displayed with a check mark next to it. Click the "OK" button to import the key.

'''Figure:''' ''Key Importation''

[[File:Tempestupdate44.png]]

A window should appear stating that the key for "anonguide@danwin1210.me" was successfully imported. 

When importing the key, it is not a problem that the email address is different from the "anonguide@vfemail.net" one listed above. Multiple email addresses can be used with a GPG public key. 

"Anonguide@vfemail.net" is simply an older email address associated with the key. The important aspect to note is the fingerprint, which should appear as:

<pre>
8193 4E7B 83E8 9CFD 8C25
F3D6 7FBD 0408 86EC 5FE0</pre>

Click the "OK" button to continue.

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = If the fingerprint is different than what is shown above, delete the key for the "anonguide" email address in the key manager and start over from the beginning of this section.

| text    = '''Important:''' It is critical to verify any GPG public key that is added to the keyring with a fingerprint provided by the person you intend to communicate with.
}}
}}

Always remember that anyone can add a GPG public key to a key server and claim to belong to a certain email account. Consider the following attack vector:

# An attacker is monitoring an email account through surveillance.
# An encryption key is mistakenly used that was created to falsely correspond to the intended recipient of communications. 
# The attacker is now able to read the user's email.

== Add User ID to Key Properties ==

In this section an additional account is added to your GPG key. This is necessary due to the fact that the "danwin1210.me" email service also allows emails to be sent to and from its .onion domain, which is a good feature. Therefore, these steps add your email address with the .onion domain to the same GPG key. This makes it easier for software used by others to automatically select your GPG public key when sending an email to one of your addresses.

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Open the "Key Properties" window.

Double-click on the key entry for the danwin1210.me email address to open the "Key Properties" window.

'''Figure:''' ''Select your Key''

[[File:Tempestupdate46.png]]

'''2.''' Select the "Manage User IDs" option.

When the "Key Properties" window opens, click on the pull down menu entitled "Select action" and then click on "Manage User IDs."

'''Figure:''' ''User ID Management''

[[File:Tempestupdate47.png]]

'''3.''' Add a User ID.

In the next window that appears, click the "Add" button.

'''Figure:''' ''Add User ID''

[[File:Tempestupdate48.png]]

'''4.''' Complete the User ID fields.

* In the field next to "Name," use the same name you chose when setting up the email account.
* Next to the "email" field, add the username you chose followed by "@tt3j2x4k5ycaa5zt.onion" 
* In the example below, replace "youranonemail" with your user name. 
* Type youranonemail@tt3j2x4k5ycaa5zt.onion in the field next to "Email." Then, click the "OK" button.

'''Figure:''' ''User ID Fields''

[[File:Tempestupdate49.png]]

'''5.''' Enter the GPG passphrase.

A prompt will appear to enter the GPG passphrase. Either copy and paste the GPG passphrase from
KeePassXC, or manually enter it then click the "OK" button.

'''Figure:''' ''GPG Passphrase Prompt''

[[File:Tempestupdate50.png]]

The next window should inform that the User ID was added successfully. Click the "Close"
button.

== Import Public Keys from Websites ==

On occasion, the GPG public key of an intended email recipient is not located on a key server, but a public key block is hosted on a website.

To import these keys into Thunderbird:

# Copy the public key from the website to the clipboard.
# Navigate to the Enigmail key management program: <code>Enigmail</code> &rarr; <code>Key Management</code>
# Import the keys: <code>Edit</code> &rarr; <code>Import Keys from Clipboard</code>

== Alternative Key Server Methods ==

There are two alternatives for interacting with key servers:

* <u>[[Software#KGpg|KGpg]]</u>: To fetch contacts' GPG keys from the key server, open KGpg and navigate to ''Key Server Dialog''. Search for relevant email addresses and import the keys.
* <u>GPG command line</u>: Searching, fetching and importing keys from key servers from [http://www.linuxguide.it/command_line/linux-manpage/do.php?file=gpg the command line] is relatively simple.

<u>Note</u>: Previously, Enigmail's keyserver interaction features did not work out of the box. <ref>
[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/torbirdy#EnigmailOpenPGPGPGforThunderbird As it has been made fail closed by TorBirdy developers], otherwise there could be a DNS leak in setups not using {{project_name}}.
</ref> <ref>A previous proposal on how to make keyservers in Enigmail in {{project name}} work out of the box: [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/17533 do not use keyserver-options in {{project_name}}]
</ref> With these instructions, it should no longer be necessary to apply manual settings following a restart of Thunderbird in order to interact with key servers. <ref>Upstream bug report: [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/13430 Can't set custom http-proxy on GnuPG-settings, lost after restart].</ref> <ref>There is no need for this setting in {{project name}} since Enigmail calls GPG, everything is already torified, and gpg is [[Stream Isolation|stream isolated]] by a uwt wrapper.</ref> <ref> Forum discussion: https://forums.whonix.org/t/gpg-keyservers-from-within-whonix-workstation </ref> <ref>Previous instructions: <code>Thunderbird</code> &rarr; <code>Enigmail (from menu bar)</code> &rarr; <code>Preferences</code> &rarr; <code>Display Expert Settings and Menus</code> &rarr; <code>Advanced</code> &rarr; <code>Additional Parameters</code> &rarr; remove the following part <code>--keyserver-options http-proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8118</code> &rarr; <code>OK</code></ref>

== Export the Public Key to a GPG Server ==

{{Box|text=

'''1.''' Copy the GPG key fingerprint.

This is necessary to check the key is successfully exported at a later step and to set up a GPG key signature block. Use the mouse to highlight the text next to "Fingerprint." Then, right-click the highlighted text and click "copy."

'''Figure:''' ''GPG Key Fingerprint''

[[File:Tempestupdate55.png]]

After copying the GPG fingerprint, click the "Close" button.

'''Figure:''' ''Key Properties Window Closure''

[[File:Tempestupdate56.png]]

'''2.''' Select the key to be uploaded.

Right-click on the entry for the email address and click "Upload Public Keys to Keyserver."

'''Figure:''' ''Upload Public Keys''

[[File:Tempestupdate57.png]]

A progress meter will then appear. If the upload is successful, ''no'' confirmation message will be received. 

'''Figure:''' ''Upload Progress Meter''

[[File:Tempestupdate58.png]]

'''3.''' Confirm the key was successfully uploaded.

To check that the GPG public key was successfully exported to the keyserver, do a search for your own key the same way you searched for the key belonging to "anonguide@danwin1210.me" in an earlier step.

Simply paste the public GPG fingerprint into the search field and remove the spaces between the letters and numbers.

'''4.''' Close the Enigmail Key Management window. 

Click the "X" in the upper right corner of the window.
}}

== Public GPG Key Signature Block ==

The following steps configure Thunderbird to inform people about the public GPG key by embedding it in the email signature.

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Navigate to account settings.

After returning to the main Thunderbird window, click on <code>Edit</code> &rarr; <code>Account Settings</code>

'''Figure:''' ''Further Account Settings''

[[File:Tempestupdate59.png]]

'''2.''' Create an email PGP signature block.

A signature is now created that will be included in all outgoing mail, which contains both the GPG public key ID and the GPG public key fingerprint. In the next window that appears:

* Click in the text field located underneath "Signature text."
* Paste the contents of the clipboard on to two separate lines in the text field.
* On the first line:
** Type "GPG Public Key:" before the fingerprint that was just pasted. 
** Delete all but the last 16 characters of the fingerprint from this line. <ref>In the example below, the fingerprint consists of 10 groups of 4 characters. Delete the first six groups, then delete the spaces in between the remaining groups of characters.</ref>
** Type "0x" (that is the numeral zero) directly in front of the remaining characters. <ref>In the example below, that results in <code>0x1C593D788F0E5176.</code> The end result of what is created here is the GPG public key ID. People can enter that into various GPG key servers to find the public key and send you encrypted messages.</ref>
* On the second line, type "Fingerprint:" in front of the characters pasted there. This will help enable people who download the GPG public key to verify that it is they key you wish them to use. When finished, click the "OK" button.

'''Figure:''' ''PGP Email Signature Block''

= Compose and Send Encrypted Email =

The first section will test the correct sending of the first encrypted email to anonguide@danwin1210.me with Enigmail. 

The second section outlines using [[Software#KGpg|KGpg]] instead of Enigmail. This is for users who require a higher level of security for importing private keys and creating ciphertext which can be sent via Thunderbird. <ref>Avoiding Enigmail bypasses any unexpected behavior with message encryption. For instance, in one case bugs in email clients and Enigmail lead to the auto-saving of drafts as plaintext.</ref> <ref>https://tails.boum.org/security/claws_mail_leaks_plaintext_to_imap/index.en.html</ref> <ref>http://sourceforge.net/p/enigmail/bugs/502</ref> <ref>Persons in critical situations may prefer to encrypt emails in such a way to mitigate the risk of leaks.</ref>

== Using Enigmail ==

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Compose a new email message.

Click the "Write" button located in the upper left region of the window.

'''Figure:''' ''Compose a New Email''

[[File:Tempestupdate61.png]]

A new window will open for you to compose an email message. 

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = Since the "danwin1210.me" email service is hosted on the .onion Tor server "tt3j2x4k5ycaa5zt.onion," you are going to send an email to the .onion domain. This keeps the transit of the email inside the Tor network, which is safer than transporting it in the clear. If an email provider of someone you want to send an email to uses a .onion domain, always use that domain in the "To" field if possible. 
}}

In the "To" field, type.

{{CodeSelect|code=
anonguide@tt3j2x4k5ycaa5zt.onion
}}

In the "Subject" field, type.

{{CodeSelect|code=
key test
}}

Next, type an innocuous message into the message body. Do not go into great detail; a large amount of text is unnecessary.

The point of this email is to test the encryption key and to become familiar with a common encrypted email exchange. Take note of the padlock and pencil icons located towards the upper-left side of the window next to the "Spelling" button. These icons should be marked as active with a green check mark, a gray square around them with the padlock closed, which means your message will be signed and encrypted (if you have a corresponding public key). To the far right of these icons, a status message also informs that the message will be signed and encrypted.

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text    = In this configuration, <u>the subject field is never encrypted</u>, even when the message and attachments are encrypted. Therefore, be wary of any information entered into in the subject field.
}}

'''2.''' Send the email message.

When the message is ready, click the "Send" button.

'''Figure:''' ''Send an Encrypted Email''

[[File:Tempestupdate62.png]]

You may next be prompted to enter the GPG passphrase (if this window does not appear, skip to the next step). This makes it possible for the message sent to be signed. When a message is signed, this provides a mechanism for the email recipient to be confident that the sender actually wrote the email, and not an impostor. Type the passphrase and click the "OK" button. 

'''Figure:''' ''GPG Passphrase Prompt''

[[File:Tempestupdate63.png]]

After typing in the passphrase, a confirmation window will appear asking if a signed and encrypted email should be sent to anonguide@tt3j2x4k5ycaa5zt.onion. Take note of the body of the email message under that window. This text should be clearly visible: 

<pre>-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----</pre>

Followed by a series of random characters. This proves the email has been encrypted and it is safe to click the "Send Message" button. However, if the original text of the message is visible, <u>then it is not encrypted and the "Cancel" button should be clicked.</u>

'''Figure:''' ''Email Encryption Confirmation''

[[File:Tempestupdate64.png]]

'''3.''' Enter the password for your email account.

A prompt will appear to enter the password for the danwin1210.me account. This will happen each time Thunderbird is started and the first email is sent, since the password is not stored by the program. However, once the password is entered, Thunderbird will remember it for the session. The same process applies to receiving email. 

When asked to enter the password, copy it from KeePassXC (or refer to your physical record), paste it into the password field and click the "OK" button.

'''Figure:''' ''Passphrase Prompt''

[[File:Tempestupdate65.png]]

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text    = Do not use Thunderbird's Password Manager to store the password! Thunderbird does not encrypt stored passwords by default. Thus, if an attacker compromises the machine and manages to access the Thunderbird folder, they will gain the password to the email account.
}}

After returning to the main Thunderbird window, a new "Sent" folder should appear in the Local Folders on the left side of the window, indicating the email to anonguide@danwin1210.me was sent.

'''Figure:''' ''Thunderbird Sent Folder''

[[File:Tempestupdate66.png]]
}}

== Using KGpg ==

# Open [[Software#KGpg|KGpg]] and select the recipient key. If selecting more than one key, press <code>CTRL</code> while clicking.
# Navigate to: <code>File</code> &rarr; <code>Open Editor</code>  and write the message.
# Encrypt the message to ciphertext by clicking on the ''Encrypt'' lock icon. Choose your private key in the prompt that appears and click <code>OK</code>.
# Copy the ciphertext into Thunderbird and send it as per normal procedures. Do not include subject lines since they are not encrypted.

= Download and Read Encrypted Email =

In the near future, you will want to check if anyone has sent email messages or if a response was received to the test email composed in the previous section. 

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Check for new email messages.

From the main Thunderbird window, click the "Get Messages" icon to check for any new email messages on the server and download them.

'''Figure:''' ''New Email Check''

[[File:Tempestupdate67.png]]

'''2.''' Enter the password.

A prompt will appear to enter the password for the email account. After entering the password, Thunderbird will remember it for the session. When asked to enter the password, type it into the password field (or copy and paste it from KeePassXC) and click the "OK" button.

'''Figure:''' ''Passphrase Prompt''

[[File:Tempestupdate68.png]]

'''3.''' Read new (encrypted) email messages.

When new emails are received, a counter will appear next to "Inbox" in the left column. Click on "Inbox" to go to the list of new emails, then click the email that you wish to read.

'''Figure:''' ''Thunderbird Inbox''

[[File:Tempestupdate69.png]]

If the message received was encrypted with your public key, the GPG passphrase is needed to decrypt it. If a window like the one in the image below appears, type the GPG passphrase and click the "OK" button.

'''Figure:''' ''GPG Passphrase Prompt''

[[File:Tempestupdate70.png]]

The email will now display in the lower portion of the Thunderbird window. From here, you have the option of replying, forwarding, deleting and so on. If a message is read that was sent from anonguide@tt3j2x4k5ycaa5zt.onion with an Enigmail message stating "Good signature from
AnonGuide <anonguide@tt3j2x4k5ycaa5zt.onion>," the encryption configuration is working correctly.

'''Figure:''' ''Successful Email Decryption''

[[File:Tempestupdate71.png]]
}}

= Final Warnings =

If all steps have been successfully completed then you now have an anonymous email account paired with strong encryption.

It should be emphasized this wiki entry is not a substitute for an all-inclusive tutorial on the safest way to use GPG/PGP encryption, however it provides a solid foundation for fundamental practices. Numerous advanced resources and expert opinions exist on the Internet, and these can provide additional tips that might better address a user's perceived threat model and circumstances. <ref>For instance, users at high risk might generate a strong [[Air_Gapped_OpenPGP_Key|airgapped OpenPGP key pair]] on the command line for greater security, rather than rely on Enigmail.</ref> At a minimum, it is recommended to review the [[E-Mail#Safe_Email_Principles|Safe Email Principles]] section, along with [[#Further_Reading|additional learning resources]].

Finally, always heed the following warnings regarding email:

* Email is a ''very insecure'' means of communication where anonymity is concerned. A lot of metadata is leaked with email, so it should be used sparingly and only when strictly necessary.
* Do not contact people you know in real life at non-anonymous email addresses with the email account that was created here. Always separate real world identities from online identities used with {{project_name}}.
* Be circumspect about sharing personal information in email! Encrypted email does not protect against the email recipient storing personal emails in an unencrypted format. Nor does encryption protect against an email recipient maliciously using personal information in order to exploit you.
* Never include sensitive information in an email subject line, <u>even if the email is encrypted!</u> Subject headers in email are not encrypted in this configuration, despite the fact the rest of the message is.
* If an email is sent to a recipient without encryption, assume it can be read by anyone!
* Utilize the Tor Onion Service (.onion domain) whenever it is made available by the email provider. After first confirming the domain is controlled by the email provider, it will afford greater protection than a clearnet address.
