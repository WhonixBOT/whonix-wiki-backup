= General Note about CI Services in use for Building {{project name}} =
Since all [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration Continuous Integration] (CI) services we know of run Ubuntu and {{project name}} is based on Debian, it was required to add a few CI specific workarounds to {{project name}} build script. Therefore, if a CI build works, that doesn't necessarily mean, that a Debian based build would succeed as well. So the usefulness of the results is a bit limited. Nevertheless, compatibility with CI environments is a very useful "stress test" for the build script. It helps early spotting most bugs, which break the build.

Since there are no free CI services supporting {{Code2|mount}} ({{Code2|device-mapper}}), there is unfortunately no CI service which could be used for building {{project name}} Virtual Machine images. Instead, we're CI's for simulating builds of {{project name}} Debian Packages as well as (minimal or full) {{Code2|--[[Dev/Build_Documentation/Physical_Isolation|install-to-root]]}} builds.

See also [[Dev/Build_Documentation/10_full#Warning|warning not to use images created inside Continuous Integration (CI) environments for anything besides testing]]!

= CI Services in Use =
== Travis CI ==
General:

* [https://travis-ci.org/{{project_name_short}}/{{project_name_short}} {{project name}} Travis]
* [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/{{project_name_short}}/blob/master/.travis.yml {{project name}} .travis.yml]
* [http://lint.travis-ci.org/{{project_name_short}}/{{project_name_short}} {{project name}} .travis.yaml validatior]
* We're using Travis CI to see if we can build Physically Isolated {{gateway_product_name}} or {{workstation_product_name}}.
* [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/{{project_name_short}}#build-status Status Badges]

Some more technical notes:

* Build time hard limit [http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/build-configuration/#Build-Timeouts 50 minutes]
* Build time inactivity limit [http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/build-configuration/#Build-Timeouts 10 minutes]
* Support says: The command and the URL to clone currently can't be influenced.
* These commands "$ rvm use default --install --binary --fuzzy ; $ ruby --version ; $ rvm --version ; $ gem --version" are not required. Support says: As for the commands listed, those can't be removed either, and they shouldn't add any significant load or time to your build.
* Support says: Regarding retaining storage, we have an APT caching service in the works, that's currently in testing. It won't be host-local, but it'll be network-local.
* Build failed log: https://api.travis-ci.org/jobs/12119447/log.txt?deansi=true - Failed due to missing device-mapper. No idea if possible to fix. - [https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/1493 Opened a ticket.]
* [https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/1494 very low entropy, gpg key creation takes very long]; [https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/1495 impossible to start haveged daemon]: workaround in place. <ref>If is CI detected... Linking {{Code|/dev/urandom}} to {{Code|/dev/random}}. In CI environment, there is usually very little entropy. Therefore gpg key creation takes very long. Since no images are deployed from CI systems, we can do this.</ref>
* If image creation is not possible, Travis CI could still be used to check if the whonix_build script works with --install-to-root switch.
* [https://www.evernote.com/shard/s32/sh/0dfcfbe1-b9a9-4f04-bcd4-6508ac4b0de0/8fa5f856cea80ed74aa824d47e3df031 stop a build button]

== drone.io ==
<!--* <html><img src="https://drone.io/github.com/{{project_name_short}}/{{project_name_short}}/status.png" alt="loading..."></html> -->
* Only building {{project name}} Debian Packages. No virtual machine images or physically isolated machines, because build timeout is too short. Only running.
