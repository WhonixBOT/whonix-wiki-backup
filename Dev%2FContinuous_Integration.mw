== Travis CI ==
* '''Not implemented yet! (Because Whonix is based on Debian, while Travis CI's system are Ubuntu based.)'''
* <html><img src="https://api.travis-ci.org/Whonix/Whonix.png?branch=travis" alt="loading..."></html>
* [https://travis-ci.org/Whonix/Whonix Whonix Travis]
* [http://lint.travis-ci.org/Whonix/Whonix Whonix .travis.yaml validatior]
* Build time hard limit [http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/build-configuration/#Build-Timeouts 50 minutes]
* Build time inactivity limit [http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/build-configuration/#Build-Timeouts 10 minutes]
* Support says: The command and the URL to clone currently can't be influenced.
* These commands "$ rvm use default --install --binary --fuzzy ; $ ruby --version ; $ rvm --version ; $ gem --version" are not required. Support says: As for the commands listed, those can't be removed either, and they shouldn't add any significant load or time to your build.
* Support says: Regarding retaining storage, we have an APT caching service in the works, that's currently in testing. It won't be host-local, but it'll be network-local.
* Build failed log: https://api.travis-ci.org/jobs/12119447/log.txt?deansi=true - Failed due to missing device-mapper. No idea if possible to fix. - [https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/1493 Opened a ticket.]
* [https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/1495 impossible to start haveged daemon]
* [https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/1494 very low entropy, gpg key creation takes very long]: workaround in place. <ref>If is CI detected... Linking {{Code|/dev/urandom}} to {{Code|/dev/random}}. In CI environment, there is usually very little entropy. Therefore gpg key creation takes very long. Since no images are deployed from CI systems, we can do this.</ref>
* If image creation isn't possible, Travis CI could still be used to check if the whonix_build script works with --bare-metal switch.

== drone.io ==
* <html><img src="https://drone.io/github.com/Whonix/Whonix/status.png" alt="loading..."></html>
* Only building Whonix Debian Packages. No virtual machine images or physically isolated machines, because build timeout is too short. Only running.
