* Support says: The command and the URL to clone currently can't be influenced.
* These commands "$ rvm use default --install --binary --fuzzy ; $ ruby --version ; $ rvm --version ; $ gem --version" are not required. Support says: As for the commands listed, those can't be removed either, and they shouldn't add any significant load or time to your build.
* Support says: Regarding retaining storage, we have an APT caching service in the works, that's currently in testing. It won't be host-local, but it'll be network-local.
* Build failed log: https://api.travis-ci.org/jobs/12119447/log.txt?deansi=true - Failed due to missing device-mapper. No idea if possible to fix. - Asked support.
* If image creation isn't possible, Travis CI could still be used to check if the whonix_build script works with --bare-metal switch.
