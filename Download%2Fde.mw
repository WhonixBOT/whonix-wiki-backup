Achtung:

* If you don't know what a metadata or a man-in-the-middle attack is.
* If you think nobody can eavesdrop on your communications because you are using Tor.
* If you have no idea about how Whonix works.

Then, have a look at the [[About|About]], [[Warning|Warning]] and [[DoNot|Do Not]] pages to make sure that Whonix is the right tool for you and you understand well its limitations.

It is important to check the integrity of the virtual machine images you downloaded to make sure no man-in-the-middle attack or file corruption happened. (See [[Download Security|Download Security]].)

Whonix virtual machine images are cryptographically signed using OpenPGP<ref>OpenPGP is a standard for data encryption that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication through the use of keys owned by its users.</ref> by Whonix developer Patrick Schleizer.

If you know how to use an OpenPGP key, download the [[Whonix Signing Key|Whonix Signing Key]] and the [[#Download Whonix|Whonix signatures]] straight away.

Otherwise, follow the instructions:

* [[Verify_the_virtual_machine_images_using_Linux|For Linux: Ubuntu, Debian, Whonix, etc. using kgpg]]
* [[Verify the_virtual_machine_images_using_the_command line|For Linux with the command line]]
* [[Verify_the_virtual_machine_images_using_other_operating systems|For Windows or Mac]]

= Install Whonix =

== 1. Before installing ==

Read and apply the [[Pre_Install_Advice|Security Advice]].

== 2. Install ==

* Download and install [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads VirtualBox]. <ref>You could alternatively search for a Portable VirtualBox</ref>
* [[#Download Whonix|Download Whonix]] and import both Whonix images<ref>You need both Whonix-Gateway.ova and Whonix-Workstation.ova images. Whonix is a two machine setup.</ref> into VirtualBox. Do not change any settings when importing!
* Take a snapshot for both Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation on VirtualBox. So you can easily restore the original snapshot whenever you need a clean state.

=== Need help? ===

There is a tutorial with screenshots, see [[Install|Install]].

== 3. After installing ==

Read and apply the [[Post Install Advice|Post Install Advice]].

=  Stay tuned =

== Introduction ==
Reading the latest news is important to stay on top of latest developments. Should security vulnerabilities ever be found in Whonix or should an improved version be released, you should be informed.

== Whonix News Blogs ==
[[File:Whonix News Blog opened offline created by adrelanos.png|thumb|alt=Whonix News Blogs Screenshot|Whonix News Blogs]]
There are two ways to get news. Choose at your preference.

# [https://anonymousoperatingsystem.wordpress.com/category/important/ Whonix Important Blog] - Most important stuff only. Security vulnerabilities and new stable versions only. For people with very limited time and interest in Whonix development and news.
# [https://anonymousoperatingsystem.wordpress.com/ Whonix Feature Blog] - Includes everything from Whonix Important Blog. Also testers-only and developers versions are announced. Has a relaxed posting policy. Also blog posts about updated articles, new features, future features, development, call for testing, general project thoughts and so on will be published.

When you start '''Tor Browser Recommended''', there is a shortcut on the desktop, see [[Image:important.png|alt=Tor Browser Recommend Icon|r]] , it will open both Whonix News Blogs in a privacy friendly way. It's recommended at least to read Whonix Important Blog if you are in a hurry. Have a look into Whonix Feature Blog if you are generally interested to learn about anonymity/privacy/security related things or to see what's going on with Whonix.

== Operating System Updates ==
You should regularly check for operating system updates on your host operating system, on Whonix-Workstation and on Whonix-Gateway as highly recommended in the [[Security Guide|Security Guide]].

== Tor Browser ==
[[Image:whonixcheck_gui.png|alt=whonixcheck graphical user interface screenshot|[[whonixcheck|whonixcheck]]|thumb]]

There is no auto-update feature for Tor Browser. You will be notified about new Tor Browser versions by [[whonixcheck|whonixcheck]]. Tor Browser's built in update check mechanism also works in Whonix. For instructions how to update the browser, see [[Tor Browser|Tor Browser]]. Additionally it might also be wise to subscribe to https://blog.torproject.org for news.

== Whonix Version Check and Whonix News ==
[[File:whonixcheck created by adrelanos.png|alt=whonixcheck graphical user interface screnshot|thumb|Whonix Version Check (first rectangle in black) and<br />Whonix News <br />(second rectangle in green)]]
Furthermore you will be automatically notified about new Whonix versions by Whonix Version Check and about the most important occurrences<ref>Such as when a version becomes unsupported, if manual action is required, if major features break, or if security vulnerabilities are found. The policy is to use Whonix News as rarely as possible.</ref> by Whonix News, both of which are part of [[whonixcheck|whonixcheck]].

== Social Media Profiles ==
There are some [[Official Whonix Online Profiles|Whonix Social Media Profiles]], but please don't rely on them for getting Whonix News and please don't use them to contact Whonix developers. (See [[Contact|Contact]] for contact information.)

Because some people will do so even though it is not recommended, messages from the Whonix Feature Blog will be automatically mirrored to [https://twitter.com/Whonix Whonix Twitter Profile], to [https://www.facebook.com/Whonix Whonix Facebook Profile] and to [https://plus.google.com/108150429836421683225/ Whonix Google+ Profile].

If you won't get into trouble by letting others learn about Whonix, feel free to follow or like those profiles (with your anonymous account) as a little way to [[Contribute|Contribute]].

== Source Code ==
In case you are interested in Whonix source code updates, [[Dev/git#subscribe_to_code_changes|subscribe to code changes]].

= Known bugs =

== Normal ==

=== Mounting (CD/DVD) Devices ===
You can use the following workaround.

<pre>
sudo mkdir /mnt/cdrom
</pre>

<pre>
sudo mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom/
</pre>

The following message.

<pre>
mount: block device /dev/sr0 is write-protected, mounting read-only
</pre>

Is expected. (It's normal that CD/DVD's are mounted read-only.)

Help fixing this bug is welcome!

=== VLC / Video Player Crash ===

You can use this workaround.
<pre>
VLC -> Tools -> Preferences -> Video -> Output -> X11 -> Save
</pre>

== Minor ==

=== "apt-get source package" will show "dpkg-source: warning: failed to verify signature" ===
More info [http://lists.debian.org/debian-derivatives/2013/08/msg00000.html here] (and in the following mails).

It is only a warning. If you want, you can get rid of it with the following workaround.

1. Modify <code>/etc/dpkg/origins/default</code>.

<pre>
sudo unlink /etc/dpkg/origins/default
sudo ln -s /etc/dpkg/origins/debian /etc/dpkg/origins/default
</pre>

2. {{Code|apt-get source package}}

3. Undo afterwards to prevent unexpected issues.

<pre>
sudo unlink /etc/dpkg/origins/default
sudo ln -s /etc/dpkg/origins/whonix /etc/dpkg/origins/default
</pre>
