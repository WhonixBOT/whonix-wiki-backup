| text       = Consistent use of the Whonix Tor Hidden Service affords several benefits. It provides alternative end-to-end encryption which is independent from [[SSL]] certificate authorities, independence from the mainstream domain name system, and it also reduces the load on Tor exit nodes.

To do this, simply follow these links below to browse the Whonix main page, homepage, forums, download page, phabricator site, or the Whonix Debian repository:

* [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Main_Page wiki] [http://kkkkkkkkkk63ava6.onion/wiki/Main_Page onion]
* [https://www.whonix.org homepage] [http://kkkkkkkkkk63ava6.onion onion]

* [https://deb.whonix.org debian repository] [http://deb.kkkkkkkkkk63ava6.onion onion]


Once a user rule is configured (see below), using Whonix .onion addresses is easy and seamless.

== Requirements == <!--T:4-->

<!--T:5-->
* The user must have Tor Browser installed, which is the default in Whonix.

== Background == <!--T:6-->

<!--T:7-->
[https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere HTTPS Everywhere] is a very clever tool created by developers at the [https://www.eff.org EFF]. It automatically forces encrypted communications (HTTPS) on many major websites (where it is offered), preventing the user from browsing the HTTP (insecure) version. However, HTTPS Everywhere supports user rules, and it is not limited to HTTP(S). This means the user can configure it to rewrite requests from the .org extension to .onion domains instead! <ref>Because of the way most popular webapps are written, they expect to be at one location, for example whonix.org/blog, and not at multiple locations. That is why this workaround is needed.

----
== Adding User Rules == <!--T:8-->

<!--T:9-->
Locate the directory "HTTPSEverywhereUserRules". It should be named something similar to {{Code2|/home/user/.tb/tor-browser/Browser/TorBrowser/Data/Browser/profile.default/HTTPSEverywhereUserRules/}}. 

<!--T:10-->
Create a new file called {{Code2|WhonixOnion.xml}}.

<!--T:11-->
{{Open_File|filename=
/home/user/.tb/tor-browser/Data/Browser/profile.default/HTTPSEverywhereUserRules/WhonixOnion.xml
}}

<!--T:12-->
And paste.
{{CodeSelect|code=
<ruleset name="Whonix Onion">
  <target host="whonix.org" />
  <target host="www.whonix.org" />
  <target host="phabricator.whonix.org" />
  <target host="forums.whonix.org" />
  <target host="download.whonix.org" />
  <target host="deb.whonix.org" />
  <rule from="^https?://(.*\.?)whonix\.org/" to="http://$1kkkkkkkkkk63ava6.onion/"/>
</ruleset>
}}
Save.

----
== (Re)Start Tor Browser == <!--T:13-->

<!--T:14-->
After installing the user rule, start or restart Tor browser. When navigating to www.whonix.org, HTTPS Everywhere will automatically engage and instead send the user to kkkkkkkkkk63ava6.onion. To disable this functionality, disable the ruleset using the HTTPS Everywhere icon in the upper right of the browser window, or simply delete the file.

<!--T:15-->
Happy browsing!
