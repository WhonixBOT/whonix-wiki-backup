| text       = Consistent use of the Whonix Onion Service affords several benefits. It provides alternative end-to-end encryption which is independent from [[SSL]] certificate authorities, independence from the mainstream domain name system, and it also reduces the load on Tor exit nodes.

To do this, simply follow these links below to browse the Whonix main page, homepage, forums, download page, phabricator site, or the Whonix Debian repository <ref>The v3 onion service is only available for those running the Tor client v3.2 or higher in Whonix-Gateway (<code>sys-whonix</code>).</ref>:

Once a user rule is configured (see below), using Whonix .onion addresses is easy and seamless.

== Requirements == <!--T:4-->

<!--T:5-->
* The user must have Tor Browser installed, which is the default in Whonix.
* v3 onion connections require Tor v3.2 or above running in the Whonix-Gateway (<code>sys-whonix</code>).

== Background == <!--T:6-->

<!--T:7-->
[https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere HTTPS Everywhere] is a very clever tool created by developers at the [https://www.eff.org EFF]. It automatically forces encrypted communications (HTTPS) on many major websites (where it is offered), preventing the user from browsing the HTTP (insecure) version. However, HTTPS Everywhere supports user rules, and it is not limited to HTTP(S). This means the user can configure it to rewrite requests from the .org extension to .onion domains instead! <ref>Because of the way most popular webapps are written, they expect to be at one location, for example whonix.org/blog, and not at multiple locations. That is why this workaround is needed.

== Adding User Rules == 

<!--T:8-->
Using "HTTPSEverywhereUserRules" directory for user rules is no longer supported. HTTPSEverywhere developer jeremyn clearly stated <ref> See details here: https://github.com/EFForg/https-everywhere/issues/14375#issuecomment-359449102</ref>:

<blockquote>HTTPSEverywhereUserRules/ is not supported with WebExtensions and won't be supported.</blockquote>
                                                                                                         
----

== Other Rules == <!--T:16-->

<!--T:17-->
Other similar rulesets - like those found on the [https://github.com/chris-barry/darkweb-everywhere Darkweb Everywhere github page] - do not work either, since they also depend on using the "HTTPSEverywhereUserRules" directory.
