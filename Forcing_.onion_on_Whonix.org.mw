|description=Instructions on how to set up a Whonix Download Mirror
}}

If you would like to use alternative end-to-end encryption (independent from [[SSL]] certificate authorities), be independent from the mainstream domain name system or want to reduce your load on Tor's exit nodes, browsing this wiki (and our [https://www.whonix.org/forum forums] and [https://www.whonix.org/blog blog]) using our .onion address is easy and seamless, once configured. 

== Requirements ==

* Tor Browser Bundle (If you're using Whonix, you already have this.)

== Background ==

HTTPS Everywhere is a very clever tool created by folks at the [https://www.eff.org EFF] to automatically take you from browsing HTTP (insecure) versions of popular websites to the HTTPS (more secure) version, if that particular website offers it. However, HTTPS Everywhere supports user rules, and it is not limited to HTTP(S), so you can configure it to take you to our .onion instead of our .org!

== Installing the Plugin ==

[https://github.com/chris-barry/darkweb-everywhere/releases Darkweb-everywhere] is installed as a browser plugin. The releases are hosted on Github. Make sure to download and verify the signature of the extension. It is PGP signed by one of the developers. This plugin does not ship a Chrome version as it is only expected to be installed along with the tor browser bundle.

== (re)Start your browser ==

After installing the user rule, start or restart your Tor browser. When you browse out to www.whonix.org, HTTPS Everywhere will automatically engage, and send you to xxxxxxxxxxh5kyrx.onion. If you want to disable this functionality, disable the ruleset using the HTTPS Everywhere icon in the upper right of the browser window, or simply delete the file.

Happy browsing!
