If you would like to use alternative end-to-end encryption (independent from [[SSL]] certificate authorities), be independent from the mainstream domain name system or want to reduce your load on Tor's exit nodes, browsing this wiki (and our [https://www.whonix.org/old-forum forums] and [https://www.whonix.org/blog blog]) using our .onion address is easy and seamless, once configured. 

== Requirements == <!--T:4-->

<!--T:5-->
* Tor Browser Bundle (If you're using Whonix, you already have this.)

== Background == <!--T:6-->

<!--T:7-->
HTTPS Everywhere is a very clever tool created by folks at the [https://www.eff.org EFF] to automatically take you from browsing HTTP (insecure) versions of popular websites to the HTTPS (more secure) version, if that particular website offers it. However, HTTPS Everywhere supports user rules, and it is not limited to HTTP(S), so you can configure it to take you to our .onion instead of our .org!

== Adding the user rule == <!--T:8-->

<!--T:9-->
Locate the directory "HTTPSEverywhereUserRules", it should be {{Code2|/home/user/.tb/tor-browser/Data/Browser/profile.default/HTTPSEverywhereUserRules}} or somewhere close to that. 

<!--T:10-->
Create a new file called {{Code2|WhonixOnion.xml}}.

<!--T:11-->
{{Open_File|filename=
/home/user/.tb/tor-browser/Data/Browser/profile.default/HTTPSEverywhereUserRules/WhonixOnion.xml
}}

<!--T:12-->
And paste.
{{CodeSelect|code=
<ruleset name="Whonix Onion">
  <target host="whonix.org" />
  <target host="www.whonix.org" />
  <rule from="^https?://(www\.)?whonix\.org/" to="http://xxxxxxxxxxh5kyrx.onion/"/>
</ruleset>
}}
Save.

== (re)Start your browser == <!--T:13-->

<!--T:14-->
After installing the user rule, start or restart your Tor browser. When you browse out to www.whonix.org, HTTPS Everywhere will automatically engage, and send you to xxxxxxxxxxh5kyrx.onion. If you want to disable this functionality, disable the ruleset using the HTTPS Everywhere icon in the upper right of the browser window, or simply delete the file.

<!--T:15-->
Happy browsing!
