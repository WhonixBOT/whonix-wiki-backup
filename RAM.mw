= Advice for Systems with Low RAM =
{{project name}} with CLI (command line interface) is normally for advanced users only. However, unless the user wants to upgrade the system or change the configuration even {{project name}} with Xfce graphical user interface users can reduce {{Gateway product name}} RAM and VRAM assignment. {{gateway_product_name}} can work with as little as 196 MB RAM, but resource intensive operations like upgrades can leave the virtual machine in a frozen state. <ref>
Such as kernel package upgrades that rebuild the initrd.
</ref> Assigning less than 512 MB RAM to a {{project name}} VM will result in [[rads|RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter]] starting CLI but not Xfce. Therefore, in case:

'''A)''' <u>{{gateway_product_name}} RAM Saving Mode</u>

{{box|text=
The user just wants to run {{Gateway product name}} after its initial first boot setup or after upgrades: 

# Shutdown {{Gateway product name}}.
# Assign less RAM {{Gateway product name}}: <code>Virtual machine</code> &rarr; <code>Menu</code> &rarr; <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code><i>Adjust</i></code> <code>Memory slider to 128</code> &rarr; <code><i>Hit:</i> OK</code>
# Assign less VRAM to {{Gateway product name}}: <code>VirtualBox</code> &rarr; <code>click a VM</code> &rarr; <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code>Display</code> &rarr; <code>Graphics Controller</code> &rarr; <code><i>Adjust</i></code> <code>slider for Video Memory to 16</code> &rarr; <code>OK</code>
# Restart {{Gateway product name}}.
# Start {{Workstation product name}}.

Done, {{Gateway product name}} is now serving {{Workstation product name}} but operates with less RAM.
}}

'''B)''' <u>{{gateway_product_name}} Graphical Administration Mode</u>

{{box|text=
The user wants to upgrade {{project name}} or change Tor settings:

# Shut down all VMs.
# Assign default RAM to {{Gateway product name}}.
# Assign default VRAM to {{Gateway product name}}.
# Start {{Gateway product name}}.
# The user will now have access to a graphical {{Gateway product name}} with Xfce.
# Perform administrative tasks such as upgrades and/or change Tor settings.
# Shutdown {{Gateway product name}}.
# Apply RAM Saving Mode as described above.

Done, the user upgraded or changed settings using a graphical {{Gateway product name}} with Xfce.

Alternatively, advanced users comfortable with {{project name}} with CLI could of course also permanently use {{project name}} with CLI.
