** {{Workstation product name}} Xfce - 2048 MB RAM and 128 MB VRAM

= Advice for Systems with Low RAM =
{{project name}} with CLI (command line interface) is normally for advanced users only. However, unless the user wants to upgrade the system or change the configuration even {{project name}} with Xfce graphical user interface users can reduce {{Gateway product name}} RAM and VRAM assignment. {{gateway_product_name}} can work with as little as 196 MB RAM, but resource intensive operations like upgrades can leave the virtual machine in a frozen state. <ref>
Such as kernel package upgrades that rebuild the initrd.
</ref> Assigning less than 512 MB RAM to a {{project name}} VM will result in [[rads|RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter]] starting CLI but not Xfce. Therefore, in case:

The user just wants to run {{Gateway product name}} after its initial first boot setup or after upgrades: 

{{box|text=
# shutdown {{Gateway product name}}
# assign less RAM and VRAM to {{Gateway product name}}
# restart {{Gateway product name}}
# start {{Workstation product name}}

Done, {{Gateway product name}} is now serving {{Workstation product name}} but operates with less RAM.
}}

The user wants to upgrade {{project name}} or change Tor settings:

{{box|text=
# shut down all other VMs (such as {{Workstation product name}})
# assign default RAM and VRAM to {{Gateway product name}}
# start {{Gateway product name}}
# the user will now have access to a graphical {{Gateway product name}} with Xfce
# upgrade and/or change Tor settings
# shutdown {{Gateway product name}}

Done, the user upgraded or changed settings using a graphical {{Gateway product name}} with Xfce.
