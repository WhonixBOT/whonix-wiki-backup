= Defaults =
* {{project name}} Xfce
** {{Gateway product name}} Xfce - 1280 MB RAM and 128 MB VRAM.
** {{Workstation product name}} Xfce - 2048 MB RAM and 128 MB VRAM
* {{project name}} CLI
** {{Gateway product name}} CLI - 512 MB RAM and 16 MB VRAM.
** {{Workstation product name}} CLI - 512 MB RAM and 16 MB VRAM

= Advice for Systems with Low RAM =
{{project name}} with CLI (command line interface) is normally for advanced users only. However, unless the user wants to upgrade the system or change the configuration even {{project name}} with Xfce graphical user interface users can reduce {{Gateway product name}} RAM and VRAM assignment. {{gateway_product_name}} can work with as little as 196 MB RAM, but resource intensive operations like upgrades can leave the virtual machine in a frozen state. <ref>
Such as kernel package upgrades that rebuild the initrd.
</ref> Assigning less than 512 MB RAM to a {{project name}} VM will result in [[rads|RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter]] starting CLI but not Xfce. Therefore, in case:

'''A)''' The user just wants to run {{Gateway product name}} after its initial first boot setup or after upgrades: 

{{box|text=
# shutdown {{Gateway product name}}
# assign less RAM {{Gateway product name}}
# assign less VRAM to {{Gateway product name}}: <code>VirtualBox</code> &rarr; <code>click a VM</code> &rarr; <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code>Display</code> &rarr; <code>Graphics Controller</code> &rarr; <code>decrease slider for Video Memory to 16</code> &rarr; <code>OK</code>
# restart {{Gateway product name}}
# start {{Workstation product name}}

Done, {{Gateway product name}} is now serving {{Workstation product name}} but operates with less RAM.
}}

'''B)''' The user wants to upgrade {{project name}} or change Tor settings:

{{box|text=
# shut down all VMs
# assign default RAM to {{Gateway product name}}
# assign default VRAM to {{Gateway product name}}
# start {{Gateway product name}}
# the user will now have access to a graphical {{Gateway product name}} with Xfce
# upgrade and/or change Tor settings
# shutdown {{Gateway product name}}

Done, the user upgraded or changed settings using a graphical {{Gateway product name}} with Xfce.
