= Defaults =
* {{project name}} Xfce
** {{Gateway product name}} Xfce - 1280 MB RAM and 128 MB VRAM.
** {{Workstation product name}} Xfce - 2048 MB RAM and 128 MB VRAM
* {{project name}} CLI
** {{Gateway product name}} CLI - 512 MB RAM and 16 MB VRAM.
** {{Workstation product name}} CLI - 512 MB RAM and 16 MB VRAM

= Advice for Systems with Low RAM =
{{project name}} with CLI (command line interface) is normally for advanced users only. However, unless the user wants to upgrade the system or change the configuration even {{project name}} with Xfce graphical user interface users can reduce {{Gateway product name}} RAM and VRAM assignment. {{gateway_product_name}} can work with as little as 256 MB RAM, but resource intensive operations like upgrades can leave the virtual machine in a frozen state. <ref name=kernel-upgrade>
Such as kernel package upgrades that rebuild the initrd.
</ref> Assigning less than 512 MB RAM to a {{project name}} VM will result in [[rads|RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter]] starting CLI but not Xfce. There are various options.

'''A)''' <u>{{gateway_product_name}} CLI RAM Saving Mode</u>

{{box|text=
The user just wants to run {{Gateway product name}} after its initial first boot setup or after upgrades: 

# Shutdown {{Gateway product name}}.
# Assign less RAM {{Gateway product name}}: <code>Virtual machine</code> &rarr; <code>Menu</code> &rarr; <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code><i>Adjust</i></code> <code>Memory slider to 256</code> &rarr; <code><i>Hit:</i> OK</code>
# Assign less VRAM to {{Gateway product name}}: <code>VirtualBox</code> &rarr; <code>click a VM</code> &rarr; <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code>Display</code> &rarr; <code>Graphics Controller</code> &rarr; <code><i>Adjust</i></code> <code>slider for Video Memory to 16</code> &rarr; <code>OK</code>
# Restart {{Gateway product name}}.
# Start {{Workstation product name}}.

Done, {{Gateway product name}} is now serving {{Workstation product name}} but operates with less RAM.
}}

'''B)''' <u>{{gateway_product_name}} Graphical Administration Mode</u>

{{box|text=
The user wants to upgrade {{project name}} or change Tor settings:

# Shut down all VMs.
# Assign default RAM to {{Gateway product name}}. ([[Post_Install_Advice#Increase_Virtual_Machine_RAM|Increase Virtual Machine RAM]])
# Assign default VRAM to {{Gateway product name}}.
# Start {{Gateway product name}}.
# The user will now have access to a graphical {{Gateway product name}} with Xfce.
# Perform administrative tasks such as upgrades and/or change Tor settings.
# Shutdown {{Gateway product name}}.
# Apply RAM Saving Mode as described above.

Done, the user upgraded or changed settings using a graphical {{Gateway product name}} with Xfce.
}}

'''C)''' <u>{{workstation_product_name}} CLI RAM Saving Mode</u>

{{box|text=
{{workstation_product_name}} CLI (when not using the Xfce desktop environment) can be run with with as little as 256 MB RAM, but resource intensive operations like upgrades can leave the virtual machine in a frozen state. <ref name=kernel-upgrade /> Assign more RAM during upgrades. 450 MB RAM should be more than enough.
}}

'''D)''' <u>{{workstation_product_name}} Xfce RAM Saving Mode</u>

{{box|text=
{{workstation_product_name}} Xfce can be run with with as little as 512 MB RAM, but resource intensive operations like upgrades can leave the virtual machine in a frozen state. <ref name=kernel-upgrade /> Assign more RAM during upgrades. 1280 MB RAM should be more than enough. Some applications, especially browsers ([[Tor Browser]], more so when using too many open browser tabs at the same time) might have reduced performance or the VM might freeze due to low RAM.
}}

Alternatively:

* <u>{{gateway_product_name}} Xfce RAM Saving Mode</u>: {{gateway_product_name}} Xfce can run with as little as 512 MB RAM, but resource intensive operations like upgrades can leave the virtual machine in a frozen state. <ref name=kernel-upgrade /> For upgrading, increase as described above for {{gateway_product_name}} Graphical Administration Mode.
* <u>{{project name}} with CLI</u>: Advanced users comfortable with {{project name}} with CLI could of course also permanently use {{project name}} with CLI.
* <u>Experiments</u>: Experimentation with RAM lower than 256 MB is up to the user; please share your results.
