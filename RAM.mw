= Defaults =
* {{project name}} Xfce
** {{Gateway product name}} Xfce - 1280 MB RAM and 128 MB VRAM.
** {{Workstation product name}} Xfce - 2048 MB RAM and 128 MB VRAM
* {{project name}} CLI
** {{Gateway product name}} CLI - 512 MB RAM and 16 MB VRAM.
** {{Workstation product name}} CLI - 512 MB RAM and 16 MB VRAM

= Advice for Systems with Low RAM =
{{project name}} with CLI (command line interface) is normally for advanced users only. However, unless the user wants to upgrade the system or change the configuration even {{project name}} with Xfce graphical user interface users can reduce {{Gateway product name}} RAM and VRAM assignment. {{gateway_product_name}} can work with as little as 196 MB RAM, but resource intensive operations like upgrades can leave the virtual machine in a frozen state. <ref>
Such as kernel package upgrades that rebuild the initrd.
</ref> Assigning less than 512 MB RAM to a {{project name}} VM will result in [[rads|RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter]] starting CLI but not Xfce. Therefore, in case:

* the user just wants to run {{Gateway product name}} after its initial first boot setup or after upgrades: shutdown {{Gateway product name}} &rarr; assign less RAM and VRAM to {{Gateway product name}} &rarr; restart {{Gateway product name}}
* the user wants to upgrade {{project name}} or change Tor settings: shut down all other VMs (such as {{Workstation product name}}) &rarr; assign default RAM and VRAM to {{Gateway product name}} &rarr; start {{Gateway product name}} &rarr; upgrade and/or change Tor settings &rarr; shutdown {{Gateway product name}}
