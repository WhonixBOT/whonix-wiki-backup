= 7.7.6.4 Build Documentation (short) =

This is a short set of instructions for building 7.7.6.4 testers-only version of Whonix (later to be modified to Whonix 8).

The focus here is to show the simplest way to build Whonix from source. Various security precausions such as XXX are ommited.

Please read the full [[Dev/BuildDocumentation_8#Build_Documentation.|documentation]] in order to understand the process better.

== Get Debian ==
Download and verify Debian Stable/Wheezy 32 bit installation ISO. The [[Debian]] page contains some help.

Since you'll be using the command line, select Debian Testing/Jessie network install (netinst) version (it's the most minimal).

== Get and prepare VirtualBox ==
Download the latest version of VirtualBox (that being 4.3.6 in January, 2014) and verify the downloaded packages by comparing SHA256 checksums.

https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
http://dlc.sun.com.edgesuite.net/virtualbox/4.3.6/SHA256SUMS

After you install VirtualBox create a new virtual machine with the following specifics.

<pre>
Name: Debian
Type: Linux
Version: Debian

Memory size: (go with recommended memory size)
Hard Drive: Create a virtual hard drive now / Create
Hard drive file type: VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image) / Next
Storage on physical hard drive: Dynamically allocated / Next
File location and size: 50 GB / Create
<pre>

Start the newly created virtual machine, select the ISO of Debian 7.3 stable (debian-7.3.0-i386-netinst.iso) and click Start.

== Install Debian ==
In the installer boot menu of Debian Testing (Jessie) press "Install" and choose following settings:

<pre>
Select a language: English
Select your location: United Kingdom
Configure the keyboard: American English
Hostname: host
Domain name: (empty)
Root password: (set up a strong password)
Full name for the new user: user
Username for your account: user
Password for the new user: (choose a good password, different from root password)
Partitioning method: Guided - use entire disk (it's a good idea to set up cryptsetup encrypted LVM at this point)
Partitioning scheme: All files in one partition (select the listed device in the next step)
Partition disks/overview: Finish partitioning
Write changes to disk: Yes

((if using network install; -netinst.iso))
((Debian archive mirror country: Go back))
((Continue without a network mirror: Yes))

((if using CD Binary; -CD-x.iso))
((Scan another CD or DVD: No))

Use a network mirror: No
Participate in the package usage survey: No
Software selection: None; deselect all options (using Space)
Install the GRUB boot loader: Yes (select the listed device in the next step)
Finish the installation: Continue
