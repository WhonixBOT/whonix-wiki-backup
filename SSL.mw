== User Documentation ==
SSL in Wikipedia <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security</ref>

The public SSL certificate authority system is not to be trusted. Too many security breaches happened. <ref>See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigiNotar DigiNotar], [http://www.scmagazine.com/two-more-comodo-resellers-owned-in-ssl-hack/article/199620/ Comodo] and [http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/01/google-fraudulent-certificate/ Turktrust].</ref>

== Whonix Design ==
SSL certificates, especially for https://check.torproject.org (check.tpo) are not yet pinned in Whonix. Eventually that will be done in future. That needs some more discussion. How that technically could be done is documented under [[Dev/SSL Certificate Pinning]]. This has low priority for Whonix, since not even the Tor Browser Bundle does pin the check.tpo SSL certificate, which is a much bigger issue. Whonix developer adrelanos does not aggree with "low priority" in TBB. See [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3555 TBB: hardcode SSL cert check to prevent MITM].
