= Access {{gateway_product_name}} Port From Host =
'''Not tested since {{project name}} 0.5.6. May or may not work. Might need changes for later versions.'''

== Example: Make port 9050 accessible from the host. ==
=== Host Setup ===
On the host.

In the {{gateway_product_name}} VM network settings. &rarr; Set up Port Forwarding: &rarr; within the <code>Adapter 1</code> tab click <code>Advanced</code> &rarr; then <code>Port Forwarding</code> &rarr; Insert a new rule as follows.

<pre>
Name: 9050
Protocol: TCP
Host IP: 127.0.0.1
Host Port: 9050
Guest IP: leave blank
Guest Port: 9050
</pre>

Or the same as command line. You might have to adjust the name of your Whonix-Gateway.

XFCE:

{{CodeSelect|code=
VBoxManage modifyvm "{{gateway_product_name_short}}-XFCE" --natpf1 "9050",tcp,127.0.0.1,9050,,9050
}}

CLI:

{{CodeSelect|code=
VBoxManage modifyvm "{{gateway_product_name_short}}-CLI" --natpf1 "9050",tcp,127.0.0.1,9050,,9050
}}

=== {{gateway_product_name}} Setup ===
Inside {{gateway_product_name}}...

IP <code>10.0.2.15</code> is usually obtained from VirtualBox's DHCP server. Hope this always works, otherwise you have to adjust the IP or edit the network config. And use a static virtual LAN IP. ([[Template:Network_Config]])

{{Open /usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf}}

Add. (The second line is not strictly required, useful for debugging.)

{{CodeSelect|code=
+SocksPort 10.0.2.15:9050
+SocksPort 127.0.0.1:9050
}}

Save.

{{Reload Tor}}

{{Open File|filename=

Read information about the following configuration options.

{{CodeSelect|code=
EXTERNAL_OPEN_PORTS+=" 9050 "
EXTERNAL_UDP_OPEN_PORTS+=" 9050 "
}}
</ref>

{{Firewall Settings}}

Add.

{{CodeSelect|code=
EXTERNAL_OPEN_PORTS+=" 9050 "
EXTERNAL_UDP_OPEN_PORTS+=" 9050 "
}}

Save.

{{Reload Firewall}}

== Debugging ==

Inside {{gateway_product_name}}...

Switch to clearnet user.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo -u clearnet bash
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
cd ~
}}

Test if the port you want to make available on the host is available from inside {{workstation_product_name}}. (If that's not the case, something is fundamentally wrong and you need to fix this first.)

Circumventing [[Stream_Isolation|uwt]] curl wrapper.

{{CodeSelect|code=
UWT_DEV_PASSTHROUGH=1 curl --output - 127.0.0.1:9050
}}

It should answer <code>This is a SOCKs proxy, not an HTTP proxy.</code>.

== Testing ==

On the host...

{{CodeSelect|code=
curl 127.0.0.1:9050
}}

It should answer <code>This is a SOCKs proxy, not an HTTP proxy.</code>.

If you see that, that indicates that Tor is, which runs inside {{gateway_product_name}} is accessible on the host as well.

== Forwarding that port to LAN ==

On the host...

This is untested, but should work.

You can use something like socat or systemd-socket-proxyd to redirect that port <code>127.0.0.1:9050</code> to a different network interface. Otherwise you could experiment with the {{gateway_product_name}} VM network settings.
