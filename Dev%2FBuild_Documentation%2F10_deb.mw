'''UNFINISHED!'''

= Upgrading Whonix Deb Packages from Source Code =
== Introduction ==
This assumes you are updating Whonix's debian packages while you are using Whonix.

== Prerequisites ==
Might be a good idea to create a backup and/or clone before trying to update.

If you haven't done already, disable Whonix's APT repository. <ref>[[Whonix-APT-Repository#Disable_Whonix_APT_Repository]]</ref>

<pre>
sudo whonix_repository --disable
</pre>

Upgrade from Debian packages.

<pre>
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get --yes dist-upgrade
</pre>

{{Build Documentation Get Source Code}}

== Build Dependencies ==
Get all build dependencies.

<pre>
sudo ./build-steps.d/1100_prepare-build-machine --target root
</pre>

Why {{Code2|--target root}}? This is correct, if you want to know why, see footnote. <ref>Setting the BARE_METAL variable to 1 will result in installing fewer build dependencies. For example VirtualBox will not be installed. These are only required to build full images, but since we just want to create updated Whonix Debian Packages, this is unnecessary. Not much harm done when forgetting to use {{Code2|--target root}}, because the user is free to remove any build dependencies later.</ref>

== Create the Packages ==
<pre>
sudo -E ./build-steps.d/1200_create-debian-packages --target root --build --internalrun
</pre>

== Upgrade Whonix Debian Packages ==
Upgrade Whonix Debian Packages without contacting a Whonix's APT Repository, using your own locally created apt package repository.

For Whonix-Gateway.

<pre>
sudo ./packages/whonix-developer-meta-files/debug-steps/locally-upgrade-whonix-debian-packages --target root --flavor whonix-gateway --build
</pre>

<ref>Why use "--target root"? Technical explanation: "--target root" in context of Whonix's source code means "do it on the system currently running, i.e. do it directly on the root folder "/[...]", don't do it inside "vm_image/[...]".</ref>

For Whonix-Workstation.

<pre>
sudo ./packages/whonix-developer-meta-files/debug-steps/locally-upgrade-whonix-debian-packages --target root --flavor whonix-workstation --build
</pre>

There will be a lot debug output. <ref>Unless you log in as root and run "export WHONIX_DEB_DEBUG=0".</ref>

If everything went well, you will see <ref>Or saying Whonix-Gateway respectively</ref> <ref>It won't, if you have "export WHONIX_DEB_DEBUG=0" set.</ref>

<pre>
########################################################################
## INFO: Successfully configured (postinst script) Whonix-Workstation. #
########################################################################
</pre>

Last message will probably<ref>"probably" means, if we don't change some messages in meanwhile and forget to update this page.</ref> be:

<pre>
+ true 'INFO: Skipping script, because BARE_METAL=1: /home/user/whonix_dot/Whonix/help-steps/unmount-img'
</pre>

In case any error is caught, the script will loudly complain by echoing in a red colored error message:

<pre>
ERROR in ./debug-steps/locally-upgrade-whonix-debian-packages! Aborted.
</pre>

Lets hope it works well. Please get in [[Support|Contact]] should there be any issues. Leave feedback if you are using this, if it worked for you, which issues you may have had, so these instructions can be updated.
