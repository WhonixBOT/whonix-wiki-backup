<blockquote>Tor makes it possible for users to hide their locations while offering various kinds of services, such as web publishing or an instant messaging server. [...] other Tor users can connect to these onion services, formerly known as hidden services, each without knowing the other's network identity.</blockquote><ref>https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/onion-services.html.en</ref>

= Tor Onion Services: Configuration =

== Introduction ==

Newcomers to this topic are recommended to first read the following Tor Project and Riseup documentation entries to better understand how onion services work, how they are safely configured outside of {{project_name}}, and suggested best practices:
* [https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/onion-services.html.en Tor: Onion Service Protocol] (general information);
* [https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/tor-onion-service Configuring Onion Services for Tor] (standard setup, no isolated proxy); and
* [https://riseup.net/en/security/network-security/tor/onionservices-best-practices Best Practices for Hosting Onion Services] (installation, configuration and protecting services)

Note that onion services are always only reachable using Tor or tunnel services, such as [https://www.tor2web.org/ tor2web]; [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/tor2web caution is warranted] if using a tunnel service. Also, onion addresses do not require Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer</ref>, because connections to Tor onion services are end-to-end encrypted by default. <ref>To be exact, only tor-to-tor, see [[Onion_Services#Notes_about_End-to-end_security_of_Onion_Services|Notes about End-to-end Security of Onion Services]].</ref> <ref>http://www.quora.com/Is-there-an-SSL-equivalent-for-Tor-Hidden-Services</ref> This is handy, as it is unnecessary to bother with self signed certificates or certificate authorities.

Another interesting onion service property is they can serve as a drop-in Global Server Load Balancing and Layer 3 DDoS-resistance solution. <ref>https://archive.is/Aaqsz</ref> This raises the bar to withstanding attacks that the entire Tor network can tolerate; the same applies to [[I2P|I2P Eepsites]]. Tor can also be considered a very simple to configure, encrypted transport alternative to IPSec. <ref>https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2016-October/042360.html</ref>

Potential adversaries can detect whether the onion service (and presumably Tor) is up and running or not. Even if somebody hacks the hidden server software -- such as <code>micro-httpd</code>, <code>nginx</code>, or <code>apache</code> -- the attacker cannot steal the onion service key or bypass Tor; see [[Comparison with Others#Attacks|Attack on {{project_name}}]]. The reason is the key is stored on the {{gateway_product_name}}. Once the {{workstation_product_name}} is cleaned, it is no longer possible for an adversary to impersonate the onion service.

An exception to this is if onion services are created by software running on {{workstation_product_name}} (examples documented at the time of writing are [[ZeroNet]], [[OnionShare]] and [[Bisq]]). <ref>
These applications are talking to Tor control port directed (filtered) through [[onion-grater]], created through Tor control protocol command <code>ADD_ONION</code>.
</ref> This is opt-in and not happening by default or accident. When following the instructions on this page, this exception does not apply.

For possible alternatives to onion services, see: [[Hosting_Location_Hidden_Services|Hosting Location Hidden Services]].

== Web Server Software Recommendations ==

It is best to avoid the <code>Apache</code> web server because it has much more functionality, leak potential and attack surface than smaller and lighter alternatives. If the Apache web server will be used regardless, refer to the following footnotes. <ref>
It is advised to install [https://packages.debian.org/{{Stable {{project name short}} based on Debian codename}}/libapache2-mod-removeip libapache2-mod-removeip].

{{Install_Package|package=
libapache2-mod-removeip
}}
</ref> <ref>
(Source: [http://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/407fce8f/?limit=25#478a old forum])
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Stop Apache.

'''2.''' In {{Code|ports.conf}}:

<pre>
NameVirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80
Listen 127.0.0.1:80
ServerName localhost
</pre>

'''3.''' In {{Code|sites-available/default}}:
<pre>
</pre>

'''4.''' Start Apache and redirect the listening port.

Apache will not be listening on {{Code|10.152.152.10}}, but only on {{Code|127.0.0.1}}. Therefore it is necessary to redirect {{Code|10.152.152.10:80}} to {{Code|127.0.0.1:80}}.

This can be achieved with a firewall rule or netcat:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo ncat -l 10.152.152.10 80 -c 'ncat 127.0.0.1 80'
}}
}}
</ref>

The <code>Nginx</code> web server is a recommended alternative to Apache.

If your needs are limited to hosting static pages, then look no further than <code>micro-httpd</code> which is available from Debian repositories. It is a bare-bones daemon made up of 150 lines of code. <ref>https://wiki.debian.org/WebServers</ref>

! scope="row"| Hide IP Address
| 
* IP hiding instructions for the specific server software should be applied.
* The reason is because a combination of a webserver that forwards IP addresses to certain web applications such as mediawiki would be a discouraged use case. In mediawiki's case, by default it puts IP addresses of anonymous editors in the public accessible editor logs. The IP address would be <code>10.152.152.10</code>. Although that information cannot be used to identify you because it is not your real external IP address, it would still identify the server as an onion service behind a {{gateway_product_name}}. <ref>Since it is easy to confirm that the internal LAN IP <code>10.152.152.10</code> is normally used by {{gateway_product_name}}.</ref>

== Hidden Webserver ==

=== Whonix-Gateway ===

Perform all the following steps on the {{gateway_product_name}}.

==== Step 1: Open Tor Configuration ====

On the {{gateway_product_name}}.

{{Open_/usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf}}

==== Step 2: Edit Tor Configuration ====

{{Box|text=
On the {{gateway_product_name}}.

This step is necessary for all {{project name}} platforms.

Three settings must be added to <code>/usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf</code>:

* A <code>HiddenServiceDir</code> configuration directive declaring where onion services files (hostname file and private key file) should be stored.
* A <code>HiddenServicePort</code> configuration directive declaring:
** the virtual port; and
** the IP and port of the {{workstation_product_name}} that will run a server service that processes incoming onion service connections.
* <code>HiddenServiceVersion</code> configuration directive declaring which onion service version to utilize (<code>2</code> or <code>3</code>).
}}

{{Box|text=
On the {{gateway_product_name}}.

To specify necessary settings, add the following three lines.

{{Box|text=
[[{{q_project_name_short}}|{{q_project_name}}]]: 

{{IP-of-q-ws-AppVM}}

Make sure to replace <code>IP-of-q-ws-AppVM</code> with the actual IP address of the {{workstation_product_name}}.

{{CodeSelect|code=
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/
HiddenServicePort 80 IP-of-q-ws-AppVM:80
HiddenServiceVersion 3
}}
}}

{{Box|text=
[[{{non q project name short}}|{{non q project name}}]]:

{{CodeSelect|code=
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/
HiddenServicePort 80 10.152.152.11:80
HiddenServiceVersion 3
}}
}}
}}

{{Box|text=
In all {{project name}} platforms, save the changes.
}}

==== Step 3: Configure Onion Services Authentication ====
{{Anchor|Configure Onion Services Authentication}}
{{Box|text=
'''Optional''': authenticated onion services.

<u>Onion services authentication is only possible for private onion services</u> with a limited number of visitors. This is impossible for a public onion service. <u>For a public onion service this step should be skipped.</u> Each visitor needs to be provided with a key file. This chapter describes the server side. The client side is described further below in chapter [[#Onion Service Authentication Client Setup|Onion Service Authentication Client Setup]].

With v3 onions addresses it is no longer possible for adversaries to learn about their existence if they are not published -- this was not the case previously with v2 onion addresses. Therefore, some readers might wonder what is the purpose of onion services authentication for v3 onions.

Authentication for v3 onions exists to eliminate the side risks of the onion address accidentally being leaked. This is feasible due to human error, a bug in the software using the onion address, or other yet unknown possibilities. By using onion services authentication, the onion service could not be accessed even if the onion address was leaked.

Quote: <ref>
The purpose of Onion Services Authentication has been [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2019-December/014105.html asked about on the Tor Talk Mailing List]. Answers:

* https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2019-December/014106.html
* https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2019-December/014107.html
* https://forums.whonix.org/t/onion-services-authentication/975/14
</ref>

<blockquote>
Also, if you have multiple users, having one v3 address with authentication is much better than multiple addresses, for the following reasons:

* easier management
* easier to configure and easier to maintain the application behind it (web server or whatever it is)
* less resources needed by the Tor daemon
* less load on your guard(s) / bridge(s), thus more capacity and better experience for your clients / visitors (if you have multiple addresses you need to maintain active introduction point circuits for all of them, publish descriptors, etc.)
</blockquote>

These instructions are based on [https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/19221/how-to-setup-client-authorization-for-v3-onion-services this reference]. <ref>
But modified since instructions did not create files <code>1.auth_private</code>, <code>1.auth</code> for the user and only echoed these to the shell which most users would not know what to do with.
</ref> These instruction can be quite difficult, but this unspecific to {{Project name}}; these instructions are quite difficult anywhere. [[About#Based_on_Debian|Whonix is based on Debian]] and the [[Free_Support_Principle|Free Support Principle]]. <ref>
The only {{Project name}} specific thing below is <code>str_replace</code>, which is only available in {{Project name}}. This is a tool which makes string search and replace easier.
</ref>

On the {{gateway_product_name}}.

Install <code>basez</code>.

{{Install Package|package=
basez
}}

Create a temporary private key.

{{CodeSelect|code=
openssl genpkey -algorithm x25519 -out private-key.pem
}}

Create a temporary public key.

{{CodeSelect|code=
openssl pkey -in private-key.pem -pubout -outform PEM -out public-key.pem
}}

Create a temporary file.

{{CodeSelect|code=
cat private-key.pem {{!}} \
    grep -v " PRIVATE KEY" {{!}} \
    basez --base64pem --decode {{!}} \
    tail --bytes 32 {{!}} \
    basez --base32 {{!}} \
    tr -d '=' > temp1
}}

Steps towards <code>1.auth_private</code>.

Set the file path variable. Only modify the path below if you did not utilize the defaults specified earlier on in these instructions, namely <code>HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/</code>. Otherwise, no change is required. If changes were made, you might want to change <code>hidden_service</code> to something else below.

{{CodeSelect|code=
file_name="/var/lib/tor/hidden_service/hostname"
}}

Set the onion hostname variable.

{{CodeSelect|code=
hostname="$(sudo cat "$file_name")"
}}

View the onion hostname.

{{CodeSelect|code=
echo "$hostname"
}}

Something similar to the following should appear.

<pre>
bvwxablxzabj4yudgzgooeg55sys2c3li7w5hhnongdm2p62l7hfnvid.onion
</pre>

Create variable <code>onionname</code> without appendix <code>.onion</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
onionname="$(echo "$hostname" {{!}} str_replace .onion "")"
}}

View the onion name.

{{CodeSelect|code=
echo "$onionname"
}}

Something similar to the following should appear.

<pre>
bvwxablxzabj4yudgzgooeg55sys2c3li7w5hhnongdm2p62l7hfnvid
</pre>

Create final <code>1.auth_private</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
echo -n "$onionname:descriptor:x25519:" {{!}} \
    cat - temp1 > 1.auth_private
}}

Steps towards <code>1.auth</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
cat public-key.pem {{!}} \
    grep -v " PUBLIC KEY" {{!}} \
    basez --base64pem --decode {{!}} \
    tail --bytes 32 {{!}} \
    basez --base32 {{!}} \
    tr -d '=' > temp2
}}

Create the final <code>1.auth</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
echo -n "descriptor:x25519:" {{!}} cat - temp2 > 1.auth
}}

Now two files are in existence:

* <code>1.auth</code> which belongs to onion server in folder <code>/var/lib/tor/hidden_service/authorized_clients/</code>.
* <code>1.auth_private</code> which visitors need to be provided with.

It is of course possible to use different file names.

Create folder <code>/var/lib/tor/hidden_service/authorized_clients/</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/authorized_clients/
}}

Copy <code>1.auth</code> to folder <code>/var/lib/tor/hidden_service/authorized_clients/</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo cp 1.auth /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/authorized_clients/
}}

Fix owner permissions.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo chown --recursive debian-tor:debian-tor /var/lib/tor/hidden_service
}}
}}

==== Step 4: Denial of Service Mitigation Options ====

Documentation for Denial of Service Mitigation Options is incomplete. Contributions are happily considered! 

This step requires Tor 0.4.2.5 and above, see: [https://forums.whonix.org/t/tor-0-4-25-release-how-can-we-upgrade/8614 Tor 0.4.25 release how can we upgrade].

Also refer to the [https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en Tor manual] and search for <code>DENIAL OF SERVICE MITIGATION OPTIONS</code>.

Nothing {{Project name}} specific regarding installation from source. As per:

* [[Free_Support_Principle|Free Support Principle]]
* [[About#Based_on_Debian|Based on Debian]]

==== Step 5: Make Tor Configuration Changes Take Effect ====

On the {{gateway_product_name}}.

{{Reload Tor}}

==== Step 6: Retrieve the Onion Hostname ====

On the {{gateway_product_name}}.

To retrive your Tor onion service url, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo cat /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/hostname
}}

==== Step 7: Backup the Tor Onion Service Private Key ====

On the {{gateway_product_name}}.

{{
Backups_Tor_Onion_Service_private_key
|private_key_file=/var/lib/tor/hidden_service/hs_ed25519_secret_key
|file_name=hs_ed25519_secret_key
}}

=== Whonix-Workstation ===

Perform all the following steps on the {{workstation_product_name}}.

==== Step 1: Install Server Software ====

On the {{workstation_product_name}}.

Install <u>either</u> <code>micro-httpd</code> or <code>nginx</code>.

'''A)''' Run the following commands to install <code>micro-httpd</code>. <u>OR</u>

{{Install_Package|package=
micro-httpd
}}

'''B)''' Run the following commands to install <code>nginx</code>.

{{Install_Package|package=
nginx
}}

==== Step 2: Open Whonix-Workstation Firewall Port ====

On the {{workstation_product_name}}.

{{Firewall Settings Workstation}}

Add.

{{CodeSelect|code=
EXTERNAL_OPEN_PORTS+=" 80 "
}}

Save.

{{Reload_Firewall_ws}}

==== Step 3: Final Notes ====

The procedure is now complete. 

Please note that it may take up to 30 minutes (or thereabouts) until a fresh .onion domain is reachable. Further, accessing <code>127.0.0.1</code> {{Tor_Browser_Local_Connections}}

=== Debugging ===

==== Whonix-Gateway ====

Check permissions.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo ls -la /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/
}}

In case you manually restored the hidden_service keys as root, Tor will fail to start. The folder must be owned by <code>debian-tor</code>. In that case, fix the permissions.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo chown debian-tor:debian-tor /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/
}}

==== Whonix-Workstation ==== 

Check if the service is available on <code>127.0.0.1:80.</code>

{{CodeSelect|code=
## Circumventing {{project name}} curl stream isolation wrapper.
{{Curl_Plain}} 127.0.0.1:80
}}

[[{{q_project_name_short}}|{{q_project_name}}]]: In [[{{q_project_name_short}}|{{q_project_name}}]] {{workstation_product_name}}, check if the service is available on Qubes-{{workstation_product_name}} IP, port 80.

{{CodeSelect|code=
## Circumventing {{project name}} curl stream isolation wrapper.
{{Curl_Plain}} $(qubesdb-read /qubes-ip):80
}}

[[{{non q project name short}}|{{non q project name}}]]: In {{workstation_product_name}}, check if the service is available on <code>10.152.152.11:80</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
## Circumventing {{project name}} curl stream isolation wrapper.
{{Curl_Plain}} 10.152.152.11:80
}}

Note: Tor Browser will allow connections to <code>127.0.0.1:80</code> but <u>not</u> to <code>10.152.152.11:80</code>.

== Setup Tips for any Onion Service ==

Please test the example Hidden Webserver above first; this helps in understanding the process in general and will ease debugging. The following material is quoted directly from the [https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en Tor manual]:

<pre>HiddenServiceDir DIRECTORY

Store data files for a hidden service in DIRECTORY. Every hidden service must have a separate directory. You may use this option multiple times to specify multiple services. If DIRECTORY does not exist, Tor will create it. Please note that you cannot add new Onion Service to already running Tor instance if Sandbox is enabled.</pre>


<pre>HiddenServicePort VIRTPORT [TARGET]

Configure a virtual port VIRTPORT for a hidden service. You may use this option multiple times; each time applies to the service using the most recent HiddenServiceDir. By default, this option maps the virtual port to the same port on 127.0.0.1 over TCP. You may override the target port, address, or both by specifying a target of addr, port, addr:port, or unix:path. (You can specify an IPv6 target as [addr]:port. Unix paths may be quoted, and may use standard C escapes.) You may also have multiple lines with the same VIRTPORT: when a user connects to that VIRTPORT, one of the TARGETs from those lines will be chosen at random. Note that address-port pairs have to be comma-separated.</pre>

It is difficult to confirm exactly how safe Tor onion services are. Therefore, this section is intended as a repository of relevant facts, quotes and links to provide an estimation -- feel free to add further germane material.

Roger Dingledine, an original developer of Tor, addressed this issue in a 2013 tor-talk mailing list [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-March/027539.html How easy are Tor hidden services to locate?]:

<blockquote>
Hidden services are definitely weaker than regular Tor circuits, a)
because the adversary can induce them to speak, and b) because they stay
at the same place over time. Mostly 'a'.

That said, there are plenty of hidden services out there, and few
stories of people breaking their anonymity by breaking Tor. So they're
not foolproof for sure, but they're also not trivial to deanonymize.

I'll turn it around, and ask "easy compared to what?"
</blockquote>

Roger also [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-March/027544.html added]:

<blockquote>
When you're a Tor client, you only use the Tor network when you choose
to access it (e.g. by trying to fetch a web page). So if the attacker has
some attack that works only a very small percentage of time, they have to
wait for you to initiate connections.

But for a hidden service, they can cause you to initiate a connection just
by visiting the hidden service. And they can do it as often as they want.

See http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#hs-attack06 for the original paper about
this topic (and the reason we implemented entry guards).

And then see http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#wpes12-cogs for a more recent
example. The goal of that paper is to understand how long it takes in
normal operation (with entry guards going offline and being replaced)
before a typical user touches an adversary-controlled guard node. For
simplicity, the paper assumes that you use your guards every minute of
every day for however many weeks or months it takes. A realistic user
doesn't do that, so the paper overestimates the risk. But a realistic
hidden service *would* do that, if the adversary caused it to.

--Roger
</blockquote>

At the time of writing there are no known attacks used in the wild that consistently deanonymize Tor onion services. However, there is a plethora of [[Speculative_Tor_Attacks|Speculative Tor Attacks]] against the ecosystem that have been highlighted in research settings, including those that specifically target the server or client and server in combination. Therefore, Tor processes and anonymity protection might be seriously degraded under specific conditions.

A number of serious onion service concerns <ref>Concerns with v2 onion services included: 
* 80 bit name hash and RSA-1024 sized keys

== Notes about End-to-end Security of Onion Services ==

Hidden services are not really encrypted "end-to-end", they are only encrypted "Tor-to-end" (or "Tor-to-Tor"). The communication between the browser or server and Tor is sent in clear text. This does not really constitute a security issue, as localhost (or Workstation to Gateway on an isolated network), is supposed to be secure. But this does pose some security implications.

Firstly, with onion services alone and no TLS enabled, the adversary only needs to compromise {{gateway_product_name}} to gain knowledge of the content of the connection and the client's identity/location. To compromise the content of the connection, the adversary only needs to compromise either the gateway or the workstation.

With both onion services and TLS enabled, an adversary needs to compromise {{workstation_product_name}} to gain knowledge of the content of the connection. To gain knowledge of the client's identity/location, the adversary would have to compromise {{gateway_product_name}} as well. 

Although it is possible to use onion services and TLS in combination -- that is, https://****************.onion -- there are very few onion services reachable over TLS. For example, DuckDuckGo search engine https://duckduckgo.com/ can be reached over https://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/. But since this only offers benefits to users of {{project name}} (and other Tor gateway implementations), there is little demand. However, it does provide some nice defense in depth because it eliminates a single point of failure.

This does raise the question as to how the TLS certificate can be verified. That is a simple process for private sites where the server and clients know each other; they simply verify it over a pre-shared secure channel, for example a meeting.

In regards to public onion services, certificate authorities previously refused to give out certificates for .onion sites, for example Startssl.com declined because .onion is no .gTLD, see: [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6116 Bug #6116: apply for .onion gTLD at IANA]. However, in DuckDuckGo's case, a certificate has been issued by DigiCert which confirms TLS certificates can be issued for people who can reasonably prove they own a .onion domain. Presumably evidence of domain control may include editing its contents upon their request. Nevertheless, little faith should be placed in certificate authorities, see: [[SSL|Transport Layer Security (TLS)]].

Finally, it should be noted that running onion services with {{project name}} is safer than running Tor and the server software on the same host, because even when misconfigured, there cannot be any IP or DNS leaks (by design).
