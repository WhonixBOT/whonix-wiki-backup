= Introduction =

{{project_name}} is a secure operating system comprised of two virtual machines which are isolated both from each other and the host. This configuration averts many threats posed by malware, misbehaving applications and user error. While {{project name}} protects against many real world threats, <ref>See: [[Security in Real World|Protection Against Real World Attacks]].</ref> it is still possible for skilled adversaries to compromise {{workstation_product_name}} ([[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]]: <code>anon-whonix</code>). 

If a single {{workstation_product_name}} is used for all anonymous activities and is exploited, the attacker gains access to available data and can monitor all online activity. To minimize the impact of a compromise, it is recommended to utilize multiple {{workstation_product_name}} to compartmentalize different identities and/or additional software. Depending on individual preferences and requirements, a second, third ... n<sup>th</sup> {{workstation_product_name}} VM can be created.

== Multiple {{workstation_product_name}} Rationale ==

Different torifed clients can be used in a completely isolated manner with Multiple {{workstation_product_name}}. By compartmentalizing each different identity or client, an attacker can only read the data in the compromised VM. For example, if Tor Browser in VM-1 was compromised it could not read a user's IRC identity in VM-2. <ref>Without using an additional exploit to successfully break out of the infected VM, which is a difficult task.</ref> 

One disadvantage of this configuration is that if the host Internet connection goes offline or Tor on {{gateway_product_name}} (<code>sys-whonix</code>) suddenly fails, then all {{workstation_product_name}} will go offline simultaneously. If multiple Tor clients were running and abruptly stop in unison, a network observer could link these activities to the same person. For instance, a strong correlation is formed if two Tor users in one IRC channel go offline at exactly the same time.

== {{q_project_name}} vs {{non_q_project_name}} ==

[[Qubes|{{q_project_name}}]] is the recommended choice for multiple {{workstation_product_name}} because it is specifically designed for compartmentalization (a.k.a. sandboxing) of multiple running VMs. This provides significant speed and security advantages relative to the traditional Type 2 hypervisor model, where two (or more) {{project name}} VMs are run inside programs like [[VirtualBox]] on top of the host OS. For further information, see: [[Virtualization_Platform_Security#Type_1_vs_Type_2_Hypervisors|Type 1 vs Type 2 Hypervisors]] and [[Qubes/Why_use_Qubes_over_other_Virtualizers|Why use Qubes over other Virtualizers?]]

{{q_project_name}} also has a TemplateBased filesystem which saves time and improves usability compared to {{non_q_project_name}}:

* <u>Centralized Updates:</u> [https://qubes-os.org/doc/glossary/#appvm AppVMs] are based on the corresponding TemplateVM's root filesystem. After updating the TemplateVM, those same updates will be reflected in the root filesystem of every [https://qubes-os.org/doc/glossary/#templatebasedvm TemplateBasedVM]. [[{{non q project name short}}|{{non q project name}}]] users must spend more time in updating each VM individually.
*  <u>Minimal Disk Usage:</u> TemplateBasedVMs require far less disk space than traditional VMs since the AppVM's root filesystem is based on the corresponding template. The AppVM only requires enough disk space to hold user files in the <code>/home</code> directory.
* <u>VM Management:</u> Cloning VMs is a simple two-step process which can be done in Qube Manager. {{non_q_project_name}} requires a multi-step process to clone and configure each VM.

= Safety Precautions =

| text    = While multiple {{workstation_product_name}} are recommended, this is <u>not</u> an endorsement for using them simultaneously!
}}

It is safest to only use one {{workstation_product_name}} at a time and for a single activity. New risks are introduced by running multiple {{workstation_product_name}} at the same time. For instance, if a single {{workstation_product_name}} was compromised, it could potentially perform various side channel attacks to learn about running processes in other VMs, and not all of these can be defeated. Depending on user activities, a skilled adversary might be able to correlate multiple {{workstation_product_name}} to the same pseudonym. Therefore, ideally, shut down all but one {{workstation_product_name}} before using any other {{workstation_product_name}}.

!- scope="row" | Attacks via the shared bridge
|
Multiple workstation VMs are all connected to the gateway using the same virtual bridge; they share an IP subnet. A variety of attacks permit devices sharing a bridge to view or steal one another's traffic, or to impersonate one another at the IP layer. The exact attacks available depend on the specific bridge implementation, but some are always available. At a minimum, VMs sharing a bridge can always trivially detect one another, and determine one another's local IP addresses on the bridge, simply by watching broadcast traffic like ARP and IPv6 neighbor discovery.

The snooping and impersonation vulnerabilities are particularly dangerous because the communication between the Tor process running on the gateway and the client programs running on the workstation is neither encrypted nor cryptographically authenticated. Connections are made either using the (cleartext) SOCKS5 protocol or using Tor's transparent connection proxying feature. Even if the actual application data are encrypted, DNS lookups and circuit creation data are always sent in the clear. A workstation VM that intercepts another workstation's bridge traffic is in a position to know the destinations of all outgoing connections over Tor from that other workstation, as well as the timing and volume of traffic sent over each such connection. It may also be possible to intercept Tor control traffic generated by the "new identity" button. If the user sends cleartext data at the actual application layer, then hostile VMs are in a position to steal those data as well.

In effect, none of the workstation VMs receives Tor's core protections with respect to the other workstation VMs. Although many things in each workstation may be protected against the other workstations, for Tor purposes all of the VMs effectively share the same compartment.

This could be mitigated by providing each workstation VM with a separate virtual bridge and a separate virtual interface on the gateway VM. The gateway configuration should also be reviewed to make sure that the gateway isn't routing unnecessary traffic between the workstations at the IP layer.

{{Anchor|qubes}}
== {{q_project_name}} ==

Using multiple {{workstation_product_name}} is simple in [[Qubes|{{q_project_name}}]].
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Create an additional AppVM based on the {{workstation_product_name}} template (<code>{{whonix-ws}}</code>) and give it a distinctive name.

'''2.''' Confirm the new AppVM is using <code>sys-whonix</code> as its [https://qubes-os.org/doc/glossary/#netvm NetVM].

If creating a new AppVM is unfamiliar, follow this link for step-by-step instructions: [[Qubes/Create_Workstation_AppVMs|Create {{project name}} Workstation AppVMs]].

'''3.''' If the AppVM is connected to any Whonix-Gateway other than <code>sys-whonix</code>, apply the following instructions. <ref>
Sparing users from needing to change this setting requires upstream Qubes feature request [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/4117 way to find out name of gateway from witin VM - qubesdb-read /qubes-gateway-name] or [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/5253 qrexec feature request: send this over qrexec to the NetVM I am connected to / sys-whonix hardcoded / sys-whonix unexpected autostart] to get implemented.
