}}

= Introduction =
Does your computer or notebook have a [[microphone]]? You could have a built-in one, but never noticed it. In most cases it is recommended to disable your microphone for security reasons. If your Whonix-Workstation ever gets compromised by malware, an adversary could eavesdrop through your microphone.

External microphones should be unplugged for ultimate security. If your microphone is built-in and you decide to disable your microphone, you can check the BIOS see find out if the microphone can be disabled. Removing built-in microphones may be a bit more difficult, but if you have the skills to remove it, go for it.

By default, unfortunately microphones connected to your host are available to virtual machines such as the Whonix-Workstation.

If you want to make internet calls ([[Voip|Voice over IP] (VoIP]) or use the microphone for other reasons inside Whonix-Workstation, use [[Multiple_Whonix-Workstations]] and use the microphone only in selected, not all Whonix-Workstations. Unplug your microphone after use.

For [[VoIP|VoIP]] purposes you may need to enable audio passthrough capability for your respective hypervisor. This page documents the steps on getting audio working on [[Download|supported platforms]].

= KVM =
By default the virtual sound device emulates a line-in/line-out, meaning microphone passthorugh to guests is enabled by default if it is enabled on the host. For security, it is good practice to keep the microphone on the host disabled if you are not using it.
