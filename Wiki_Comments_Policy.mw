= Limitations on Free Speech on Whonix Website =
Yes, we have a free speech problem in Whonix forums, comments, wiki. I have no problem admitting that. None of the forum moderators so far nor me have been censoring opinions because of disagreements.

The offtopic sub forum in Whonix forum was closed a while ago. I wanted to keep politics and other controversy opinions out. There was too much volume for me to follow it all, and some opinions were so controversial, I would have had to consult a lawyer if they may stay online.

Now a bit politics is back in this sub forum. And I was even participating myself as a very politically interested person.

I am comfortable leaving all opinions raised in above thread as is. The volume and controversy was little enough.

You might have noticed I have been using 'I' and 'me' a lot in this post. Why is it up to me? Legal reasons. Too much too ask to

a) work on Whonix, AND

b) at the same time provide a free speech platform, which requires

* staying up to date on developments related to international legislation,
* following all posts (if I am even obliged to do that, which is another hard legal question depending on jurisdiction)
* being ready to defend any opinion that I don’t hold myself in court,
* having money for legal battles,
* and being personally liable when court cases are lost.

And so far, no other person or organization wanted to take that burden of liability either.

Complaining about <i>limitations on free speech in Whonix forums</i> is easy since demanding an <i>everything goes</i> policy is easy. Demanding Whonix forums to be a free speech platform may be a result of not having noticed the regulatory changes, legal challenges and penalties over the last few years.

If you or your organization is ready to be identifiable and sign a binding contract of taking responsibility for user posted opinions in Whonix forums, I am more than happy to watch the experiment. It’s unlikely to happen though. The purpose of this chapter is to deflect the demand of <i>everything goes</i> back to the requester. This would ideally result in actual research on the legal challenges of running a free speech platform.
