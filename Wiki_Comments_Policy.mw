}}

Purpose:

* Allow quick and dirty feedback by users.
* Anyone can comment. Even anonymous users. Unless it becomes a burden due to spam.
* Posting (unencoded) external links may be restricted to discourage spam.

Non-purposes:

* User support. These will be redirected to the forums.
* [[Limitations_on_Free_Speech_on_Whonix_Website|A free speech platform.]]
* Immortalization. A posted comment doesn't grant the right to remain there forever.
