== Adding Terms to the GPL ==
Many projects added additional permissions and/or additional terms to the GPL. The following PDF shows many examples:

GPL-3-with-idsoft-extra-terms

Summary:
Id software added several terms to the software license, ammending the GPL-3.

This is NOT in a contradiction to the GPL-3 §10, as GPL-3 §7 explictly allows
to override the paragraphs idsoft does.

This was also discussed on debian-legal with the same conclusion:
The extra terms are comptabile with the GPL. (Doom3BFG has the same license)
See https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2014/10/msg00003.html

Analysis after initial reject:

GPL V3 in §10:
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the> > rights
granted or affirmed under this License.

However, §7, "Addtional Terms" has an exception to this: (I'll quote
only the important sections here):

  7. Additional Terms.
  (...)
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
  add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright
  holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with
  terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
    or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions
    of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient,
    for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly
    impose on those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further
  restrictions” within the meaning of section 10.

The last quoted sentence makes it clear that other changes except the
ones from the list in §7 are "further restrictions" and implicitly says
"those in the list are not". For now a) is the important one.

idsoft utilizes this exceptions and overrides §15 and §16 with their
own versions, but IMHO above shows that they are free to do that.

There is also nothing in that point a) that disallow to say "I
completely manage §15 and §16 myself, thus the original ones are void",
so saying "Replacement of Section 15.  Section 15 of the GPL shall be
deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:" and
accordingly "2. Replacement of Section 16.  Section 16 of the GPL shall
be deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:"
is OK too.

Looking at idsofts §15, this is a just a rephrased version of the GPL
15, with nothing special in it. [1]

§16 idsoft is also not really fancy rewrite of GPL §16. [2]

There is also a third point in idsofts' additional terms: [3]
3. LEGAL NOTICES; NO TRADEMARK LICENSE; ORIGIN.
but that is also covered but the exceptions in the GPL,
bullet poinst b), c), d) and e)

And finally, point 4 in idsofts addendum, INDEMNIFICATION
is covered by bullet point f). [4]

Bottom line, I'm sure that this license is perfectly fine and distributeable.

License: GPL-3+-with-idsoft-extra-terms
 There are two very similar license grants for code originating
 from the single-player or multiplayer engine, which are grouped
 together as one license for the purposes of this copyright file.
 The "additional terms" are among those allowed by the GPL version 3,
 section 7; they are the same as in the Doom 3 source code on which
 dhewm3 and rbdoom3bfg are based.
 .
 You can find the GPL license text on a Debian system under
 /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-3.
 .

This page [[Dev/Licensing]] (note the <code>/[[Dev]]</code>, which stands for development contained in the link) is not {{project name}} licensing page. This page contains licensing discussion and references. {{project name}} licensing page can be found here: [[{{project name short}}:Copyrights]]

The license for software created by {{project name}} is the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version with additional terms applicable per GNU GPL version 3 section 7.

The additional terms are based on the [[#rbdoom3bfg|Doom 3 license]] which is Debian refers to as <code>GPL-3+-with-id-software-additional-terms</code>, which is Debian [https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines DFSG] (The Debian Free Software Guidelines) approved and which is therefore suitable for Debian <code>main</code>. {{project name}} made applied minimal changes to it:

* Rewrite <code>The Doom 3 BFG Edition GPL Source Code</code> to the more common <code>this program</code> which is used throughout the GPL.
* License name changed from <code>GPL-3+-with-id-software-additional-terms</code> to more generic (without company name) <code>{{license_name}}</code>.
* <ref>
<s>Added a "[https://www.fsf.org/news/canonical-updated-licensing-terms trump clause]", in other words, any conflicts or disputes between the additional terms and the GPLv3 shall be resolved in favor of the GPLv3 by adding <code>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License</code> (as mentioned in [https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#v3Notwithstanding GPL FAQ]) at the beginning of the additional terms.</s>

Later removed due to misconception. The clause actually did the opposite of the intention. Also the clause isn't needed, because, see below.
</ref>

The risk of inventing a nonfree license is non-existing. This is because:

* Quote GPLv3: <blockquote>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term.</blockquote>
* So it's not possible to add "further restrictions" then what GNU GPL version 3 section 7 allows.

== enclosing EULA ==
* outer EULA
* outer level EULA
* enclosing EULA

* <code>concentric copyright</code>
** Meaning packages with Permissive licensing will have their terms overridden by a distributor's EULA while the opposite applies for GPL2. GPL3 allows certain reservations to comply with local liability and warranty laws and can coexist with a EULA crafted for this purpose.

== Compilation Copyright ==
What is a "Compilation Copyright".

Quote https://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2017/ancillary-rights.html (by Eben Moglen & Mishi Choudhary)

<blockquote>
“Compilation” as a term of art in US copyright law means “a work formed by the collection and assembling of preexisting materials or of data that are selected, coordinated, or arranged in such a way that the resulting work as a whole constitutes an original work of authorship.”2 Compilations, under US law, includes “collective works,” which are defined as “a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology, or encyclopedia, in which a number of contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole.”3
</blockquote>

Coincidentally or not, in computer programming <code>compilation</code> also means the "the translation of <code>source code</code> into (a) <code>binary</code> (or <code>object code</code>)". It's been argued that <code>compilation</code> of <code>source code</code> into <code>binary</code> <code>software packages</code> creates a <code>compilation copyright</code> [[#Ubuntu|such as by Ubuntu]]. See also [[Dev/Operating_System#Ubuntu_Legal_Issues|Ubuntu Legal Issues]].

Quote https://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2017/ancillary-rights.html (by Eben Moglen & Mishi Choudhary)

<blockquote>
The process of making distributions involves no small amount of additional programming. Maintenance to package code, works specific to the distribution, activities and projects specifically produced or sponsored by the distribution-maker—all comprise a significant fraction of the software in major distributions. These activities produce their own independent copyrights in many instances. These work- or package-level copyrights form another part of the web of ancillary rights held by distribution makers.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
For example, a distribution containing thousands of packages may be licensed overall by a EULA that conditions use on acceptance of a warranty disclaimer.
</blockquote>

== License of Source Code vs License of Binary ==
The source code may be under a different license than the binary. This has been demonstrated for example by Microsoft demonstrated with its product [https://code.visualstudio.com VS Code]. This is well described in blog post [https://carlchenet.com/you-think-the-visual-studio-code-binary-you-use-is-a-free-software-think-again/ You Think the Visual Studio Code binary you use is a Free Software? Think again.].

Similar examples include:

* Chrome (nonfree) vs Chromium (Free)
* Oracle JDK vs OpenJDK

Quote https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html

<blockquote>
[...] These binaries are not free software even if the source code they are compiled from is free. [...]
</blockquote>

== Binary License ==
Above examples demonstrate, that:

* <code>binary license</code> is a real thing,
* that from the license of the source code not necessarily follows the license of the binary, and therefore
* the license of the binary should be explicitly defined.

== Binary License Scope ==
Examples might include:

* [[#Compilation Copyright|Compilation Copyright]]
* Compiled/binary packages (such as <code>deb</code> packages by a distributor.
* Virtual Machine appliances such <code>ova</code> images.
* Virtual Machine images such <code>vdi</code>, <code>vmdk</code>, <code>qcow2</code> or <code>raw</code> images.
* ISO images.
* Archives such as <code>tar.xz</code>.
* Programs compiled as an executable program.
* Object code.

== {{project name}} ==
GPLv3 talks about <code>object code</code>. It doesn't mention <code>binary</code>. Most users don't know what <code>binary</code> is and don't even have a concept of <code>source code</code>. However, <code>object code</code> is even more obscure for users. Therefore it was being considered to call it <code>WHONIX_OBJECT_CODE_LICENSE_AGREEMENT</code>.

Decided on <code>WHONIX_BINARY_LICENSE_AGREEMENT</code> since we sometimes call our downloads <code>binary images</code> and <code>binary</code> is a common term for compiled packages. Binary is a little less obscure than object code.

For considerations - which however are not part of the license - why this license was chosen, see [[#{{project_name}}]].

= Arguments against Inclusion of Freedom Software created by Trolls =
Microsoft acted in ways that can be be described as copyright troll / patent troll. <ref>
https://web.archive.org/web/20080312014935/http://www.showusthecode.com/
</ref> Most software developed by Microsoft is nonfree. Some software by Microsoft is Freedom Software. It is reasonable to expect being a trap to use it.

Quote https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=898259#17 Ian Jackson

<blockquote>
For example, it might promote interfaces that Microsoft prefer, over
interfaces that Microsoft deprecate; or it might promote
edit-a-template coding workflows (and the templates might have
unfortunate licences).

It might encourage intergration with other Microsoft products.

Even if we do an assessment of these kinds of questions, and find that
right now they are not a problem, Microsoft can of course change
things later.  The bait-and-switch business strategy is common.

In summary, I am uncomfortable with Microsoft as an upstream in this
context.  Of course, none of this necessarily contradicts Debian's
formal standards, so a final decision would rest with
maintainers/sponsors within Debian.
</blockquote>

Patrick agrees with this, however it looks difficult to codify cautioning against such trickery strategies by policy.

Quote VS Code License:

<blockquote>
You may not everse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for the software except
</blockquote>

Patrick finds that sketchy.

They allegedly <ref>
As per [https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/60#issuecomment-161792005 this comment], quote:

<blockquote>
Here's how it works. When you build from the vscode repository, you can configure the resulting tool by customizing the product.json file. This file controls things like the Gallery endpoints, “Send-a-Smile” endpoints, telemetry endpoints, logos, names, and more.

When we build Visual Studio Code, we do exactly this. We clone the vscode repository, we lay down a customized product.json that has Microsoft specific functionality (telemetry, gallery, logo, etc.), and then produce a build that we release under our license.
</blockquote>
</ref> only are customizing the product.json file for custom things like branding and telemetry, which seems the right way to go about it. But if these differences are minor, and if the source code they're building from is Freedom Software anyhow, why forbid analytics of the binary?

** <blockquote>A third problem with bare licenses is that they may be revocable by the licensor. Specifically, a license not coupled with an interest may be revoked. The term interest in this context usually means the payment of some royalty or license fee, but there are other more complicated ways to satisfy the interest requirement. For example, a licensee can demonstrate that he or she has paid some considerationa contract law term not found in copyright or patent lawin order to avoid revocation.</blockquote>
