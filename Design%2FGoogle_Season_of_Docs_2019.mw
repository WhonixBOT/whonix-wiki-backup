=== Welcome to the Whonix project's Season of Docs wiki! ===


= Introduction =


The Whonix project has applied for the Google Season of Docs 2019. We are very excited for the opportunity to work with some great tech writers from the greater open-source community. For this first ever Season of Docs, we some fun and exciting project ideas waiting for you. So lets start this first Season of Docs off with a bang. 

== Whonix Overview ==

If you are interested in privacy you may have heard of the Whoninx project. If Whonix is unfamiliar to you, we'll give you a brief overview to get you started. 

Whonix is a free and open-source desktop operating system (OS) that is specifically designed for advanced security and privacy. Based on Tor, Debian GNU/Linux and the principle of security by isolation. Whonix addresses common attack vectors while maintaining usability. Online anonymity and censorship circumvention is attainable via fail-safe, automatic and desktop-wide use of the Tor network, meaning all connections are forced through Tor or blocked. 

Whonix uses an extensively reconfigured Debian base which is run inside multiple virtual machines (VMs) on top of the host OS. This architecture provides a substantial layer of protection from malware and IP leaks. Applications are pre-installed and configured with safe defaults to make them ready for use with minimal user input. The user may install custom applications or personalize their desktop without fear of information leaks that could lead to de-anonymization. Whonix is the only actively developed OS designed to be run inside a VM and paired with Tor.

= Project Ideas =

Before submitting your project idea be sure you have a solid understanding of the problem and solution the software provides. We encourage individuals to push themselves outside their comfort zone, this is how you'll grow as a writer, so don't be afraid to challenge yourself. For the best chance of a successful Season of Docs project its important that you have maximum fun, so choose a project idea that you find exciting.

Do you have a project idea that would make a big impact on our project? We want to hear your project proposal, don't be shy!

Improving how we write documentation is an never ending process. If you have an hour to spare, this video is well worth the time.

'''Project Name:''' Document installation and setup of the new security focused Hardened Debian Linux Distribution.


'''Description:''' Hardened Debian is a new and exciting desktop OS developed by the Whonix project. Unlike Whonix anonymity distribution, this OS does not force network traffic through Tor. Initial documentation will focus on Hardened Debian inside VirtualBox with other platforms documented in the future. Hardened Debian targets beginners to advanced Linux users with a focus on educating first time Linux users with the skills needed to stand on their own two feet. 

This project will focus on core documentation for Hardened Debian and with learning areas for first time Linux users. 

Documentation can be broken up into these areas.  

'''1.''' Overview 

'''2.''' Download: VM image and VirtualBox.(tutorial)

'''3.''' First steps: Setup/config inside VirtualBox (tutorial)

'''4.''' Learning area(s): Basic information to get new user started with Linux.
 
* Terminal/Cli
* sudo
* Text editors
* Directory structure
* File system navigation
* File permissions 
* Man pages
* Create files/directories
* Misc (ls, cat, less)
* ?

Due to the Debian trademark policy a new name must be found for Hardened Debian Linux. Think of a catchy names and include that in your project proposal!

'''Project Name:''' Refactor "Combining Tunnels with Tor" tutorials.


'''Description:''' Whonix documents multiple configurations to combine tunnel-links (VPN, SSH, proxies, JonDonym) with Tor. The docs are broken into an introduction and required knowledge page and the different pages containing the configuration tutorials. While the information in documented is accurate there are long standing issues that have lead to a disproportionately high number of support requests for tunnel-link configurations.

* Related information is not localized on a single page.
* Visual aids (Waring Boxes ) are large in number and very intrusive.
* Educational/required information is mixed with tutorials causing confusion.
* Tutorial steps are not clearly defined. 
* Excessive use of identical templates. Example: Edit with root rights.
* Excessive multiple choices configuration options causing information overload.
* VPN configuration example uses provider not available to all users.

For this project each specific tunnel-link configuration will become standalone documentation.

* Each tunnel-link page will contain its own required knowledge.
* Centralize content for each tunnel-link configuration.
* Specific warnings (do nots) will be migrated to individual pages. (New idea for non-intrusive warnings?)
* Tutorials can be simplified by reformatting, removing both excess content and templates.
* New VPN configuration examples for each page.

'''Project Name:''' Refactor Whonix in VirtualBox tutorial for fist time Linux users.

'''Description:''' For many users in our community Whonix in VirtualBox was their first experience with a Linux distribution. This can be quite a culture shock for anyone accustomed to using an OS such as Windows. Tasks that might seem simple to an experiences Linux user, such as interacting with the terminal and changing file permissions can lead to a frustrating experience. While our current tutorials walks users through Whonix set up, it does not sufficiently educate our "new to Linux" users with the skills they need to stand on their own to feet. Moreover, excessive content in some areas leads to information overload which causes confusion and frustration.  

Each step in the tutorial should be clear and well defined with simplicity trumping all other approaches. Integrate new learning areas which educate beginners in the key areas they need to utilize a Linux distribution effectively and with confidence. 

* Remove and/or relocate excess content  
* Simplify formatting: Remove excessive red text.  
* Define goals clearly. Each step should have a single purpose.
* Document learning areas for new Linux users.
** Man pages
** File system navigation
** File system permissions
** ?
