Secure downloading of files is a complex subject and the potential security implications are poorly understood by most users.

Whonix users will frequently want to download files from the Internet in order to achieve desired aims. Unfortunately, resorting to the simple wget command is ill-advised, because it is [https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-wget/2012-07/msg00015.html buggy]. For example, if users do not force a request to use SSL encryption, wget can [https://stackoverflow.com/a/38835162 fail silently]. Even when SSL is enforced with a command line option, this can [https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/html_node/HTTPS-0028SSL002fTLS_0029-Options.html break interoperability with some sites] that use self-signed, expired or invalid certificates. Users could potentially ignore certificate verification warnings and proceed with downloads where the site's authenticity is in question.

To provide greater security when downloading, Whonix has implemented a scurl script. This invokes the usage of [https://packages.debian.org/jessie/curl curl] with the following additional command line parameters:

* <code>--tlsv1.2 --proto =https</code> to enforce strong encryption.
* <code>--remote-name</code> to simplify naming conventions for downloaded files.
<br />
Scurl is not vulnerable to [https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/41988/how-does-sslstrip-work SSLstrip]. This is a man-in-the-middle attack which forces a user's browser to communicate with the adversary in plain-text over HTTP (poisoning the download).

Unfortunately, scurl is mostly only available in Whonix and the command will generally not work in other distributions. To use scurl, simply run (replace "httpsURL" with the actual file location).

{{CodeSelect|code=
scurl httpsURL
}}

In all cases, users should avoid downloading files over plain HTTP.
