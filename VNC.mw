Make sure it's encrypted / authenticated, because VNC by default is unencrypted / unauthenticated.

* Perhaps by tunneling VNC through [[SSH]].
* Or by running VNC through a [[Onion Services|Tor Onion Service]].
* Or both, for stronger encryption and authentication.

Beware of keyboard keystroke and computer mouse based deanonmization as explained under [[Surfing Posting Blogging]].
