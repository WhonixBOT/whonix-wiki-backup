At a minimum, check the connection is encrypted / authenticated, because VNC by default is unencrypted / unauthenticated. Possible methods:

* Perhaps by tunneling VNC through [[SSH]]; or
* Running VNC through a [[Onion Services|Tor Onion Service]]; or
* Using both SSH and an Onion Service, for stronger encryption and authentication.

Beware of stylometry, keystroke and mouse fingerprinting anonymity risks as outlined in the [[Surfing Posting Blogging]] chapter.
