{{Should I be concerned}}

== Detection of System Changes ==

If trivial changes are noticed on your system -- such as a duplicate desktop icon -- this is not evidence of a hack or leak. Similarly, if warning or error messages appear that are difficult to understand, in most cases there is no need for panic. If something unexpected occurs such as the appearance of a "htaccess file in home directory", or graphical glitches emerge in [[Nyx]], then it is more likely a harmless bug and/or usability issue rather than a compromise.

Skilled attackers do not leave such obvious traces of their breach. An infection by tailored malware is more plausible in this scenario and this is virtually impossible to detect by reading random messages in system logs. Even [[Malware_and_Firmware_Trojans#Malware|malware]] that is bought off-the-shelf (malware building toolkits) are unlikely to be discovered by cursory inspections. <ref>Interested readers can verify these claims by researching off-the-shelf malware building toolkits. They are dangerous to install for inexperienced users, but there is a wealth of information online such as screenshots and video tutorials.</ref> [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit Rootkit] technology is no doubt a standard feature of the various programs.

Strange files, messages or other system behavior could feasibly relate to an attacker wanting the user to find something. However, the likelihood of this kind of harassment is considered low. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_kiddie Script kiddies] ("skiddies") are unskilled attackers who uses scripts or programs to conduct attacks on computer systems and networks, most often with juvenile outcomes. For example, they might use programs to remotely control poorly-secured Windows desktops, trolling their victims from an open, forced chat window, opening their DVD drive and so on. It is improbable that skiddies can achieve similar exploits against Linux, Xen or BSD platforms. <ref>It is unclear if script kiddie programs are readily available for attacking non-Windows users.</ref> Sophisticated attackers generally avoid detection, unless the user is unlucky enough to be a victim of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zersetzung Zersetzung] (a psychological warfare technique).

Every forum post and support request requires time that could otherwise be directed to {{project name}} development. Unless there is genuine evidence of a serious and credible problem, there is no need for a new post. Developers and the {{project name}} community at large do not have enough time to explain every message that Linux might report. In most cases, they are not important and outside the control of {{project name}} developers.
