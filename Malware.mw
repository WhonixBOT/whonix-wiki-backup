== The Importance of a Malware Free System ==

Malware has malicious intent and can potentially: <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware</ref>

* View and take snapshots of the desktop.
* Peruse files and folders.
* Gain access to protected data when decrypted.
* Exfiltrate, corrupt or destroy data (particularly financial and personal information).
* Damage operating system functionality.
* Encrypt the contents of a drive(s) and demand payment for decryption ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware ransomware]). 
* Display unwanted advertising.
* Install unwanted software.
* Install persistent [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit rootkits] or [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_(computing) backdoors].
* Track browsing and other behaviour.
* Remotely turn on webcams and microphones.
* Create "zombie" computers which form part of a botnet for spam email, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_denial-of-service DDOS attacks] or the hosting of illicit / illegal material.
* Record everything a user types, sends and receives.

== Targeted Malware vs Off-The-Shelf Malware ==
Targeted malware is the opposite of off-the-shelf malware.

Targeted malware is specifically crafted against a known target to attack a specific system or limited amount of systems only with the goal to avoid detection by avoiding getting installed on too many where qualified people might detect the malware and publish about it.

On other other hand, off-the-shelf malware attempts to spread in bulk against bigger groups or the general public with the goal of taking over as many systems as possible.

== The Utility of Antivirus Tools ==

Antivirus products and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_firewall personal firewalls] are ''not'' drop in solutions for a secure host. Malware can often stay undetected and evade scans, while application level personal firewalls are often circumvented. <ref>https://www.grc.com/lt/leaktest.htm</ref> [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphic_code Polymorphic code] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit rootkits] essentially render antivirus products helpless. <ref>

[https://forums.whonix.org/t/installation-of-antivirus-scanners-by-default/9755 The following paragraph is currently being discussed.]

Antivirus tools are actually worse than useless. In the case of sophisticated and targeted attacks, the antivirus software can serve as a pathway to exploiting a system's kernel, since they almost always run with administration level privileges. <ref>https://theintercept.com/2015/06/22/nsa-gchq-targeted-kaspersky/</ref> Antivirus software also harms privacy by sending system files back to the company servers for analysis.<ref>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2017/10/more_on_kaspers.html</ref> The software also actively conducts man-in-the-middle attacks on secure SSL connections, enabling very sensitive information to be viewed. <ref>https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=978</ref>

== Preventing Malware Infections ==

The optimal scenario is to avoid infection by malware in the first place. Once malicious code has accessed a system, it is next to impossible to contain. Sensible steps include: hardening the operating system, carefully vetting programs and files that are retrieved from the Internet, and using hypervisors (virtualizers) to isolate software that processes untrusted data.

== Detecting Malware Infections ==

Detecting off-the-shelf (standardized) malware is a very hard problem and conceptually a lost cause. If uncustomized malware is widespread enough, then it has a chance of being detected by a technician. Tailored malware might also get detected by a technician, but the likelihood is low unless they are lucky or gifted.

Non-technical users do not have many good options. They can either:

* Spend a few years to rapidly increase their knowledge base of operating systems, network protocols, package analysis, programming, disassembly etc., and then try their luck.
* Pay exorbitant sums to a technician to try and find system malware, even though there is no certainty of success. <ref>The salary costs for a security researcher / malware analyst over an extended period rule this out for most individuals.</ref> <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/document-recovery-procedure-after-compromise/3296/12
</ref>
* Or seek the voluntary assistance of a technician to find malware, if they are both a high value target and have a reasonable rationale for why they are likely compromised. <ref>Only a select group of people fall into this group, for instance, whistleblowers targeted and infected by tailored viruses. Experts might be located who are willing to conduct analysis pro bono; later publicizing their findings for the public benefit.</ref>

== Detection of System Changes ==

If trivial changes are noticed on your system -- such as a duplicate desktop icon -- this is not evidence of a hack or leak. Similarly, if warning or error messages appear that are difficult to understand, in most cases there is no need for panic. If something unexpected occurs such as the appearance of a "htaccess file in home directory", or graphical glitches emerge in [[Nyx]], then it is more likely a harmless bug and/or usability issue rather than a compromise.

Skilled attackers do not leave such obvious traces of their breach. An infection by tailored malware is more plausible in this scenario and this is virtually impossible to detect by reading random messages in system logs. Even [[Malware_and_Firmware_Trojans#Malware|malware]] that is bought off-the-shelf (malware building toolkits) are unlikely to be discovered by cursory inspections. <ref>Interested readers can verify these claims by researching off-the-shelf malware building toolkits. They are dangerous to install for inexperienced users, but there is a wealth of information online such as screenshots and video tutorials.</ref> [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit Rootkit] technology is no doubt a standard feature of the various programs.

Strange files, messages or other system behavior could feasibly relate to an attacker wanting the user to find something. However, the likelihood of this kind of harassment is considered low. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_kiddie Script kiddies] ("skiddies") are unskilled attackers who uses scripts or programs to conduct attacks on computer systems and networks, most often with juvenile outcomes. For example, they might use programs to remotely control poorly-secured Windows desktops, trolling their victims from an open, forced chat window, opening their DVD drive and so on. It is improbable that skiddies can achieve similar exploits against Linux, Xen or BSD platforms. <ref>It is unclear if script kiddie programs are readily available for attacking non-Windows users.</ref> Sophisticated attackers generally avoid detection, unless the user is unlucky enough to be a victim of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zersetzung Zersetzung] (a psychological warfare technique).

Every forum post and support request requires time that could otherwise be directed to {{project name}} development. Unless there is genuine evidence of a serious and credible problem, there is no need for a new post. Developers and the {{project name}} community at large do not have enough time to explain every message that Linux might report. In most cases, they are not important and outside the control of {{project name}} developers.
