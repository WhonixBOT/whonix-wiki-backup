= Introduction =
== Basic ==
The Anon Connection Wizard application helps users in censored Internet environments connect to the Tor network via a [[Bridges|Tor Bridge]] and/or a proxy. 

Users are prompted with questions about their network environment, like whether they live in a censored area. This information is then used by the program to generate the most suitable Tor configuration possible. This file is placed:

* in {{Gateway product name}}: <code>/usr/local/etc/torrc.d/40_tor_control_panel.conf</code>,
* other Linux distributions: <code>/etc/torrc.d/40_tor_control_panel.conf</code>.

== Anon Connection Wizard vs Tor Launcher ==
Anon Connection Wizard shares several similar functions with the current Tor-launcher, but the latter is considered to be "upstream" <ref>Upstream refers to the originator of the component being discussed.</ref> of the former. As a consequence, Anon Connection Wizard developers are trying to maintain code compatibility with the latest version of Tor-launcher and collaborate closely in Tor Launcher's design and development process. 

Despite this, both applications actually have very different use cases. The current implementation of Tor-launcher relies heavily on Tor Browser (which is based on Firefox), but not all Tor users are Tor Browser Bundle users. Many people still prefer to run core Tor with different torified applications ("system Tor users"), including all {{project name}} users. This group may prefer Anon Connection Wizard because it does not rely on Tor browser, and almost all dependencies have already been packaged in Debian.

== Anon Connection Wizard vs {{project name}} Setup Wizard ==
For safety reasons, {{project name}} does not automatically connect to the public Tor network when it starts for the first time. Users are currently guided by Anon Connection Wizard on the first run, which has replaced {{project name}} Setup Wizard. The primary benefit of Anon Connection Wizard is that it allows the user to also configure a Tor Bridge or a proxy before connecting to Tor.

= Configure Tor Bridges =
Anon Connection Wizard currently offers three different types of bridges by default: {{Code2|obfs3}}, {{Code2|obfs4}}, and {{Code2|meek-azure}}. <ref>As at May 2018, [https://blog.torproject.org/domain-fronting-critical-open-web domain fronting has been pulled by both Google and Amazon], meaning the {{Code2|meek-google}} and {{Code2|meek-amazon}} pluggable transports will no longer work.</ref> <ref>https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/19715</ref> <ref>https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/26098</ref>

== History ==
Anon Connection Wizard was originally developed by troubadour as part of the {{project name}} Project. Some screenshots of the old version can be found in [https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-connection-wizard-bridge-wizard-tor-launcher-clone/1714 this {{project name}} blog post ]. Anon Connection Wizard was further developed by iry under a [https://forums.whonix.org/t/gsoc-with-tor-and-whonix-anon-connection-wizard/4266 Google Summer of Code project]. The development process is ongoing and there are future plans to integrate Anon Connection Wizard into the [https://forums.whonix.org/t/tor-controller-gui-tor-control-panel-testers-wanted/5444 Tor Controller GUI].
