== Introduction ==
=== Basic ===
anon-connection-wizard is a python-based application that help users in different Internet environment connect to the Tor network. Specifically, anon-connection-wizard can help users connection to the Tor network with a Tor [[Bridges]], or/and a proxy. It will ask users questions about their network environment, like whether they live in censored areas. And then, it will generate a file called anon-connection-wizard.torrc in the /etc/torrc.d/ directory with the most suitable Tor configurations according to the answers from users.

=== Anon Connection Wizard V.S. Tor Launcher ===
Anon Connection Wizard shares several similar functions with the current Tor-launcher. Tor-launcher has been considered as the upstream of anon-connection-wizard and the anon-connection-wizard developers are trying to closely keep up and collaborate with Tor Launcher's design and development process. 

However, these two applications actually have very different use cases. Currently, the implementation of Tor-launcher heavily relies on the Tor Browser(which is based on Firefox). However, a Tor user does not necessarily be a Tor Browser Bundle user. There are still a large number of people we call system Tor users who would like to run core Tor with different torified applications. And these people (including Whonix users) may prefer anon-connection-wizard because it does not rely on Tor browser and almost all of its dependencies have already been packaged into Debian.

=== Anon Connection Wizard V.S. Whonix Setup Wizard ===
At least in Whonix14, when Whonix starts for the first time, it won't automatically connect to the public Tor network, which is beneficial for safety reasons. Users are guided by the Whonix Setup Wizard, which is automatically started. The limitation of Whonix Setup Wizard in terms of Tor network configuration is that it actually is not able to help you to configure a Tor Bridge or a proxy before connecting to the Tor.

In the future, Anon Connection Wizard will either replace to or be integrated into Whonix Setup Wizard.
