| text       = anon-connection-wizard requires Tor v0.3.1 or above to properly work. If necessary, install a later [[Security_Guide#Tor_Versioning|Tor version]] in Whonix before proceeding. <ref>Arm - Tor Controller specifies the current Tor version in operation. At the time of writing, the stable Whonix repository supports Tor v0.3.2</ref>

=== Basic ===
anon-connection-wizard, firstly available in Whonix 14, is a python-based application that helps users in different Internet environments connect to the Tor network. Specifically, anon-connection-wizard assists in connecting to the Tor network via a [[Bridges|Tor Bridge]] and/or a proxy. It prompts the user with questions about their network environment, like whether they live in a censored area. Based on this information the program then generates the most suitable Tor configuration possible, which is saved in a file called {{Code|40_anon_connection_wizard.torrc}}. The file will be placed in the ''/usr/local/etc/torrc.d/'' directory in Whonix, and for other Linux distributions it resides in the ''/etc/torrc.d/'' directory.

=== Anon Connection Wizard vs Tor Launcher ===
anon-connection-wizard shares several similar functions with the current Tor-launcher. Tor-launcher is considered as "upstream" <ref>Upstream refers to the originator of the component being discussed.</ref> of anon-connection-wizard. As a consequence, the anon-connection-wizard developers are trying to maintain code compatibility with the latest version of Tor-launcher and collaborate closely in Tor Launcher's design and development process. 

Despite this, both applications actually have very different use cases. Currently, the implementation of Tor-launcher heavily relies on the Tor Browser (which is based on Firefox). However, a Tor user will not always be a Tor Browser Bundle user. A large number of people still prefer to run core Tor with different torified applications ("system Tor users"), including all Whonix users. This cohort may prefer anon-connection-wizard because it does not rely on Tor browser and almost all dependencies have already been packaged into Debian.

=== Anon Connection Wizard vs Whonix Setup Wizard ===
For safety reasons, Whonix 14 and later releases will not automatically connect to the public Tor network when it starts for the first time. Users are currently guided by the Whonix Setup Wizard, which is automatically started on the first run. Whonix Setup Wizard's primary limitation is failing to help the user configure a Tor Bridge or a proxy before connecting to Tor.

In the future, anon-connection-wizard will either replace or be integrated into Whonix Setup Wizard.

== Configure Tor Bridges ==
anon-connection-wizard currently offers four different types of bridges by default: {{Code2|obfs3}}, {{Code2|obfs4}}, and {{Code2|meek-azure}}. <ref>As at May 2018, [https://blog.torproject.org/domain-fronting-critical-open-web domain fronting has been pulled by both Google and Amazon], meaning the {{Code2|meek-amazon}} pluggable transport will no longer work.</ref>

== Development ==
=== History ===
anon-connection-wizard was originally developed by troubadour as part of the Whonix Project. Some screenshots of the old version can be found in [https://www.whonix.org/blog/connection-bridge-wizard this Whonix blog post ]. anon-connection-wizard was developed by iry under a [https://www.whonix.org/blog/anon-connection-wizard Google Summer of Code project]. The development process is ongoing.
