|description=Get Whonix's OpenPGP signing key. Verify Whonix Downloads and/or Source Code.
}}
= Introduction =

Since all Whonix releases are signed with the same key, you will not have to verify the key every time and the trust you might progressively build in it will be built once and for all. Still, you will have to verify the signatures of the images every time you download a new release.

This page is strongly related to the [[Trust]] page.

= Download the key =
1. Download Patrick Schleizer's (adrelanos') OpenPGP key. <html><a class="link-https" download href="/patrick.asc">patrick.asc</a></html>

2. Store it as patrick.asc.

3. Import the key:

<pre>
gpg --import patrick.asc
</pre>

4. Verify the key using this fingerprint:

<pre>
gpg --fingerprint 916B8D99C38EAF5E8ADC7A2A8D66066A2EEACCDA
</pre>

Should show:

<pre>
pub   4096R/2EEACCDA 2014-01-16 [expires: 2015-01-16]
      Key fingerprint = 916B 8D99 C38E AF5E 8ADC  7A2A 8D66 066A 2EEA CCDA
uid                 [ unknown] Patrick Schleizer <adrelanos@riseup.net>
sub   4096R/0x3B1E6942CE998547 2014-01-16 [expires: 2015-01-16]
