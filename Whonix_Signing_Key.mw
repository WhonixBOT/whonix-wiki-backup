= Introduction =

Since all Whonix releases are signed with the same key, it is unnecessary to verify the key every time a new release is announced. Trust in the key might gradually increase over time, but cryptographic signatures must still be verified every time a new release is downloaded. 

This page is strongly related to the [[Trust|Placing Trust in Whonix]] page.

<!--
EDITORS NOTES:
- Not recommending 'scurl': Because these instructions are done on the host. Perhaps by users that are not yet Whonix users. 'scurl' is not available to them.
- Not recommending curl: Because it may not be installed on their host. Perhaps Windows users are looking at these instructions.
- Instructions target regular users. Not from-source-builders.

{{gpg_init}}

'''1.''' Download [[Patrick Schleizer]]'s (adrelanos') [[OpenPGP]] key.<br />
{{Code2|<u>'''{{#widget:Key_Patrick}}'''</u>}}

'''2.''' Store the key as {{Code2|~/patrick.asc}}.

'''3.''' Check fingerprints/owners without importing anything.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --keyid-format long --with-fingerprint patrick.asc
}}

'''4.''' Verify the output.

The output should be identical to the following. 

<pre>
pub  4096R/8D66066A2EEACCDA 2014-01-16 Patrick Schleizer <adrelanos@riseup.net>
      Key fingerprint = 916B 8D99 C38E AF5E 8ADC  7A2A 8D66 066A 2EEA CCDA
sub  4096R/3B1E6942CE998547 2014-01-16 [expires: 2021-04-17]
sub  4096R/10FDAC53119B3FD6 2014-01-16 [expires: 2021-04-17]
sub  4096R/CB8D50BB77BB3C48 2014-01-16 [expires: 2021-04-17]
</pre>

'''5.''' Import the key.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --import patrick.asc
}}

The output should confirm the key was imported.

<pre>
gpg: key 2EEACCDA: public key "Patrick Schleizer <adrelanos@riseup.net>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1)
</pre>

''If the Whonix signing key was already imported in the past'', the output should confirm the key is unchanged.

<pre>
gpg: key 2EEACCDA: "Patrick Schleizer <adrelanos@riseup.net>" not changed
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:              unchanged: 1
</pre>

If the following message appears at the end of the output.

<pre>
gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found
</pre>

Analyze the other messages as usual. This extra message does not relate to the Whonix signing key itself, but instead usually means the user has not created an OpenPGP key yet, which is of no importance when verifying virtual machine images.

'''6.''' Advanced users can check [[#Web of Trust|Web of Trust]] further below for better security.

'''7.'''  Complete the Whonix verification steps. 

If verifying Whonix images, navigate to the relevant verification page below to finish the process: 
* [[Verify_the_virtual_machine_images_using_Linux|In Linux: Ubuntu, Debian, Whonix etc. using KGpg]]
* [[Verify the_virtual_machine_images_using_the_command line|In Linux on the Command Line]]
* [[Verify_the_virtual_machine_images_using_Windows|In Windows]]
* [[Verify_the_virtual_machine_images_using_Mac|In macOS]]

= Advanced Users =
== Web of Trust ==
A few people have signed [[Patrick Schleizer]]'s (adrelanos') OpenPGP key in [[OpenPGP#The_OpenPGP_Web_of_Trust|The OpenPGP Web of Trust]].

Jan Dittberner <ref>http://www.dittberner.info/de/content/jan-dittberner</ref> ({{Code2|Debian Developer}}) <ref>https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=Jan+Dittberner</ref> signed Patrick's key. So did intrigeri (Tails developer, {{Code2|Debian Developer}}); Peter Palfrader ({{Code2|Debian Developer}}); Richard King; and Michael Carbone (accessnow.org).

Users relying on Debian or one of the many Debian derivatives (like Ubuntu) already trust apt-get, the APT repository of the relevant distribution. This means the Debian keyring can be installed as a trusted source for obtaining Jan's, intrigeri's or Peter's key, to check their signature on Patrick's key.

[[Update]] the package lists.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}

Install the Debian keyring.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install debian-keyring
}}

Extract a signer's key from the Debian keyring and import it into your own keyring. Here is an example using Jan's key.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/debian-keyring.gpg --armor --export B2FF1D95CE8F7A22DF4CF09BA73E0055558FB8DD {{!}} gpg --import
}}

Optionally try to establish a better trust path to the signer by checking signatures on the signer's key.

Check signatures on Patrick's key.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --check-sigs 916B8D99C38EAF5E8ADC7A2A8D66066A2EEACCDA
}}

The output of the above command should show signatures on Patrick's key, which should include the signer's signature.
