|description=Get Whonix's OpenPGP signing key. Verify Whonix Downloads and/or Source Code.
}}
= Introduction =

Since all Whonix releases are signed with the same key, you will not have to verify the key every time and the trust you might progressively build in it will be built once and for all. Still, you will have to verify the signatures of the images every time you download a new release.

This page is strongly related to the [[Trust]] page.

<!--
EDITORS NOTES:
- Not recommending 'scurl': Because these instructions are done on the host. Perhaps by users that are not yet Whonix users. 'scurl' is not available to them.
- Not recommending curl: Because it may not be installed on their host. Perhaps Windows users are looking at these instructions.
- Instructions target regular users. Not from-source-builders.

{{gpg_init}}

1. Download [[Patrick Schleizer]]'s (adrelanos') [[OpenPGP]] key:<br />
{{Code2|<u>'''{{#widget:Key_Patrick}}'''</u>}}

2. Store it as {{Code2|patrick.asc}}.

3. Check fingerprints/owners without importing anything.

<pre>
gpg --with-fingerprint patrick.asc
</pre>

4. Verify it shows the following. 

<pre>
pub  4096R/2EEACCDA 2014-01-16 Patrick Schleizer <adrelanos@riseup.net>
      Key fingerprint = 916B 8D99 C38E AF5E 8ADC  7A2A 8D66 066A 2EEA CCDA
sub  4096R/CE998547 2014-01-16 [expires: 2016-10-05]
sub  4096R/119B3FD6 2014-01-16 [expires: 2016-10-05]
sub  4096R/77BB3C48 2014-01-16 [expires: 2016-10-05]
</pre>

5. Import the key.

<pre>
gpg --import patrick.asc
</pre>

6. Advanced users can check [[#Web of Trust]] below for better security.

7.  Don't forget to head back to the verification pages to finish the process (if that's where you're coming from): 
* [[Verify_the_virtual_machine_images_using_Linux|For Linux: Ubuntu, Debian, Whonix, etc. using kgpg]]
* [[Verify the_virtual_machine_images_using_the_command line|For Linux: using the command line]]
* [[Verify_the_virtual_machine_images_using_Windows|For Windows]]
* [[Verify_the_virtual_machine_images_using_Mac|For Mac]]

== Web of Trust ==
A few people signed [[Patrick Schleizer]]'s (adrelanos') OpenPGP key in [[OpenPGP#The_OpenPGP_Web_of_Trust|The OpenPGP Web of Trust]].

{{Code2|Jan Dittberner}}<ref>http://www.dittberner.info/de/content/jan-dittberner</ref> ({{Code2|Debian Developer}}<ref>https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=Jan+Dittberner</ref>) signed Patrick's key. So did intrigeri (Tails developer, {{Code2|Debian Developer}}); Peter Palfrader ({{Code2|Debian Developer}}); Richard King; Michael Carbone (accessnow.org).

If you are a user of Debian or many Debian derivatives, such as Ubuntu, you already trust apt-get, the APT repository of your distribution. So you can install Debian keyring to have a trusted source to obtain Jan's, intrigeri's or Peter's key, to check their signature on Patrick's key.

Install the Debian keyring.
<pre>
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install debian-keyring
</pre>

Extract a signer's key from Debian keyring and import it into your own keyring. Here is an example using Jan's key.

<pre>
gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/debian-keyring.gpg --armor --export B2FF1D95CE8F7A22DF4CF09BA73E0055558FB8DD | gpg --import
</pre>

Optionally try to establish a better trust path to the signer by checking signatures on the signer's key.

Check signatures on Patrick's key.

<pre>
gpg --check-sigs 916B8D99C38EAF5E8ADC7A2A8D66066A2EEACCDA
</pre>

The output of the above command should show signatures on Patrick's key, which should include the signer's signature.
