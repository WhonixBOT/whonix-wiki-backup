|description=Get Whonix's OpenPGP signing key. Verify Whonix Downloads and/or Source Code.
}}
= Introduction =

Since all Whonix releases are signed with the same key, you will not have to verify the key every time and the trust you might progressively build in it will be built once and for all. Still, you will have to verify the signatures of the images every time you download a new release.

This page is strongly related to the [[Trust]] page.

= Download the key =
1. Download Patrick Schleizer's (adrelanos') OpenPGP key. <html><a class="link-https" download href="/patrick.asc">patrick.asc</a></html>

2. Store it as patrick.asc.

3. Import the key:

<pre>
gpg --import patrick.asc
</pre>

4. Verify the key using this fingerprint:

<pre>
gpg --fingerprint 916B8D99C38EAF5E8ADC7A2A8D66066A2EEACCDA
</pre>

Should show:

<pre>
pub   4096R/2EEACCDA 2014-01-16 [expires: 2015-01-16]
      Key fingerprint = 916B 8D99 C38E AF5E 8ADC  7A2A 8D66 066A 2EEA CCDA
uid                 [ unknown] Patrick Schleizer <adrelanos@riseup.net>
sub   4096R/0x3B1E6942CE998547 2014-01-16 [expires: 2015-01-16]
sub   4096R/0x10FDAC53119B3FD6 2014-01-16 [expires: 2015-01-16]
sub   4096R/0xCB8D50BB77BB3C48 2014-01-16 [expires: 2015-01-16]
</pre>

5.  Don't forget to head back to the verification pages to finish the process (if that's where you're coming from): 
* [[Verify_the_virtual_machine_images_using_Linux|For Linux: Ubuntu, Debian, Whonix, etc. using kgpg]]
* [[Verify the_virtual_machine_images_using_the_command line|For Linux: using the command line]]
* [[Verify_the_virtual_machine_images_using_Windows|For Windows]]
* [[Verify_the_virtual_machine_images_using_Mac|For Mac]]

= Web of Trust =
Not many people signed Patrick Schleizer's (adrelanos') OpenPGP key in [[OpenPGP#The_OpenPGP_Web_of_Trust|The OpenPGP Web of Trust]] yet. If you're active in the Free Software community and in the vicinity of Leipzig, Germany, please meet up with Patrick Schleizer for key signing.

{{Code2|Jan Dittberner}}<ref>http://www.dittberner.info/de/content/jan-dittberner</ref> ({{Code2|Debian Developer}}<ref>https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=Jan+Dittberner</ref>) signed Patrick's key.

If you are a user of Debian or many Debian derivatives, such as Ubuntu, you already trust apt-get, the APT repository of your distribution. So you can install debian keyring to have a trusted source to obtain Jan's key, to check his signature on Patrick's key.

Install the Debian keyring.
<pre>
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install debian-keyring
</pre>

Extract Jan's key from Debian keyring and import it into your own keyring.

<pre>
gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/debian-keyring.gpg --armor --export B2FF1D95CE8F7A22DF4CF09BA73E0055558FB8DD | gpg --import
</pre>
