__FORCETOC__

= Versioning Format Conventions =
== Package Version Numbers ==
For individual packages ([https://github.com/Whonix list]) developed under the Whonix umbrella, currently happens as follows. More or less as a custom, as a convention. Not by a finalized master plan.

1) Git commits to specific packages are being made.<br/>
2) Eventually, more git commit to specific packages are being made.<br/>
3) When the maintainer of the package feels, that substantial changes have been made, the {{Code2|debian/changelog}} version will be bumped. This is done using {{Code2|make deb-uachl-bumpup}}, which updates {{Code2|changelog.upstream}} and bumps {{Code2|debian/changelog}} version. The commit message mostly is "{{Code2|bumped changelog version}}". Let's call this state by convention the {{Code2|finalized version commit}} to ease discussing this.<br/>
4) Eventually, if someone requested it or if that version is supposed to become a Whonix ({{Code2|developers-only}}, {{Code2|testers-only}} or {{Code2|stable}}) release, git tags will be signed. <ref>
To ease this, the following commands will be used.

To sign the git tag.
<pre>
make git-tag-sign
</pre>

To verify that the git tag can be verified and that the git hash it points to is itself a signed git commit.
<pre>
make git-verify
</pre>
This is not a requirement, these commands are just shortcuts.
</ref><br/>
5) Development continues. More git commits are being made. At this point, what {{Code2|debian/changelog}} version says will be false, outdated. This is non-ideal, but no one suggested how it could be done any better.<br/>
6) Back to 1).<br/>

If other substantial changes happen, such as if the generic makefile is being updated, this also deserved bumping the version number.

== Whonix Version Numbers ==
The [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix Whonix main source code / build script] references all the individual packages using git submodules. It points to specific git commits of the individual packages.

For ({{Code2|testers-only}} and {{Code2|stable}}) releases, by convention, all packages must point to {{Code2|finalized version commit}}s. <ref>
{{Code2|finalized version commit}} as defined above.
</ref> This is useful so users can refer to package versions as dpkg reports them. (Example: {{Code2|dpkg -l | grep sdwdate}}.) Otherwise it would be version {{Code2|3:0.8-1 + git~5}} or something like that, which would be very unusable. This does not  does not apply for {{Code2|developers-only}} releases, because those are sometimes only used for quick tests to see if the build script still runs through without any issues.
