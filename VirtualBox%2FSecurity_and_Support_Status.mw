VirtualBox does not have a dedicated [[Contribute#Maintainer|maintainer]]. Whonix [[VirtualBox]] support is a remnant from an earlier development period, when no other [[Download|supported platforms]] were supported. VirtualBox images are still built by Whonix lead developer Patrick Schleizer, but development efforts have shifted to [[Qubes]]. 

Although VirtualBox is given less developer attention, grave security issues are unlikely due to the Whonix design. Rudimentary testing of new images and updates is still performed by Schleizer on a Debian host and by [https://forums.whonix.org/users/ego Ego] on a [[Windows]] host. Also, no member of the [[Team|Whonix team]] is currently testing Whonix VirtualBox images on Mac hosts, which means progress on the [https://phabricator.whonix.org/project/view/18/ VirtualBox development task list] will be slow. For these reasons, VirtualBox is considered to provide a "Production" level of security on the Windows and Linux platforms, but has only received an "Experimental" label for macOS.
