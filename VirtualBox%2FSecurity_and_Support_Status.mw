VirtualBox does not have a dedicated [[Contribute#Maintainer|maintainer]]. {{project_name}} [[VirtualBox]] support is a remnant from an earlier development period, when no other [[Download|supported platforms]] were supported. VirtualBox images are still built by {{project_name}} lead developer Patrick Schleizer, but development efforts have shifted to [[Qubes]]. 

Although VirtualBox is given less developer attention, grave security issues are unlikely due to the {{project_name}} design. Rudimentary testing of new images and updates is still performed by Schleizer on a Debian host and by [https://forums.whonix.org/users/ego Ego] on a [[Windows]] host. Also, no member of the [[Team|{{project_name}} team]] is currently testing {{project_name}} VirtualBox images on Mac hosts, which means progress on the [https://phabricator.whonix.org/project/view/18/ VirtualBox development task list] will be slow. For these reasons, VirtualBox is considered to provide a "Production" level of security on the Windows and Linux platforms, but has only received an "Experimental" label for macOS.
