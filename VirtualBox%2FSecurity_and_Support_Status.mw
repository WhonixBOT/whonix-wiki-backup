VirtualBox has no dedicated [[Contribute#Maintainer|maintainer]]. Whonix [[VirtualBox]] support is a leftover from previous times, where no other [[Download|supported platforms]] were supported. Images are still being build by Patrick. But Patrick's focus has now moved to [[Qubes]]. Grave security issues are unlikely due to Whonix's design. Rudimentary testing of new images and updates is being done by Patrick on a Debian host and by [https://forums.whonix.org/users/ego Ego] on a [[Windows]] host. There is no [[Authorship|Whonix team]] member testing Whonix in VirtualBox on Mac hosts. No progress on the [https://phabricator.whonix.org/maniphest/?statuses=open%28%29&projects=PHID-PROJ-b33luubd7a7l5svz2hug#R VirtualBox development task list] should be expected. That's why the [[Download|supported platforms table]] lists VirtualBox in the column 'security' with 'testing' for Linux, Windows and 'experimental' for Mac.
