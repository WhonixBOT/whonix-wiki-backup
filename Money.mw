Readers should understand that anonymous money and payments is a very difficult topic. If outdated or incorrect information is noted, please make direct edits or post in the {{project name}} forums about the issue; improvements are most welcome.

As noted on the [[Documentation|Documentation home page]]:

<blockquote>Whonix is a technological means to anonymity, but staying safe necessitates complete behavioral change; it is a complex problem without an easy solution. The more you know, the safer you can be.</blockquote> 

This is even truer here. Independent research is always recommended to verify the currency of information on this page or to discover if new developments have changed the situation. With greater knowledge, it is expected a stronger level of anonymity is possible.

= Legality =

As noted in the Bitcoin wiki: <ref>https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Anonymity</ref> <ref>Available under a [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 3.0] license.</ref> 

<blockquote>Obviously, using Bitcoin anonymity techniques for the purposes of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/money_laundering money laundering] is illegal, but participating or running schemes which others use for money laundering may also be illegal or at least leave the participant vulnerable to accusations of aiding criminals and terrorists. Bitcoin anonymity techniques involving bitcoins worth large amounts of money (over some value between FJ$1,100 and US$58,000, depending on your jurisdiction) is illegal in most jurisdictions, being in violation of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuring anti-structuring laws].</blockquote>

= Prepaid Cards =

One can buy prepaid cards at a lot of newspaper stands, gas stations and supermarkets anonymously <ref>Please see the comparison about for further comments on how anonymous it is.</ref> using cash. In Germany there is a limit of 100 €/month due to the Gesetz über das Kreditwesen (Banking Act)<ref>http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/kredwg/__25i.html</ref>.

Outlets selling cash codes (paysafecard, Ukash etc.) close to you may be found with the "Find sales outlets" search on the website of the provider. In order to a guarantee a smooth and anonymous deployment of cash codes you should consider the following advices:

* Refrain from checking the cash codes before using them. Use the codes immediately. Due to restrictive security settings cash codes are blocked automatically if they are entered from more than one IP address.
* If your cash code got blocked automatically, you could try writing an email to the support of the provider. If you provide a copy of that cash code they may give you a new one which is unblocked.
