Readers should understand that anonymous money and payments is a very difficult topic. If outdated or incorrect information is noted, please make direct edits or post in the {{project name}} forums about the issue; improvements are most welcome.

As noted on the [[Documentation|Documentation home page]]:

<blockquote>{{project_name}} is a technological means to anonymity, but staying safe necessitates complete behavioral change; it is a complex problem without an easy solution. The more you know, the safer you can be.</blockquote> 

This is even truer here. Independent research is always recommended to verify the currency of information on this page or to discover if new developments have changed the situation. With greater knowledge, it is expected a stronger level of anonymity is possible.

= Legality =

It is obviously illegal to use Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, or other anonymity techniques for the purpose of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering money laundering]:
<blockquote>Money laundering is the illegal process of concealing the origins of money obtained illegally by passing it through a complex sequence of banking transfers or commercial transactions. The overall scheme of this process returns the "clean" money to the launderer in an obscure and indirect way.</blockquote>

Similarly, participating in or running schemes which others use for money laundering may also be illegal or make the participant vulnerable to accusations of aiding criminals or terrorists. <ref>This point was formerly noted in the [https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Anonymity Bitcoin wiki].</ref> Many jurisdictions also place limitations on using Bitcoin (or related) anonymity techniques to hide the source of funds greater than $10,000 - $15,000 because it violates [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuring anti-structuring laws]. <ref>For instance, transactions of more than $10,000 must be reported in the US, with similar thresholds applying in European and other jurisdictions.</ref>

To comply with relevant laws, many cryptocurrency exchanges require users to undergo Anti-Money Laundering and Know-Your-Customer (AML/KYC) checks. This normally involves personal information such as real name, income, occupation and home residence which is linked to bitcoin addresses and later transactions. A number of jurisdictions are also strengthening anti-money laundering laws to prevent cryptocurrencies being used for crime and corruption related activities. <ref>https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Anonymity</ref>

If the reader is in any doubt, {{project name}} is not intended for, nor endorses any anonymous money techniques that violate anti-money laundering or anti-structuring laws. Always abide by relevant laws in your local jurisdiction when using cryptocurrencies and other anonymous money methods.

In Germany there is a limit of 100 €/month due to the Gesetz über das Kreditwesen (Banking Act)<ref>http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/kredwg/__25i.html</ref>.

Outlets selling cash codes (paysafecard, Ukash etc.) close to you may be found with the "Find sales outlets" search on the website of the provider. In order to a guarantee a smooth and anonymous deployment of cash codes you should consider the following advices:

* Refrain from checking the cash codes before using them. Use the codes immediately. Due to restrictive security settings cash codes are blocked automatically if they are entered from more than one IP address.
* If your cash code got blocked automatically, you could try writing an email to the support of the provider. If you provide a copy of that cash code they may give you a new one which is unblocked.
