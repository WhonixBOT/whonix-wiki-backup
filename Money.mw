Readers should understand that anonymous money and payments is a very difficult topic. If outdated or incorrect information is noted, please make direct edits or post in the {{project name}} forums about the issue; improvements are most welcome.

As noted on the [[Documentation|Documentation home page]]:

<blockquote>{{project_name}} is a technological means to anonymity, but staying safe necessitates complete behavioral change; it is a complex problem without an easy solution. The more you know, the safer you can be.</blockquote> 

This is even truer here. Independent research is always recommended to verify the currency of information on this page or to discover if new developments have changed the situation. With greater knowledge, it is expected a stronger level of anonymity is possible.

= Legality =

It is obviously illegal to use Bitcoin, alternative cryptocurrencies, or other anonymity techniques for the purpose of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering money laundering]:
<blockquote>Money laundering is the illegal process of concealing the origins of money obtained illegally by passing it through a complex sequence of banking transfers or commercial transactions. The overall scheme of this process returns the "clean" money to the launderer in an obscure and indirect way.</blockquote>

Similarly, participating in or running schemes which others use for money laundering may also be illegal or make the participant vulnerable to accusations of aiding criminals or terrorists. <ref>This point was formerly noted in the [https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Anonymity Bitcoin wiki].</ref> Many jurisdictions also place limitations on using Bitcoin (or related) anonymity techniques to hide the source of funds greater than $10,000 - $15,000 because it violates [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuring anti-structuring laws]. <ref>For instance, transactions of more than $10,000 must be reported in the US, with similar thresholds applying in European and other jurisdictions.</ref>

To comply with relevant laws, many cryptocurrency exchanges require users to undergo Anti-Money Laundering and Know-Your-Customer (AML/KYC) checks. This normally involves personal information such as real name, income, occupation and home residence which is linked to bitcoin addresses and later transactions. A number of jurisdictions are also strengthening anti-money laundering laws to prevent cryptocurrencies being used for crime and corruption related activities. <ref>https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Anonymity</ref>

If the reader is in any doubt, {{project name}} is not intended for, nor endorses any anonymous money techniques that violate anti-money laundering or anti-structuring laws, facilitates tax evasion, or aids other illegal activity. Always abide by relevant laws in your local jurisdiction when using cryptocurrencies and other anonymous money methods.

= Prepaid Cards =

It is possible to buy prepaid cards at a lot of newspaper stands, gas stations and supermarkets anonymously using cash. <ref>Refer to the comparison tables for information on the degree of anonymity.</ref> However, strict limits are normally imposed; for example, in Germany the Gesetz über das Kreditwesen (Banking Act) means there is an individual limit of 100 Euros per month. <ref>http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/kredwg/__25i.html</ref>

To locate outlets selling cash codes (Paysafecard, Giftcard and so on) in your area, use the "Find sales outlets" search function on the provider's website. To ensure the smooth and anonymous deployment of cash codes, follow this advice:
* Refrain from checking the cash codes before using them and use the codes immediately. Due to restrictive security settings cash codes are blocked automatically if they are entered from more than one IP address.
* If your cash code gets blocked automatically, then try writing an email to the provider's support section. If a copy of the cash code is provided they may give you a new, unblocked one.
