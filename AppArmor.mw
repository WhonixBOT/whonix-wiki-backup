__FORCETOC__

=== Introduction ===
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppArmor AppArmor] profiles. For better security.

=== Installation ===
==== Introduction ====
{{AppArmorProfileWarning}}

The profiles packages are available from the [[Whonix-APT-Repository|Whonix's APT repository]].

It is highly recommend to switch to Whonix's {{Code2|testers}} repository before installing them, because the profiles in the {{Code2|stable}} repository are much older and have some issues. Note, that switching to the {{Code2|testers}} repository would update also other packages from that testers repository unless you know how to avoid this (advanced users only).

Enable Whonix's {{Code2|testers}} repository.

<pre>
sudo whonix_repository
</pre>

In Whonix-Workstation as well as on Whonix-Gateway.

Update your package lists.

<pre>
sudo apt-get update
</pre>

==== If you want to install all of them ====
The easiest way to install all of them. You might end up with a few apparmor profiles for software that you have not installed, but then they don't have any effect, so it does not matter.
<pre>
sudo apt-get install apparmor-profiles-whonix
</pre>

==== If you only want to install specific ones ====

=== Profile Unloading ===

'''Only in case you want to disable an apparmor profile.'''<br />

<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
Once the profile is loaded in the kernel, to remove it to run.

<pre>
sudo aa-disable profile-name
</pre>

This command expect the profile file to be existing. So when the profile file is deleted (manually or after apt-get purge), the only way I know to unload it is rebooting.

Need to know the names of the profiles, have a look above [[#If you only want to install specific ones]].
