[[Qubes-Whonix]] users require some extra instructions for setting up AppArmor. [[Non-Qubes-Whonix]] users can skip this. ({{Non-Qubes-Whonix}})
}}
{{Qubes AppArmor}}

The profiles packages are available from the [[Whonix-APT-Repository|Whonix's APT repository]].

It is highly recommend to switch to Whonix's {{Code2|testers}} repository before installing them, because the profiles in the {{Code2|stable}} repository are much older and have some issues. Note, that switching to the {{Code2|testers}} repository would update also other packages from that testers repository [https://www.whonix.org/old-forum/index.php/topic,1548.0.html unless you know how to avoid this] (advanced users only).

Enable Whonix's {{Code2|testers}} repository.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo whonix_repository --enable --repository testers
}}

In Whonix-Workstation as well as on Whonix-Gateway.

[[Update]] your package lists.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}

==== If you want to install all of them ====
The easiest way to install all of them. You might end up with a few apparmor profiles for software that you have not installed, but then they don't have any effect, so it does not matter.
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install apparmor-profiles-whonix
}}

==== If you only want to install specific ones ====

=== Profile Unloading ===
<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed" style="width:800px">
'''Only in case you want to disable an apparmor profile.'''<br />
Click on expand on the right side.
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
You can view a list of all available profiles here:
{{CodeSelect|code=
ls /etc/apparmor.d/
}}

Once the profile is loaded in the kernel, to remove it to run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo aa-disable /etc/apparmor.d/profile-name
}}

This command expect the profile file to be existing. So when the profile file is deleted (manually or after apt-get purge), the only way I know to unload it is rebooting.

Need to know the names of the profiles, have a look above [[#If you only want to install specific ones]].

=== More Profiles ===
Only as additional inspiration. Profiles by other vendors than Whonix. Unsupported by Whonix developers. Don't bother installing an AppArmor profile for applications that you are not going to use anyhow. For example, it's a waste of time to install the dovecot AppArmor profile if you are never going to use dovecot.

* Debian has packages that you can easily install from Debian's apt repository - https://wiki.debian.org/AppArmor/HowToUse#Enable_.2F_install_more_profiles
* Ubuntu also provides profiles. Not so easily downloadable as package to be installed in Debian. The profiles may or may not differ or compleement from the above. http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~apparmor-dev/apparmor-profiles/master/files/head:/ubuntu/16.04/
