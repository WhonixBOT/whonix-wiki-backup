__FORCETOC__

= Introduction =

According to debian.org: <ref>
https://wiki.debian.org/AppArmor
</ref>

<blockquote>
AppArmor is a Mandatory Access Control framework. When enabled, AppArmor confines programs according to a set of rules that specify what files a given program can access. This proactive approach helps protect the system against both known and unknown vulnerabilities.
</blockquote>

AppArmor provides a number of advantages: <ref>
http://wiki.apparmor.net/index.php/Main_Page
</ref>

* It protects the operating system and applications from external or internal threats, including zero-day attacks.
* "Good behavior" is enforced and it mitigates exploits via unknown application flaws.
* AppArmor security policies define the system resources that individual applications can access, and with what privileges. For instance:
** Network access.
** Raw socket access.
** Read, write or execute file permissions on specific paths.

Some AppArmor profiles for some default applications such as Tor are enforced by default. To see which, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo aa-status
}}

More AppArmor profiles are available for testers.

= Installation =
{{Testers-only}}

It is recommended to use the {{project_name}} [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppArmor AppArmor] profiles which are available for various programs that run in both {{gateway_product_name}} and {{workstation_product_name}}, such as Tor, Tor Browser, Thunderbird and more. The profiles are easy to apply and provide a considerable security benefit.

== Install all AppArmor Profiles ==
=== Installation ===
The easiest method is to install all available AppArmor profiles. This can result in a few profiles being enforced for software that is not installed, but this will not have any adverse impacts.

At time of writing it is not required to change [[Project-APT-Repository|{{project name}} APT repository]].

{{Install Package|package=
apparmor-profiles apparmor-profiles-extra apparmor-profiles-kicksecure
}}

=== Enabling ===
Some profiles in the <code>apparmor-profiles</code> and <code>apparmor-profiles-extra</code> packages are not enforced by default because the Debian maintainers do not believe they are mature enough. <ref>
https://packages.debian.org/buster/apparmor-profiles
</ref>

<blockquote>
apparmor-profiles provides various experimental AppArmor profiles. Do not expect these profiles to work out-of-the-box.

These profiles are not mature enough to be shipped in enforce mode by default on Debian. They are shipped in complain mode so that users can test them, choose which are desired, and help improve them upstream if needed.

Some even more experimental profiles are included in folder <code>/usr/share/apparmor/extra-profiles</code>. 
</blockquote>

To see which profiles are in complain mode (not actually providing protection) and which are in enforce mode (providing actual protection), run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo aa-status
}}

To enable a profile which is currently in complain mode you need to find it in folder <code>/etc/apparmor.d</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
ls /etc/apparmor.d
}}

And then enable. For example.

(The following example is already enforced by default if installed as per above.)

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/home.tor-browser.firefox
}}

It might not be advisable or useful to enable all available AppArmor profiles.

Next see the contents of folder <code>/usr/share/apparmor/extra-profiles</code> to see what other AppArmor profiles are available.

{{CodeSelect|code=
ls /usr/share/apparmor/extra-profiles
}}

If you are using any of these applications, copy the profile over to folder <code>/etc/apparmor.d</code>. Example.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo cp /usr/share/apparmor/extra-profiles/bin.netstat /etc/apparmor.d
}}

And then enable it. Example.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/bin.netstat
}}

}}

Profile for [[Tor Browser]]. Useful in {{workstation_product_name}}. <ref>
Tor Browser is installed by [[Tor Browser#Update Tor Browser|tb-updater]]; the latter is a default {{project name}} application.
</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install apparmor-profile-torbrowser
}}

Profile for the [[HexChat]] client. Useful in {{workstation_product_name}}. (Soon renamed to apparmor-profile-hexchat.)

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install apparmor-profile-xchat
}}

Profile for the [[E-Mail#Mozilla_Thunderbird_with_TorBirdy|Mozilla Thunderbird]] [[E-Mail]] client. Useful in {{workstation_product_name}}. (Soon renamed to apparmor-profile-thunderbird.)

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install apparmor-profile-icedove
}}
</div>
</div>

== Profile Unloading ==

The name of the specific profile to unload must be known in advance; refer to the [[#Install_Select_AppArmor_Profiles|list]] above.

If it is necessary to disable an AppArmor profile, first list those which are available.

{{CodeSelect|code=
ls /etc/apparmor.d/
}}

Or.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo aa-status
}}

Once a profile is loaded in the kernel, it can be easily removed.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo aa-disable /etc/apparmor.d/profile-name
}}

This command expects the profile file to exist, so if it has been manually deleted or removed via apt-get purge, it can only be unloaded by rebooting.

= Common Operations =

== Maintain Tor Browser Functionality ==

Tor Browser upgrades frequently break the {{project name}} AppArmor profile used to contain it. Even when AppArmor-related fixes are confirmed in Phabricator, most often the packages are not made available to {{project name}} stable or even the developer version. This means manual profile fixes are often required until the [[About#{{project_name}}_Version|next {{project name}} version is released]].

If Tor Browser is non-functional with the available AppArmor profile, follow these steps to rectify the problem.
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Open a terminal in {{workstation_product_name}} (<code>{{whonix-ws}}</code>).

<code>{{whonix-ws}}</code> &rarr; <code>Xfce Terminal</code>

'''2.''' List the available AppArmor profiles.

{{CodeSelect|code=
ls /etc/apparmor.d/
}}

'''3.''' Edit the Tor Browser AppArmor profile.

Note: change the name of the file to match whatever version is installed on the system.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudoedit /etc/apparmor.d/home.tor-browser.firefox
}}

'''4.''' Navigate to the {{project name}} Github resource for AppArmor.

The latest git commits can be found [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/apparmor-profile-torbrowser here].

Select <code>Code</code> &rarr; <code>etc/apparmor.d</code> &rarr; <code>home.tor-browser.firefox</code>

Select the <code>Raw</code> button on the right-hand side. <ref>
Otherwise essential profile formatting might break or unwanted content (such as line numbers) might be copied inadvertently, leading to a non-functional profile.
</ref>

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = It is recommended to check the profile does not contain any unexpected content. For greater security, utilize a different viewer and/or retrieve the profile using git and perform git commit gpg verification.
}}

Cut and paste the profile text into the old Tor Browser profile which is open in nano. Save and exit.

'''5.''' Enforce the new Tor Browser profile.

In the command below, change the name of the file to match whatever version is installed on the system. 

In {{workstation_product_name}} (<code>{{whonix-ws}}</code>), run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/home.tor-browser.firefox
}}

'''6.''' Shutdown {{workstation_product_name}} (<code>{{whonix-ws}}</code>).

'''7.''' Restart {{workstation_product_name}} (<code>anon-whonix</code>).

Launch Tor Browser. If everything has been applied correctly, Tor Browser will have full functionality. If the following AppArmor warning appears, it can be safely ignored.

<pre>Profile: /etc/apparmor.d/home.tor-browser.firefox Operation: open Name: /dev/ Denied: r Logfile: /var/log/kern.log For more information, please see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingApparmor</pre>

'''8.''' Manually check AppArmor is correctly running and enforced.

In a terminal, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo aa-status
}}

The output should show the Tor Browser profile is loaded and in enforce mode.
}}

== Correcting Other {{project name}} AppArmor Profiles ==

The same method can be used to resolve other AppArmor problems impacting full functionality of applications in {{project_name}}. For instance, the <code>whonixcheck</code> AppArmor profile previously caused continuous "denied" messages in [[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]]. <ref>
In {{project name}} 13.
</ref> Correcting this issue was quite simple: <ref>
This issue was fixed in the {{project name}} 14 release.
</ref>

# Navigate to the [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{{project_name_short}}/whonixcheck/master/etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.whonixcheck raw, updated whonixcheck profile].
# Replace the existing content in ''/etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.whonixcheck'' with the updated github content, in both TemplateVMs <code>{{whonix-gw}}</code> and <code>{{whonix-ws}}</code>.
# Shut down both TemplateVMs and any running instances of <code>sys-whonix</code> and <code>anon-whonix</code>.
# Restart <code>sys-whonix</code> and <code>anon-whonix</code>.

== Inspecting and Disabling AppArmor Notifications ==

[https://packages.debian.org/stretch/apparmor-notify apparmor-notify] is no longer installed by default. This means desktop notifications will not appear concerning AppArmor denied messages, which are stored in <code>/var/log/kern.log</code>. <ref>
To install it, run: <code>sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install apparmor-notify</code>.
</ref> <ref>
https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-14-debian-stretch-apparmor-related-changes/3563
</ref>

=== Inspect Notifications ===

To inspect relevant logs, run.

{{Open with root rights|filename=
/var/log/kern.log
}}

To show denied AppArmor messages of any age, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo cat /var/log/kern.log {{!}} grep -i DENIED
}}

It is possible to keep watching the file as it is appended. This is useful for reproducing AppArmor denied messages and testing amended profiles.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo tail -f /var/log/kern.log {{!}} grep --line-buffered DENIED
}}

=== Disable Notifications ===

If <code>apparmor-notify</code> is manually installed, then on occasion an application may be functional but AppArmor "denied" messages constantly appear. Rather than updating the relevant AppArmor profile(s), it is possible to disable notifications instead.

In the offending {{project name}} (App)VM, launch Xfce Terminal and run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo killall aa-notify
}}

To revert this change, reboot the VM.

== More Profiles ==
It is possible to utilize profiles by other vendors, but this is unsupported by {{project name}} developers. As a reminder, it is not necessary to install AppArmor profiles for any applications that are unlikely to be used (such as dovecot). Additional options include:

* Debian has packages that can be [https://wiki.debian.org/AppArmor/HowToUse#Enable_.2F_install_more_profiles easily installed via the APT package manager]. 
* Ubuntu also [https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~apparmor-dev/apparmor-profiles/master/files/head:/ubuntu/16.10/ provides profiles]. It is not easy to download these as a package to be installed in Debian. Further, the profiles may or may not differ from (or complement) profiles listed earlier.
