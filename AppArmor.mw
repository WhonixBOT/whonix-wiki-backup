[[Qubes-Whonix]] users require some extra instructions for setting up AppArmor. [[Non-Qubes-Whonix]] users can skip this. ({{Non-Qubes-Whonix}})
}}
{{Qubes AppArmor}}

The profiles packages are available from the [[Whonix-APT-Repository|Whonix's APT repository]].

It is highly recommend to switch to Whonix's {{Code2|testers}} repository before installing them, because the profiles in the {{Code2|stable}} repository are much older and have some issues. Note, that switching to the {{Code2|testers}} repository would update also other packages from that testers repository [https://www.whonix.org/old-forum/index.php/topic,1548.0.html unless you know how to avoid this] (advanced users only).

Enable Whonix's {{Code2|testers}} repository.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo whonix_repository
}}

In Whonix-Workstation as well as on Whonix-Gateway.

Update your package lists.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}

==== If you want to install all of them ====
The easiest way to install all of them. You might end up with a few apparmor profiles for software that you have not installed, but then they don't have any effect, so it does not matter.
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install apparmor-profiles-whonix
}}

==== If you only want to install specific ones ====

=== Profile Unloading ===
<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed" style="width:800px">
'''Only in case you want to disable an apparmor profile.'''<br />
Click on expand on the right side.
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
You can view a list of all available profiles here:
{{CodeSelect|code=
ls /etc/apparmor.d/
}}

Once the profile is loaded in the kernel, to remove it to run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo aa-disable /etc/apparmor.d/profile-name
}}

This command expect the profile file to be existing. So when the profile file is deleted (manually or after apt-get purge), the only way I know to unload it is rebooting.

Need to know the names of the profiles, have a look above [[#If you only want to install specific ones]].
