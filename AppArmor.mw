__FORCETOC__

= Installation =

It is recommended to install the available [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppArmor AppArmor] profiles for improved security on the Whonix platform.

== Introduction ==
{{mbox

| text       = 
Testers only!
}}

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Qubes-Whonix Note]]
| text       =
[[Qubes-Whonix]] users require some extra instructions for setting up AppArmor. [[Non-Qubes-Whonix]] users can skip this section. <ref>{{Non-Qubes-Whonix}}</ref>
}}
<br />
{{Qubes AppArmor}}

The profiles packages are available from [[Whonix-APT-Repository|Whonix's APT repository]].

{{mbox
| type      = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text       = '''Tip:''' It is strongly recommended to switch to the Whonix {{Code2|testers}} repository before installing profiles. The profiles in the {{Code2|stable}} repository are much older and have some issues. Note that switching to the {{Code2|testers}} repository will also update other packages from that same repository unless the user knows how to avoid this. <ref>Broken link: https://www.whonix.org/old-forum/index.php/topic,1548.0.html</ref>
}}


Enable the Whonix {{Code2|testers}} repository.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo whonix_repository --enable --repository testers
}}

In Whonix-Workstation as well as on Whonix-Gateway.

{{Update}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}

== Install all AppArmor Profiles ==
The easiest method is to install all available AppArmor profiles. This can result in a few profiles being enforced for software that is not installed, but this will not have any adverse impacts.
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install apparmor-profiles-whonix
}}

== Install Select AppArmor Profiles ==
<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">
Click on Expand on the right side.
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
Profile for [[Tor Browser]]. Useful in Whonix-Workstation. <ref>Tor Browser is installed by [[Tor Browser#Update Tor Browser|tb-updater]]; the latter is a default Whonix application.</ref>
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install apparmor-profile-torbrowser
}}

Profile for [[Sdwdate|sdwdate]]. <ref>The network [[Dev/TimeSync|time sync]] is installed in Whonix by default.</ref> Useful in Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation.
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install apparmor-profile-sdwdate
}}

Profile for the [[HexChat]] [[Chat]] client. Useful in Whonix-Workstation.
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install apparmor-profile-xchat
}}

Profile for the [[E-Mail#Mozilla_Thunderbird_with_TorBirdy|Mozilla Thunderbird]] [[E-Mail]] client. Useful in Whonix-Workstation.
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install apparmor-profile-icedove
}}

Profile for [[whonixcheck]]. Useful in Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation.
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install apparmor-profile-whonixcheck
}}

Profile for [[VirtualBox]]. This is useful on the host, but there are no documented instructions for this procedure yet. It is also useful if running VirtualBox inside VirtualBox.
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install apparmor-profile-virtualbox
}}
</div>
</div>

== Revert any Whonix Repository Change ==

If AppArmor profiles were installed from the testers repository, reverting to the {{Code2|stable}} repository is recommended.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo whonix_repository --enable --repository stable
}}

Update the package lists.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}

== Profile Unloading ==
<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">
{{mbox
| type      = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text       = '''Tip:''' Only complete these steps to disable an AppArmor profile.
}}
<br />
Click on expand on the right side.
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
To view the list of all available profiles, run.
{{CodeSelect|code=
ls /etc/apparmor.d/
}}

Once the profile is loaded in the kernel, to remove it run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo aa-disable /etc/apparmor.d/profile-name
}}

This command expects the profile file to exist. This means if the profile has been deleted manually or via apt-get purge, it can only be unloaded by rebooting.

The name of the specific profile to unload must be known in advance; refer to the [[#Install_Select_AppArmor_Profiles|list]] further above.

= Common Operations =

== Maintain a Functional Tor Browser ==

Tor Browser upgrades frequently break the Whonix AppArmor profile used to contain it. Even when AppArmor-related fixes are confirmed in Phabricator, most often the packages are not made available to Whonix stable or even the developer version. This means manual profile fixes are required until [[About#Whonix_Version|the next Whonix version is released]].

At the time of writing, Tor Browser is non-functional with the available profile in the repositories. Advanced users can follow these steps to rectify the problem.

'''1.''' Open a terminal in Whonix-Workstation TemplateVM.

<code>Whonix-WS TemplateVM</code> -> <code>Konsole</code>

'''2.''' List the available AppArmor profiles.

{{CodeSelect|code=
ls /etc/apparmor.d/
}}

'''3.''' Edit the Tor Browser AppArmor profile.

Note: change the name of the file to match whatever version is installed on the system.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo nano /etc/apparmor.d/home.*.tor-browser_*Browser.firefox
}}

'''4.''' Navigate to the Whonix Github resource for AppArmor.

The latest git commits can be found [https://github.com/Whonix/apparmor-profile-torbrowser here].

Select <code>Code</code> -> <code>etc/apparmor.d</code> -> <code>home.tor-browser.firefox</code>

Select the <code>Raw</code> button on the right-hand side. <ref>Otherwise essential profile formatting might break, or unwanted content (such as line numbers) might be copied inadvertently, causing the profile to become non-functional.</ref>

{{mbox
| type      = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text       = Users should check the profile text does not contain any unexpected content. For greater security, utilize a different viewer and/or retrieve the profile using git and perform git commit gpg verification.
}}


Cut and paste the profile text into the old Tor Browser profile which is open in nano. Save and exit.

'''5.''' Enforce the new Tor Browser profile.

Note: In the command below, change the name of the file to match whatever version is installed on the system. 

In the Whonix-Workstation TemplateVM, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/home.*.tor-browser_*.Browser.firefox
}}

'''6.''' Shutdown Whonix-Workstation TemplateVM and any running instances of Whonix-Workstation AppVM.

'''7.''' Restart the Whonix-Workstation AppVM.

Launch Tor Browser. If everything has been applied correctly, Tor Browser will have full functionality. If the following AppArmor warning appears, it can be safely ignored.

<pre>Profile: /home/**/tor-browser*/Browser/firefox Operation: open Name: /dev/ Denied: r Logfile: /var/log/kern.log For more information, please see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingApparmor</pre>

To manually check AppArmor is correctly running and enforced, in a terminal run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo aa-status
}}

The output should show the Tor Browser profile is loaded and in enforce mode.

== Correcting Other Whonix AppArmor Profiles ==

Advanced users can follow the same method to resolve other AppArmor problems impacting full functionality of applications in Whonix. For instance, in Whonix 13 the <code>whonixcheck</code> AppArmor profile caused continuous "denied" messages in [[Qubes-Whonix]]. Resolving this was quite simple: <ref>This issue was fixed in the Whonix 14 release.</ref>

* Navigate to the [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Whonix/whonixcheck/master/etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.whonixcheck raw updated whonixcheck profile].
* In <u>both</u> the Whonix-Gateway (<code>{{whonix-gw}}</code>) and Whonix-Workstation (<code>{{whonix-ws}}</code>) TemplateVMs, replace the existing content in ''/etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.whonixcheck'' with the updated github content.
* Shutdown both TemplateVMs and any running instances of <code>sys-whonix</code> and <code>anon-whonix</code>.
* Restart the <code>sys-whonix</code> and <code>anon-whonix</code> AppVMs.

== Inspecting and Disabling AppArmor Notifications ==

From Whonix 14, [https://packages.debian.org/stretch/apparmor-notify apparmor-notify] is no longer installed by default. This means desktop notifications will not appear concerning AppArmor denied messages, which are stored in ''/var/log/audit/audit.log'' <ref>To install it, run: <code>sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install apparmor-notify</code></ref> <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-14-debian-stretch-apparmor-related-changes/3563</ref> <ref>The Debian default location is ''/var/log/kern.log''</ref> 

=== Inspect Notifications ===

To inspect relevant logs, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
kdesudo kwrite /var/log/audit/audit.log
}}

To show denied AppArmor messages of any age, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo cat /var/log/audit/audit.log {{!}} grep -i DENIED
}}

It is possible to keep watching the file as it is appended. This is useful for reproducing AppArmor denied messages and testing amended profiles.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo tail -f /var/log/audit/audit.log {{!}} grep --line-buffered DENIED
}}

=== Disable Notifications ===

If users installed apparmor-notify manually, then some applications may be functional, but AppArmor "denied" messages can constantly appear on the desktop. Rather than updating the relevant AppArmor profile(s), it is possible to disable notifications.

In the offending Whonix (App)VM, launch Konsole and run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo killall aa-notify
}}

To revert this change, reboot the VM.

== More Profiles ==
Users can also utilize profiles by other vendors, but this is unsupported by Whonix developers. It is not necessary to install an AppArmor profile for applications that will not be used. For example, it is unnecessary to install the dovecot AppArmor profile if it will never be run.

* Debian has packages that you can be [https://wiki.debian.org/AppArmor/HowToUse#Enable_.2F_install_more_profiles easily installed from the apt repository]. 
* Ubuntu also [https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~apparmor-dev/apparmor-profiles/master/files/head:/ubuntu/16.10/ provides profiles]. These are not so easy to download as a package to be installed in Debian. The profiles may or may not differ or complement those profiles listed further above.
