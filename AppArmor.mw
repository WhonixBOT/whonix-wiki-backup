__FORCETOC__

=== Introduction ===
The following AppArmor profiles are currently under evaluation with Whonix 9. They are not installable and will not work with Whonix 8.

The profiles packages are available from the Whonix APT repository, using "sudo apt-get install profile-name". Example:
<pre>
sudo apt-get install apparmor-profile-torbrowser
</pre>
See each profile for the detailed command.


=== Profiles ===
* [[AppArmor/VirtualBox|VirtualBox]]
* [[AppArmor/Tor_Browser_Bundle|Tor Browser Bundle (TBB)]]
* [[AppArmor/Icedove|Icedove (with Enigmail)]]
* [[AppArmor/Pidgin|Pidgin (with OTR)]]
* [[AppArmor/XChat|XChat]]
* [[AppArmor/Okular|Okular]]
* [[AppArmor/Gwenview|Gwenview]]
* [[AppArmor/sdwdate|Whonix sdwdate]]
* [[AppArmor/Timesync|Whonix timesync]]
* [[AppArmor/Whonixcheck|Whonix whonixcheck]]


=== Profile Unloading ===
'''Only in case you want to disable an apparmor profile.'''

Once the profile is loaded in the kernel, to remove it to run.

<pre>
sudo aa-disable profile-name
</pre>

This command expect the profile file to be existing. So when the profile file is deleted (manually or after apt-get purge), the only way I know to unload it is rebooting.

=== Wishlist ===
* adrelanos: Whonix-Gateway's [[Dev/CPFP]] (Automatically started as an /etc/init.d service. Used by Tor Browser. Avoids about:tor error message. Fixes Tor Browser's New Identity feature in Whonix. /usr/bin/controlportfilt and /usr/lib/whonix/cpf-tcpserver)
* adrelanos: Whonix-Workstation's /usr/sbin/rinetd (Automatically started as an /etc/init.d service. Used by Tor Browser. Useful to run stock Tor Browser without need to modify proxy settings.)
