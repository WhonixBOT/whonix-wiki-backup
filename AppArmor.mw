|description=AppArmor profiles (Security Hardening) for Whonix and other Linux. TBB, Pidgin, more soon.

__FORCETOC__
= Introduction =
The following AppArmor profiles are currently under evaluation with Whonix 8. When considered sufficiently tested, they will be checked for backward compatibility with Whonix 7.

= Abstractions =
The file is called by some of the profiles and has to be installed prior to the profiles themselves.
* [[AppArmor/abstractions/whonix|abstractions/whonix]]

= Profiles =
* [[AppArmor/VirtualBox|VirtualBox]]
* [[AppArmor/Tor_Browser_Bundle|Tor Browser Bundle (TBB)]]
* [[AppArmor/Icedove|Icedove (with Enigmail)]]
* [[AppArmor/Pidgin|Pidgin (with OTR)]]
* [[AppArmor/XChat|XChat]]
* [[AppArmor/sdwdate|Whonix sdwdate]]
* [[AppArmor/Timesync|Whonix timesync]]
* [[AppArmor/Whonixcheck|Whonix whonixcheck]]

= Wishlist =
* adrelanos: Whonix-Gateway's [[Dev/CPFP]] (Automatically started as an /etc/init.d service. Used by Tor Browser. Avoids about:tor error message. Fixes Tor Browser's New Identity feature in Whonix. /usr/bin/controlportfilt and /usr/lib/whonix/cpf-tcpserver)
* adrelanos: Whonix-Workstation's /usr/sbin/rinetd (Automatically started as an /etc/init.d service. Used by Tor Browser. Useful to run stock Tor Browser without need to modify proxy settings.)

= Additional inspiration =
* Use [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppArmor AppArmor] ([http://wiki.debian.org/AppArmor in Debian]):
