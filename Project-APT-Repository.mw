= {{project_name}} APT Repository Overview =

{{project_name}} currently provides four repository choices:

* <u>{{project_name}} stable APT repository</u>: Recommended for most users. The production level packages focus on providing the most reliable {{project_name}} experience. <ref>If possible, users are requested to run a separate testers-only {{gateway_product_name}} (<code>sys-whonix</code>) and {{workstation_product_name}} (<code>anon-whonix</code>) that has the testers repository enabled. If too few people test {{project_name}}, undiscovered issues might migrate to the stable repository.</ref>
* <u>{{project_name}} stable-proposed-updates APT repository</u>: After testing by a wider audience, these packages migrate to the stable repository. <ref name=rollback>Users are recommended to make a VM clone for this repository just in case it breaks. That way changes can be rolled back if necessary.</ref>
* <u>{{project_name}} testers APT repository</u>: Recommended for testers, since it is only briefly tested by {{project_name}} developers. It could break apt-get during an upgrade, requiring terminal commands to rectify the problem. <ref name=rollback/>
* <u>{{project_name}} developers APT repository</u>: As above, except it includes untested changes. These changes ''may'' eventually migrate to the testers repository there is reasonable certainty that these changes will not break the update system. It is not recommended, unless the user is in touch with the development team.

Due to the {{project_name}} design, a user's security is unlikely to be materially affected by preferring the "beta" (stable-proposed-updates) or "alpha" (testers) repositories over the default stable one. <ref>The terms alpha and beta are avoided because they have generally lost their meaning in the software field; many applications remain in alpha or beta status for years, even though they work perfectly well.</ref>

= Change {{project_name}} APT Repository =

It is easy for users to switch between {{project_name}} repositories.

= Disable {{project_name}} APT Repository =

For [[Trust]] reasons some users may prefer not to use {{project_name}} APT Repository. In that case, it is necessary to  [[Dev/BuildDocumentation|update Debian packages in {{project_name}} from source code]], which is inconvenient.

All Default-Download-Version {{project_name}} variants have the {{project_name}} APT repository enabled. It can be disabled via the GUI or in a terminal with the {{project_name}} repository tool.

| If [[Dev/Build Documentation|{{project_name}} is built from source code]], {{project_name}} APT Repository is not added by default. The only exception is if users [[Template:Build Documentation {{project_name_short}} APT Repository|opt in]] using a build configuration. It is also possible to [[#Verify Disabled {{project_name}} APT Repository|verify]] that it is already disabled.

Users can [[#Verify Disabled {{project_name}} APT Repository|optionally verify]] {{project_name}} APT repository is disabled after this procedure.

== Verify {{project_name}} APT Repository is Disabled ==

To check the {{project_name}} APT repository was successfully disabled, run the following tests.
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Use {{Code2|apt-key}}.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-key finger
}}

This test should not show any {{project_name}}-specific keys, such as [[Patrick Schleizer|Patrick Schleizer's OpenPGP key]].

'''2.''' Check if file <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/{{project_name_short_lowercase}}.list</code> exists. 

If it does not exist, the procedure was successful.

'''3.''' ''Optional:'' conduct additional tests as a precaution. 

The following is not strictly necessary, since the <code>{{project_name_short_lowercase}}_repository</code> tool has never written another sources.list file other than <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/{{project_name_short_lowercase}}.list</code>.

Examine the <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> file. It should not include the {{project_name}} APT Repository.

{{CodeSelect|code=
cat /etc/apt/sources.list
}}

Next examine the </code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/</code> folder as well.

{{CodeSelect|code=
cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*
}}
}}
