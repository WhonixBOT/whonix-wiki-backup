This supposes an advanced threat model; for instance a system where a limited user (user "<code>user</code>") is utilizing a graphical X Window System session that is different from the user with root/sudo permissions (user "<code>admin</code>"). The limited user account may be compromised by [[malware]]. Under many threat models this is already considered catastrophic, since running malware:

* has full access to all user-accessible files
* can view all keyboard inputs and take over login sessions
* may present false information on the screen
* can perform other malicious actions - see: [[Malware#The_Importance_of_a_Malware_Free_System|The Importance of a Malware Free System]]

However, when using multiple (virtual) machines for compartmentalization the harmful impact of malware might not be catastrophic. In that case another goal is to prevent root compromise to help to protect the virtualizer and avoid host compromise, and similarly to avoid hardware compromise.

A broken X Window System can block switching to a virtual console. It logically follows that malware which compromised the X Window System could similarly do that. In this case the <code>SysRq</code> + <code>r</code> combination can take away control from the X Window System. <ref>
Since the Linux kernel takes away the control of the X Window System from the console. Linux kernel has higher privileges than the X Window System.
</ref> This is a safer procedure, otherwise a compromised X Window System could just be simulating a virtual console login prompt in order to sniff a login password to an account with root access. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Login_spoofing login spoofing in Wikipedia]).

<code>SysRq</code> + <code>r</code> (un<code>r</code>aw) can be used in this case to make sure the keyboard is disconnected from the X Window System.
