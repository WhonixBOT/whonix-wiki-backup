{{gateway_product_name}} supports torification of any operating system, including Microsoft Windows and others.

'''''Using a default workstation is easier and provides more Security out of the box!''''' It is your responsibility to get the same security features for a {{custom workstation product name}}, see [[Other_Operating_Systems#Security_Comparison:_{{project_name}}-Download-Workstation_vs._{{custom workstation product name}}|Security Comparison: {{project_name}}-Download-Workstation vs. {{custom workstation product name}}]] at the bottom of the page for details.

Also note that it's strongly discouraged to anonymize VMs that have once connected to the clearnet. It could be the case that they might have leaked an identifier or created some network fingerprint that is still recognizable even when running it with Tor. Using it would unmask your traffic.

= Windows-{{workstation_product_name}} =
== Introduction ==
Microsoft Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10 are known to work behind {{gateway_product_name}}. While it is possible, it is not recommended and only for advanced users. This is because, there are issues with Windows. Those are not {{project name}} issues. {{project name}} developers cannot fix those issues. One issue is, that Windows is closed source. Rather, Windows is affected by [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransparentProxyLeaks Transparent Proxy Leaks] and [[Computer Security Education#Windows Hosts|other issues]]. For more information and depending on your security requirements, read the following chapters.

== Easy ==
{{VM Settings Easy Common}}

'''Configure network.'''

For {{Code2|Windows}} 7 (similar in {{Code2|Windows}} XP): In Control Panel &rarr; Network and Sharing Center: click on "Change adapter settings" Right-click on local area connection > properties In property window: double-click Internet Protocol Version 4, use the following settings:

{{CodeSelect|code=
## increment last octet of IP address on additional workstations
IP address 10.152.152.50

<div class="mw-collapsible-content">

These steps are required to use Tor Browser when operating a [[Other_Operating_Systems|{{Custom workstation product name}}]], specifically a Windows-{{workstation_product_name}}.

'''1.''' Install Tor Browser.

* [[Manually_Downloading_Tor_Browser|Download Tor Browser]] from [http://rqef5a5mebgq46y5.onion/torbrowser/ The Tor Project].
* Verify the download.
* Extract the download.

'''2.''' Use Tor Browser without bundled Tor.

Create a new text file in the folder where Tor Browser was extracted. For example, the file could have the following name.

<pre>
Start TB without Tor.bat
</pre>

Add the following content to that file. <ref>It is necessary to set the <code>SET TOR_SKIP_LAUNCH=1</code> environment variable, then start Tor Browser. The Tor Browser Launcher add-on will detect this, skip the connection wizard and skip launching Tor.</ref>

<pre>
SET TOR_SKIP_LAUNCH=1

"Start Tor Browser.lnk"
</pre>

Save.

'''3.''' Configure network settings.

Start Tor Browser. 

The following links for removing and changing proxy settings do not apply one-to-one for Windows! [[#Remove Proxy Settings|Removal]] of proxy settings is best avoided, while [[#Change Proxy Settings|changing]] proxy settings is a better choice. 

How this is accomplished on Windows is currently undocumented, but user contributions to finish these instructions are most welcome.

'''4.''' Figure out missing instructions.

Missing instructions need to be ported from Linux-specific to Windows-specific, see [[#Configure Tor Browser Settings|{{project_name}}-Linux-Workstation#Tor Browser Settings]].

'''Install FreeBSD and upgrade it'''

This is necessary as freebsd-update or pkg do not support socks.

{{CodeSelect|code=
## Base OS patches as root
root_shell> freebsd-update fetch install 

#Application updates
root_shell> pkg upgrade
}}

You will need a http proxy chained to tor gateway to torify pkg or freebsd-update, else you risk loosing patches.
Use one of privoxy/proxychains/tsocks when using the {{gateway_product_name}}.

Install necessary applications.

{{CodeSelect|code=
root_shell> pkg install privoxy 
}}

After this shutdown the VM.

{{CodeSelect|code=
root_shell> shutdown -p now
}}

'''Change the VirtualBox VM settings'''

Choose the newly created VM (for example: myVM) &rarr; Settings &rarr; System &rarr; Motherboard &rarr; Hardware Clock in UTC

System &rarr; Motherboard &rarr; Pointing Device &rarr; PS/2 Mouse (required so that USB controller may be disabled)

System &rarr; Processor &rarr; Enable PAE/NX if available

Network &rarr; Adapter 1 &rarr; Name (of Internal Network) (Important!): Whonix

(Note: It is {{project_name}}, not whonix. Case sensitive. Capital W.)

USB &rarr; uncheck Enable USB controller

&rarr; OK 

Start VM and proceed to configure the OS inside the VM.

'''Configure network.'''

In your Custom-Workstation. Open a terminal and edit as a privileged user {{Code|/etc/rc.conf}}

You need to configure a single interface, here it is em0, there should not be any other 'ifconfig' statements:

{{CodeSelect|code=
## Increment the octect of IP address for configuring other workstations.
ifconfig_em0="inet 10.152.152.12 netmask 255.255.192.0"

}}

For the address resolution to work. {{Open with root rights|
filename=/etc/resolv.conf
}}

and delete everything, then add

{{CodeSelect|code=
nameserver 10.152.152.10
}}

Restart network service:

{{CodeSelect|code=

}}

Confirm changes by running ifconfig.

== With Static IP ==
'''Preferred!'''

VM settings are the same: attach the network adapter to the internal network named <code>Whonix</code>.

Configure Android x86 to use a static IP. On the Android VM run the following in the Terminal Emulator (tested on Nougat):

{{CodeSelect|code=
su
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
ifconfig eth0 10.152.152.12 netmask 255.255.192.0
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
ip rule add from all lookup main pref 0
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
busybox route add default gw 10.152.152.10
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
ndc resolver setnetdns 100 localdomain 10.152.152.10
}}

Static IP routing and DNS should now be working. Note that [[Tor#ICMP|ping uses ICMP and therefore is unsupported]], so open the browser to check your connection.

The following instructions are user contributed, untested by {{project name}} contributors, and require a DHCP server to be installed on {{gateway_product_name}}. [https://phabricator.whonix.org/T239 {{project name}} contributors have not researched yet, if there is any feature in DHCP servers that would be problematic in the use case of anonymity distributions that use a two machine isolation approach. (Help welcome!)] Maybe there is such a feature, maybe not. If it exists, maybe it could be easily disabled, maybe not. What is the attack surface here: once an attacker has compromised {{workstation_product_name}}, an attempt to exploit the DHCP server on {{gateway_product_name}} could be tried. Worse, maybe DHCP has a feature such as "please tell me the IP address of your upstream router", and that would be your real external IP address and DHCP would answer. To find out if this is actually the case, one would have to read the whole [https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2131.txt DHCP protocol].

VM settings are the same: attach the network adapter to the internal network named '''{{project_name_short}}'''

== KVM ==

It is possible to use [[KVM#DHCP|Libvirt's built-in DHCP functionality]] to safely configure DHCP without running into the traffic leaks privacy concerns discussed above. 

== Other Hypervisors ==

Install a DHCP server package:

{{Install_Package|package=
isc-dhcp-server
}}

Note: It won't start, because it is not configured yet.

{{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
}}

Replace its contents with the following.

<pre>
option domain-name "whonix";
option domain-name-servers 10.152.152.10;
subnet 10.152.128.0 netmask 255.255.192.0 {
        range 10.152.152.12 10.152.152.15;
        option subnet-mask 255.255.192.0;
        option broadcast-address 10.152.191.255;
        option routers 10.152.152.10;
}
default-lease-time 600;
max-lease-time 7200;
</pre>

Save.

Run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo dpkg-reconfigure isc-dhcp-server
}}

and choose '''eth1''' as interface for the DHCP server to run on.

After this the DHCP server on workstation starts properly and the Whonix
Gateway is ready to serve a dynamic IP to the Android x86 {{workstation_product_name}}.

= More security =

Recommendations:

* Verify operating system installation CD, compare with sha256 hash or even better verify the gpg signature, if available.
* Install while the Virtual Machine has no internet connection.
* Set your username to ''user''.
* Disable Internet Time Syncing.
* Set your Time Zone to ''UTC''.
* Set up a static IP.
* In case you want to run more than one {{workstation_product_name}} at the same time, it is recommended reading the Introduction in the [[Multiple {{workstation_product_name_short}}|Multiple {{workstation_product_name}}]] article.
* Read [[Documentation#Basic_Security_Guide| Basic Security Guide]], [[Documentation#Advanced_Security_Guide| Advanced Security Guide]], [[Documentation]] and [[Design]] (which is {{project_name}}-Example-Implementation-Workstation (based on Debian GNU/Linux) specific) and try to apply as much from it to Windows as possible.

----
= Even more security =
== General ==
Recommendations:

* Prevent [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransparentProxyLeaks Transparent Proxy Leaks] by disabling {{gateway_product_name}} Transparent Proxy feature. Instead use your Windows {{workstation_product_name}} behind an [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/IsolatingProxy Isolating Proxy]. See [[Stream Isolation]] for more information and instructions on how to [[Stream Isolation#Better Protection|disable the Transparent Proxy feature]].
* Check your host clock out of band (use a watch or atomic clock).
* Set your host and your Workstation clock to show seconds as well. After booting the {{project_name}}-Windows-Workstation, add a random skew to your clock, maybe +/- 1 to 30 seconds. Optimal values are still under investigation. For reference, see [[TimeSync|{{project name}} Secure And Distributed Time Synchronization Mechanism]], it is {{project_name}}-Example-Implementation-Workstation (based on Debian GNU/Linux) specific, but most information also applies to Windows. Since we are not aware of a tails_htp alternative for Windows, you have to do it manually.

== Conclusion ==
The {{project_name}}-Download-Workstation is already preconfigured with all {{project name}} extra security features.

A {{custom workstation product name}} ''can be made'' (Your responsibility!) as secure as a {{project_name}}-Download-Workstation. If you simply create <ref>Install or use a Live CD/DVD into {{workstation_product_name}}.</ref> a {{custom workstation product name}} it has still ''some'' security advantages, for example full IP/DNS protocol leak protection, but ''not all'', for example it lacks Secure Distributed Network Time Synchronization. The details are listed in the table above.
