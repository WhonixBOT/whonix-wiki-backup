= Introduction =
The Whonix Framework<ref>[[Technical_Introduction#Whonix_Framework]]</ref> supports any operating system.

'''''Using a Whonix-Default/[[Download]]-Workstation is easier and provides more Security out of the box!''''' It's your responsibility to get the same security features for a Whonix-Custom-Workstation, see [[Other_Operating_Systems#Security_Comparison:_Whonix-Download-Workstation_vs._Whonix-Custom-Workstation|Security Comparison: Whonix-Download-Workstation vs. Whonix-Custom-Workstation]] at the bottom of the page for details.

The Whonix-Gateway already supports torification of any operating system, including Microsoft Windows and others. As an transparent or isolating proxy<ref>https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/IsolatingProxy</ref>, see below for more information.

== Introduction ==
XP, Vista and Windows 7 are are known to work behind Whonix-Gateway. While it's possible, it's not recommended and only for advanced users. This is because, there are issues with Windows. Those are not Whonix issues. Whonix developers can not fix those issues. One issue is, that Windows is closed source. Rather, Windows is affected by [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransparentProxyLeaks Transparent Proxy Leaks] and [[Pre Install Advice#Windows Hosts|other issues]]. For more information and depending on your security requirements, read the following chapters.

'''Configure network.'''

For {{Code2|Windows}} 7 (similar in {{Code2|Windows}} XP): In Control Panel -> Network and Sharing Center: click on "Change adapter settings" Right-click on local area connection > properties In property window: double-click Internet Protocol Version 4, use the following settings:

<pre>
IP address 10.152.152.50
Subnet netmask 255.255.192.0
Default gateway 10.152.152.10
Preferred DNS server 10.152.152.10
</pre>

'''Download operating system updates.'''

'''Configure network.'''

In your Custom-Workstation. Open a Terminal and type.

<pre>
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
</pre>

You only need to configure eth0:

<pre>
# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

# The loopback network interface, leave as it is
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
#iface eth0 inet dhcp
iface eth0 inet static
# increment last octet on additional workstations
       address 10.152.152.12
       netmask 255.255.192.0
       #network 10.152.152.0
       #broadcast 10.152.152.255
       gateway 10.152.152.10
</pre>

In your Custom-Workstation. Open {{Code|/etc/resolv.conf}}.

<pre>
sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
</pre>

and delete everything, then add

<pre>
nameserver 10.152.152.10
</pre>

'''Download operating system updates.'''

Debian based Linux, such as Ubuntu:

<pre>
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
</pre>

'''Warning''':<br />
The following instructions are user contributed, untested by Whonix maintainers, and require a DHCP server to be installed on Whonix-Gateway. Whonix maintainers have not researched yet, if there is any feature in DHCP servers that would be problematic in the use case of anonymity distributions that use a two machine isolation approach. Maybe there is such a feature, maybe not. If it exists, maybe it could be easily disabled, maybe not. What is the attack surface here: once an attacker has compromised Whonix-Workstation, an attempt to exploit the DHCP server on Whonix-Gateway could be tried. Worse, maybe DHCP has a feature such as "please tell me the IP address of your upstream router", and that would be your real external IP address and DHCP would answer. To find out if this is actually the case, one would have to read the whole [https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2131.txt DHCP protocol]. [https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,157.0.html Forum discussion]. If you are interested anyway, please click on expand on the right side.
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
VM settings are the same: attach the network adapter to the internal network named '''Whonix'''

Android x86 doesn't seem to support static IPs for Ethernet, so a DHCP server needs to be set up on Whonix Gateway.

Install a DHCP server package:

<pre>
$ sudo apt-get install isc-dhcp-server
</pre>

Note that it won't start, because it's not configured yet

Modify '''/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf''' to look like this:

<pre>

option domain-name "whonix";
option domain-name-servers 10.152.152.10;
subnet 10.152.128.0 netmask 255.255.192.0 {
        range 10.152.152.12 10.152.152.15;
        option subnet-mask 255.255.192.0;
        option broadcast-address 10.152.191.255;
        option routers 10.152.152.10;
}
default-lease-time 600;
max-lease-time 7200;

</pre>

Run

<pre>
$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure isc-dhcp-server
</pre>

and choose '''eth1''' as interface for the DHCP server to run on.

After this the DHCP server on workstation starts properly and the Whonix
Gateway is ready to serve a dynamic IP to the Android x86 Whonix Workstation.

= More security =

Recommendations:

* Verify operating system installation CD, compare with sha256 hash or even better verify the gpg signature, if available.
* Install while the Virtual Machine has no internet connection.
* Set your username to ''user''.
* Disable Internet Time Syncing.
* Set your Time Zone to ''UTC''.
* Set up a static IP.
* In case you want to run more than one Whonix-Workstation at the same time, it's recommended reading the Introduction in the [[Multiple Whonix-Workstations]] article.
* Read [[Security Guide]], [[Documentation]] and [[Design]] (which is Whonix-Example-Implementation-Workstation (based on Debian GNU/Linux) specific) and try to apply as much from it to Windows as possible.

= Even more security =
== General ==
Recommendations:

* Prevent [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransparentProxyLeaks Transparent Proxy Leaks] by disabling Whonix-Gateway's Transparent Proxy feature. Instead use your Windows Whonix-Workstation behind an [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/IsolatingProxy Isolating Proxy]. See [[Stream Isolation]] for more information and instructions on how to [[Stream Isolation#Better Protection|disable the Transparent Proxy feature]].
* Check your host clock out of band (use a watch or atomic clock).
* Set your host and your Workstation clock to show seconds as well. After booting the Whonix-Windows-Workstation, add a random skew to your clock, maybe +/- 1 to 30 seconds. Optimal values are still under investigation. For reference, see [[TimeSync|Whonix's Secure And Distributed Time Synchronization Mechanism]], it's Whonix-Example-Implementation-Workstation (based on Debian GNU/Linux) specific, but most information also applies to Windows. Since we are not aware of a tails_htp alternative for Windows, you have to do it manually.

== Whonix Packages ==
[[Whonix_Debian_Packages|Whonix's Debian Packages]] ([https://github.com/Whonix overview]), such as for example [https://github.com/Whonix/uwt uwt], are available for installation [[Dev/Build_Documentation|from source]] and [[Whonix-APT-Repository|Whonix's apt repository]] ([https://github.com/Whonix/uwt#how-to-install-in-debian-using-apt-get example instructions]). Installation (of some) anonymity/security/privacy/usability related ones of them might be interesting for users of Debian and Debian derivatives.

'''Note, that usage of these package outside of Whonix is untested and there is no maintainer that supports this use case.'''

The current [[Authorship|Whonix team]] has only limited resources and focuses on other priorities. If you have developer skills, would you be interested to [[contribute]] by co-maintaining one or another package for using them outside of Whonix?

== Conclusion ==

The Whonix-Download-Workstation is already preconfigured with all Whonix extra security features.

A Whonix-Custom-Workstation ''can be made'' (Your responsibility!) as secure as a Whonix-Download-Workstation. If you simply create <ref>Install or use a Live CD/DVD into Whonix-Workstation.</ref> a Whonix-Custom-Workstation it has still ''some'' security advantages, for example full IP/DNS protocol leak protection, but ''not all'', for example it lacks Secure Distributed Network Time Synchronization. The details are listed in the table above.
