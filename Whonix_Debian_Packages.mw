{{Anchor|Disadvantage}}
== What is the disadvantage of removing a meta package? ==
Then changes in package dependencies will not be automatically processed by your system when you [[Security_Guide#Updates|upgrade your system]].

For example the {{Code2|anon-workstation-packages-recommended}} meta package depends <ref>{{Code2|Depends:}} field in {{Code2|debian/control}}</ref> on {{Code2|[https://github.com/Whonix/tb-updater tb-updater]}}. When you do not have the {{Code2|anon-workstation-packages-recommended}} package installed, you would not notice if we [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/346 replace] {{Code2|tb-updater}} with [https://github.com/micahflee/torbrowser-launcher {{Code2|torbrowser-launcher}}]. {{Code2|tb-updater}} might become unmaintained, broken or even have unfixed security issues. We'll try to [[Stay Tuned|keep you up to date]] should we deprecate (security relevant) packages. If we do that, you could simply {{Code2|sudo apt-get purge tb-updater}} and consider installing what our meta package recommends as replacement.

See also [[#Technical_Stuff]].

== Which ones are safe to remove? ==
Note the [[#Removal Instructions]] below! When you understood those, feel free to remove the following desktop specific meta packages.

* {{Code2|whonix-shared-desktop}}
* {{Code2|whonix-shared-desktop-kde}}
* {{Code2|whonix-shared-kde-accessibility}}

Also feel free to remove the following meta packages, which contain a list of recommended (as in useful to have, not necessary to have them for some other reason):

* {{Code2|whonix-shared-packages-recommended}}
* {{Code2|whonix-gateway-packages-recommended}}
* {{Code2|whonix-workstation-packages-recommended}}
* {{Code2|whonix-workstation-default-applications}}

== Which packages do Whonix meta packages install? ==
See {{Code2|debian/control}} in Whonix [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-meta-packages anon-meta-packages] source code folder or [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-meta-packages/blob/master/debian/control on github] (choose the correct branch!).

Or use for example.

{{CodeSelect|code=
apt-cache show whonix-workstation-default-applications
}}

== Which packages should never be removed? ==
Do not remove {{Code2|...-dependencies}} packages, unless you really know what you are doing.

* {{Code2|whonix-shared-packages-dependencies}}
* {{Code2|whonix-gateway-packages-dependencies}}
* {{Code2|whonix-workstation-packages-dependencies}}

== Why is package X installed? ==
See developer documentation, packages documentation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/whonix-developer-meta-files/blob/master/package_documentation/Whonix-Shared_packages
* https://github.com/Whonix/whonix-developer-meta-files/blob/master/package_documentation/Whonix-Gateway_packages
* https://github.com/Whonix/whonix-developer-meta-files/blob/master/package_documentation/Whonix-Workstation_packages

== Removal Instructions ==
'''1. Upgrade'''<br />
[[Security_Guide#Updates|Upgrade your system.]]

'''2. Cleanup'''<br />
When you installed and uninstalled some custom packages or dependencies changed in meanwhile, get rid of unneeded dependencies first.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get autoremove
}}

'''3. Uninstall'''<br />
Let's see how for example the [https://github.com/Whonix/uwt {{Code2|uwt}}] package could be uninstalled.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get purge uwt
}}

You will see something like this.

<pre>
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required:
  anon-banned-packages anon-iceweasel-warning gpl-sources-download knetattach-hide power-savings-disable-in-vms poweroff-passwordless rads scurl shared-folder-help swap-file-creator swappiness-lowest tor-ctrl
Use 'apt-get autoremove' to remove them.
The following packages will be REMOVED:
  anon-shared-packages-recommended* uwt* whonix-shared-packages-recommended*
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 3 to remove and 2 not upgraded.
After this operation, 152 kB disk space will be freed.
Do you want to continue [Y/n]? 
</pre>

'''4. Keep'''<br />
Now, there is a small issue. Next time you were to run {{Code2|sudo apt-get autoremove}}, you would also uninstall all packages listed under "{{Code2|The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required:}}". (Such as {{Code2|[https://github.com/Whonix/rads rads]}} and others.) Since you most likely want to keep the other packages which were installed by the {{Code2|anon-shared-packages-recommended}} and the {{Code2|whonix-shared-packages-recommended}} meta packages, mark them as manually installed, so they do not get removed. You can conveniently do this using {{Code2|aptitude}}. <ref>https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/166590/what-is-the-apt-get-equvalent-of-aptitude-keep-all</ref> <ref>
Can we safely mix {{Code2|apt-get}} and {{Code2|aptitude}}? Yes, Raphaël Hertzog, dpkg and Debian Developer said already in 2011 that this is no problem anymore.

<blockquote>
First I want to make it clear that you can use both and mix them without problems. It used to be annoying when apt-get did not track which packages were automatically installed while aptitude did, but now that both packages share this list, there’s no reason to avoid switching back and forth.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo aptitude keep-all
}}

'''5. Done'''<br />
Make sure you understood the [[#Disadvantage]].

== Technical Stuff ==
Technical explanations why stuff is as is. Users can skip this chapter.

The underlying technical issues with meta packages are not caused by Whonix, are general issues Whonix inherited from Debian. Those are also described here:

* http://administratosphere.wordpress.com/2011/11/29/the-metapackage-problem-and-apt-get-autoremove/
* http://tanguy.ortolo.eu/blog/article8/uninstall-meta-package

About meta packages:

<br />
Whonix's build script installs all packages using <code>apt-get --no-install-recommends</code>. <ref>
Function {{Code2|pkg-install-maybe}} in https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/build-steps.d/1700_install-packages#L97.
</ref> The <code>--no-install-recommends</code> option is being used to prevent installation of lots of packages we do not want to install. For example, {{Code2|anon-workstation-default-applications}} {{Code2|Depends: gwenview}}, which {{Code2|Recommends: kamera}}. Without using <code>--no-install-recommends</code>, we would also install {{Code2|kamera}}, which would then pull it's own {{Code2|Depends:}} as well. {{Code2|kamera}} [+ dependencies] would not be useful to have installed by default on Whonix-Workstation. Would cost unnecessary disk space. And there are more examples. We might even end up installing packages by default we do not recommend privacy reasons.

Since we do use the <code>--no-install-recommends</code> option, meta packages such as {{Code2|anon-workstation-default-applications}} must use the {{Code2|Depends:}} field and cannot use the {{Code2|Recommends:}} field. (Since no packages would be installed then.)

Even if we could use and did use {{Code2|Recommends:}} field, new packages added to the {{Code2|Recommends:}} field would not be installed when the meta package that {{Code2|Recommends:}} them gets upgraded. This is because packages listed after the {{Code2|Recommends:}} field only get installed during their initial {{Code2|sudo apt-get install package-name}} installation.

You might notice that even though having said this, {{Code2|anon-meta-packages}}'s {{Code2|debian/control}} file uses the {{Code2|Recommends:}} field anyway. This is not a contradiction. It may be useful for a later [[Dev/Installation_from_Repository|Whonix installation from Whonix repository]] use case.
