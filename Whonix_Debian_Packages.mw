<pre>
whonix-shared-packages-recommended
whonix-gateway-packages-recommended

</pre>

== What other packages do Whonix meta packages install? ==
See {{Code2|debian/control}} in Whonix [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-meta-packages anon-meta-packages] source code folder or [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-meta-packages/blob/master/debian/control on github] (choose the correct branch!).

Or use for example.

<pre>
apt-cache show whonix-workstation-default-applications
</pre>

== Which packages should never be removed? ==
Do not remove {{Code2|...-dependencies}} packages, unless you really know what you are doing.

* whonix-shared-packages-dependencies
* whonix-gateway-packages-dependencies
* whonix-workstation-packages-dependencies
