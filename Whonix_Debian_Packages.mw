= Introduction =

It is safe to run <code>sudo apt-get autoremove</code> so long as the following packages are kept for the {{non q project name short}} or {{q project name short}} platform. In other words, these packages should <u>not</u> be in the list of autoremoved packages.

[[{{non q project name short}}|{{non q project name}}]] XFCE:

* [[{{gateway_product_name_short}}|{{gateway_product_name}}]]: <code>non-qubes-whonix-gateway-xfce</code>
* [[{{workstation_product_name_short}}|{{workstation_product_name}}]]: <code>non-qubes-whonix-workstation-xfce</code>

[[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]]:

* {{gateway_product_name}}: <code>qubes-whonix-gateway</code>
* {{workstation_product_name}}: <code>qubes-whonix-workstation</code>

= Re-install Meta Packages and Safely Run Autoremove =

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' [[Update]] the package lists.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt update
}}

'''2.''' Ensure a proper meta package is installed.

[[{{non q project name short}}|{{non q project name}}]] XFCE:

* {{gateway_product_name}}: {{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt install non-qubes-whonix-gateway-xfce
}}
* {{workstation_product_name}}: {{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt install non-qubes-whonix-workstation-xfce
}}

[[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]]:

* {{gateway_product_name}}: {{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt install qubes-whonix-gateway
}}
* {{workstation_product_name}}: {{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt install qubes-whonix-workstation
}}

'''3.''' Auto remove packages.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt autoremove
}}

'''4.''' Reconfirm a proper meta package is still installed.

Repeat step two.

The procedure of safely running <code>sudo apt autoremove</code> is complete.

= Changed Configuration Files =

Be careful if a message like this appears.

<pre>
Configuration file '/etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.sdwdate'
Configuration file '/etc/apparmor.d/whonix-firewall'
 ==> Modified (by you or by a script) since installation.
 ==> Package distributor has shipped an updated version.
   What would you like to do about it ?  Your options are:
    Y or I  : install the package maintainer's version
    N or O  : keep your currently-installed version
      D     : show the differences between the versions
      Z     : start a shell to examine the situation
 The default action is to keep your current version.
*** whonix-firewall (Y/I/N/O/D/Z) [default=N] ? 
</pre>

For general advice, see: [[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates#Changed_Configuration_Files|Changed Configuration Files]]. A rule of thumb is to select <code>Y</code> or <code>I</code> for packages coming from {{project_name}}, and <code>N</code> for packages coming from other distributions. <ref>Otherwise settings affecting anonymity, privacy and security might be lost.</ref>

As per the previous link, always install configuration file changes for the following {{project_name}} files which are not an exception:

* <code>/etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.sdwdate</code>
* <code>/etc/apparmor.d/whonix-firewall</code>

= Non-Issues =

The following messages are expected and it is safe to autoremove these packages.

  whonix-workstation-default-applications-gui whonix-ws-desktop-shortcuts

! scope="row"| What is the disadvantage of removing a meta package?
| Then changes in package dependencies will not be automatically processed by your system when you [[Security_Guide#Updates|upgrade your system]].

For example the {{Code2|anon-workstation-packages-recommended}} meta package depends <ref>{{Code2|Depends:}} field in {{Code2|debian/control}}</ref> on {{Code2|[https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/tb-updater tb-updater]}}. When you do not have the {{Code2|anon-workstation-packages-recommended}} package installed, you would not notice if we [https://phabricator.whonix.org/T18 replace] {{Code2|tb-updater}} with [https://github.com/micahflee/torbrowser-launcher {{Code2|torbrowser-launcher}}]. {{Code2|tb-updater}} might become unmaintained, broken or even have unfixed security issues. We'll try to [[Stay Tuned|keep you up to date]] should we deprecate (security relevant) packages. If we do that, you could simply {{Code2|sudo apt-get purge tb-updater}} and consider installing what our meta package recommends as replacement.

See also [[#Technical_Stuff]].
{{Anchor|Which ones are safe to remove?}}
|-

! scope="row"| Which meta packages are safe to remove?
| Use apt-cache to see the package description.

* Replace <code>package-name</code> with the package you actually want to install.

{{CodeSelect|code=
apt-cache package-name
}}

It will include either:

* <code>Safe to remove, if you know what you are doing.</code>, or
* <code>Do not remove.</code>

Note the [[#Removal Instructions]] below! When you understood those, feel free to remove the following desktop specific meta packages.
|-

! scope="row"| Which packages do {{project_name}} meta packages install?
| See {{Code2|debian/control}} in {{project_name}} [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/anon-meta-packages anon-meta-packages] source code folder or [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/anon-meta-packages/blob/master/debian/control on github] (choose the correct branch!).

Or use for example.

{{CodeSelect|code=
apt-cache show whonix-workstation-default-applications-gui

== Removal Instructions ==
These are instructions for safe removal of a package (in this example package <code>uwt</code>) which would result in meta package removal without breaking the whole system when next time running <code>sudo apt-get autoremove</code>.

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Upgrade. <br />
[[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates|Upgrade your system.]]

'''2.''' Cleanup. <br />
When you installed and uninstalled some custom packages or dependencies changed in meanwhile, get rid of unneeded dependencies first.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get autoremove
}}

'''3.''' Uninstall. <br />
Let's see how for example the [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/uwt {{Code2|uwt}}] package could be uninstalled.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get purge uwt
}}

You will see something like this.

<pre>
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required:
  anon-banned-packages anon-iceweasel-warning gpl-sources-download knetattach-hide power-savings-disable-in-vms poweroff-passwordless rads scurl shared-folder-help swap-file-creator swappiness-lowest tor-ctrl
Use 'apt-get autoremove' to remove them.
The following packages will be REMOVED:
  anon-shared-packages-recommended* uwt* whonix-shared-packages-recommended*
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 3 to remove and 2 not upgraded.
After this operation, 152 kB disk space will be freed.
Do you want to continue [Y/n]? 
</pre>

'''4.''' Keep. <br />
Now, there is a small issue. Next time you were to run {{Code2|sudo apt-get autoremove}}, you would also uninstall all packages listed under "{{Code2|The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required:}}". (Such as {{Code2|[https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/rads rads]}} and others.) Since you most likely want to keep the other packages which were installed by the {{Code2|anon-shared-packages-recommended}} and the {{Code2|whonix-shared-packages-recommended}} meta packages, mark them as manually installed, so they do not get removed. You can conveniently do this using {{Code2|aptitude}}. <ref>https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/166590/what-is-the-apt-get-equvalent-of-aptitude-keep-all</ref> <ref>
Can we safely mix {{Code2|apt-get}} and {{Code2|aptitude}}? Yes, Raphaël Hertzog, dpkg and Debian Developer said already in 2011 that this is no problem anymore.

<blockquote>
First I want to make it clear that you can use both and mix them without problems. It used to be annoying when apt-get did not track which packages were automatically installed while aptitude did, but now that both packages share this list, there’s no reason to avoid switching back and forth.
</blockquote>

</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo aptitude keep-all
}}

'''5.''' Done. <br />
Make sure you understood the [[#Disadvantage]].

== Technical Stuff ==
Technical explanations why stuff is as is. Users can skip this chapter.

The underlying technical issues with meta packages are not caused by {{project_name}}, are general issues {{project_name}} inherited from Debian. Those are also described here:

* http://administratosphere.wordpress.com/2011/11/29/the-metapackage-problem-and-apt-get-autoremove/
* http://tanguy.ortolo.eu/blog/article8/uninstall-meta-package
* https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=942303

About meta packages:

* https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/developers-reference/best-pkging-practices.html#bpp-meta

{{project name}} build script installs all packages using <code>apt-get --no-install-recommends</code>. <ref>
Function <code>pkg-install-maybe</code> in https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/{{project_name_short}}/blob/master/build-steps.d/1700_install-packages#L97.
</ref> The <code>--no-install-recommends</code> option is being used to prevent installation of lots of packages we do not want to install. For example, <code>anon-workstation-default-applications</code> <code>Depends: gwenview</code>, which <code>Recommends: kamera</code>. Without using <code>--no-install-recommends</code>, we would also install <code>kamera</code>, which would then pull its own <code>Depends:</code> as well. <code>kamera</code> [+ dependencies] would not be useful to have installed by default on {{workstation_product_name}}. Would cost unnecessary disk space. And there are more examples. We might even end up installing packages by default we do not recommend privacy reasons.

Since we do use the <code>--no-install-recommends</code> option, meta packages such as <code>anon-workstation-default-applications</code> must use the <code>Depends:</code> field and cannot use the <code>Recommends:</code> field. (Since no packages would be installed then.)

Even if we could use and did use <code>Recommends:</code> field, new packages added to the <code>Recommends:</code> field would not be installed when the meta package that <code>Recommends:</code> them gets upgraded. This is because packages listed after the <code>Recommends:</code> field only get installed during their initial <code>sudo apt-get install package-name</code> installation.

You might notice that even though having said this, <code>anon-meta-packages</code>'s <code>debian/control</code> file uses the <code>Recommends:</code> field anyway. This is not a contradiction. It may be useful for a later [[Dev/Installation_from_Repository|{{project_name}} installation from {{project_name}} repository]] use case.
