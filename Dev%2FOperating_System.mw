}}

= Operating System =

== Introduction ==
This chapter applies to the host(s), Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation.

''Whonix Example Implementation'' is currently based on Debian. There were development discussions about switching to BSD, Alpine Linux or other secure operating systems.

Whonix can't protect against malicious code inserted into upstream operating system infrastructure. Debian ensures some chain of trust as it requires contributors to sign commits.

== Why don't you use <your favorite most secure operating system> for Whonix? ==
==== Generally ====
Why do you use Debian, and not...

The operating system must have

* acceptable usability
* must be somewhat popular, because only that leads to sufficient public scrutiny and enough available documentation.
* For redistribution of Whonix, there are no legal/trademark issues such as with Ubuntu, see [[#Ubuntu Legal Issues]] chapter below for details.
* Must have a secure operating system updater (package manager), i.e. must not fall through the [https://www.updateframework.com/wiki/Docs/Security#AttacksandWeaknesses TUF Threat Model] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6F7Io2ncN w]). Not having a secure updater is [https://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/11/apple-took-3-years-to-fix-finfisher-trojan-hole/ very dangerous] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6FULk4z8t w]).
* Source based distributions take a long time for upgrading and installation of packages, which users complain about. The same or even better security characteristics can be reached with deterministic (reproducible) builds.

Debian is a good compromise of security and usability.

By the way, this chapter won't only include examples which fall through Whonix's threat model.

==== OpenBSD ====
OpenBSD is recommended against, because it completely falls through the Whonix threat model, see FAQ entry: [[FAQ#Why_aren.27t_you_using_OpenBSD.2C_it_is_the_most_secure_OS_ever.21.21.211.21|Why aren't you using OpenBSD, it is the most secure OS ever!!!1!]]

==== FreeBSD ====
[[FAQ#Why_don.27t_you_use_FreeBSD.2C_which_is_more_secure.3F.21.3F|Why don't you use FreeBSD, which is more secure?!?]]

==== OpenWRT ====
[[FAQ#Why_don.27t_you_use_OpenWRT.2C_which_is_more_secure.3F.21.3F|Why don't you use OpenWRT, which is more secure?!?]]

==== SubgraphOS ====
[[FAQ#Why_don.27t_you_use_SubgraphOS.2C_which_is_more_secure.3F.21.3F|Why don't you use SubgrahOS, which is more secure?!?]]

==== Ubuntu ====
Ubuntu is not used as Whonix-Gateway/Workstation operating system for legal reasons (see below) and was lately negatively perceived due to {{Code2|privacy issues}}<ref>[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/10/privacy-ubuntu-1210-amazon-ads-and-data-leaks Privacy in Ubuntu 12.10: Amazon Ads and Data Leaks]</ref>, so it is recommended against to use it as host operating system as well.

{{Anchor|Switch from Ubuntu to Debian}}
===== Ubuntu Legal Issues =====
Whonix 0.4.4 and above based on Debian. Previously Whonix was based on Ubuntu. From technical perspective, Ubuntu was a good choice, see [[Ubuntu Tips#About_Ubuntu|About Ubuntu]] if you are interested.

The switch was due to Ubuntu Trademark issues, see [http://www.ubuntu.com/aboutus/trademarkpolicy About Ubuntu Trademark]. The terms are long and complicated. Since Whonix's changes are beyond a ''remix'' (as defined by Ubuntu Licensing), Whonix would either to have to ask for a license, which they reserve to revoke. Such a legally insecure state is not acceptable. Or Whonix would have to rebrand Ubuntu. It would be possible in theory, but in practice it would require a lot work to remove all Ubuntu strings. [https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-users/2012-September/263760.html Even new apt mirrors would be required], which is much beyond the manpower of the Whonix project.

Debian is much more Libre without any legal issues. According to Debian project leader Stefano Zacchiroli (in private mail), there are no trademark issues as long as the derivative does not claim to be Debian. This is also clarified in [https://www.debian.org/trademark Debian trademark policy] which is easy to comply with.

Derivatives of Debian are even encouraged to use Debian infrastructure, see [http://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Guidelines Derivatives/Guidelines]. Debian even supports derivatives. There is a lot documentation, see [http://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives Derivatives] and even a [http://lists.debian.org/debian-derivatives/ debian-derivatives mailing list].

==== Mac OS X ====
Mac OS X can not be used for legal reasons. Even if that were not a problem, it is still a proprietary, closed source operating system, We don't like their attitude and how they (not) communicate with the security community. Also see: [https://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/11/apple-took-3-years-to-fix-finfisher-trojan-hole/ Apple Took 3+ Years to Fix FinFisher Trojan Hole].

==== Fedora ====
Fedora yet did '''not''' fall through Whonix's threat model and could be considered as host and future or alternative Whonix-Gateway/Workstation operating system. Also Qubes OS, an operating system focusing on security by isolation, is based on Fedora. Started considering it, help welcome, see [[Dev/Fedora]].

==== Qubes ====
Implemented as [[Qubes-Whonix]].

==== Gentoo / Hardened Gentoo ====
Insecure package manager. Back then bug reports got closed down without much regard.

* https://github.com/Whonix/Gentoo-Port/issues/19 - https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=539954
* https://github.com/Whonix/Gentoo-Port/issues/10 - https://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-portage-dev/message/94425239fcaedcee6c49ef398f12aa85
* https://phabricator.whonix.org/T212#5691
* [gentoo-portage-dev] Security and Comparison of Portage with other Package Managers: https://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-portage-dev/message/bda425ee6c676ec7a6b3c9500a9b00bf
* [gentoo-portage-dev] Portage and Update Security: https://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-portage-dev/message/94425239fcaedcee6c49ef398f12aa85

In this regard, Hardened Gentoo does not differ from Gentoo.

Due to the way these bug reports were handled, Gentoo was removed from the candidates of secure base operating systems.

Why not use a minimal Linux distribution? See [[FAQ#Why_are_the_Whonix_images_so_big.3F|Why are the Whonix images so big?]]
There might be more secure operating systems, such as [http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Hardened_Gentoo Hardenend] [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/hardened/ Gentoo], but in Patrick's opinion mortal users are unlikely to learn how to use them. More paranoids (and others) are welcome to use them for example as host operating system and leave feedback. Patches/ports welcome! <ref>
Examples of usability issues.

<pre>
emerge firefox
* There is NOT at least 4 GiB disk space at "/var/tmp/portage/www-client/firefox-31.5.0/temp"
</pre>
What to do? Increase tmpfs size as per http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Portage_TMPDIR_on_tmpfs.
</ref>

==== Alpine Linux ====
[http://alpinelinux.org/ Alpine Linux] on first sight appears to have interesting security features. <s>But they [http://bugs.alpinelinux.org/issues/1067 don't package Tor yet].</s> Other than that, we didn't look thoroughly into it.

At first sight it looks like alpine's package manager suffers from the same issues as gentoo's. (Being vulnerable to indefinite freeze and downgrade attacks.) [https://phabricator.whonix.org/T212 TODO research]

The question to ask is "Does the package manager pass the TUF Threat Model?"

The Update Framework (TUF) - Attacks and Weaknesses:

* https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/develop/SECURITY.md
* http://www.webcitation.org/6F7Io2ncN

(Made by similar people who created this research:<br />
http://www.cs.arizona.edu/stork/packagemanagersecurity/attacks-on-package-managers.html<br />
which resulted as far as I understand in greatly improved package manager security in many distributions.)

One can ask the TUF people, who are in my experience very friendly and helpful, for their opinion on their mailing list:<br />
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/theupdateframework

==== Arch Linux ====
TODO: Check its package manager security. (See above.)

== About Debian ==
=== General ===
Whonix is based on Debian.

Reasons for being based on Debian:

* stable distribution
* exists for years
* will likely still be around in 10 years
* attempts to sow dissent failed <ref>Debian is Free. Imagine how much money that must cost proprietary competiors from whom not all of them necessarily play by the law.</ref>
* massive architecture support <ref>Not just i386, amd64 and perhaps arm. Should any platform become "evil", Debian as the universal operating system offers options and is most likely to port to new platforms.</ref>
* secure package manager
* As per {{Code2|[http://www.trapkit.de/tools/checksec.html checksec.sh] --kernel}}, reports good kernel protection: GCC stack protector support, enforce read-only kernel data, restrict /dev/mem and /dev/kmem access are all enabled.
* http://snapshot.debian.org, hosted and signed by a trusted third party (Debian) <ref>From perspective of Whonix.</ref>, allows implementation of robust build scripts <ref>Build script won't break due to upstream repository changes.</ref> and [[Verifiable_Builds|Verifiable Builds]]
* [https://packages.debian.org/jessie/config-package-dev config-package-dev] allows creation of robust configuration packages
* [https://packages.debian.org/jessie/grml-debootstrap grml-debootstrap] is a tool that allows creation of bootable raw images
* Debian is working on [https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds ReproducibleBuilds]
* huge knowledgeable community of Debian and their derivative users (stackexchange, debian forums, askubuntu and many more)
* Debian Developers are very approachable at conferences
* Tor has ties to Debian.
* [[#Switch_from_Ubuntu_to_Debian|No legal/trademark issues.]]

{{Anchor|Why is Whonix 8 based on Debian Stable, not Debian Testing?}}

=== Why is Whonix based on Debian Stable, not Debian Testing? ===
* Sometimes severe bugs are introduced in Debian testing, such as the AppArmor [http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=732578 bug], which prevented Tor from starting for everyone until a workaround was applied.
* Sometimes bugs are introduced which break Whonix's build script, such as [http://ml.grml.org/pipermail/grml/2014-January/011546.html this] bug related to mount, which breaks grml-debootstrap and therefore Whonix's build script or [http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=734794 this] kpartx bug.
* Often other disturbing bugs are introduced, such as the grub bug (not able to reproduce and report upstream yet), non-functional VirtualBox Guest Additions or [http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=728399 issues] with shared folders.
* Sometimes packages get entirely removed from Debian testing, such as enigmail wasn't available for a while in Debian testing. This is confusing and constantly creating support requests.
* Too often, too many packages are upgraded (not just security fixes) (costs lots of time to keep up, bandwidth, system load).
* obfs3 (obfsproxy 0.2.3) is [http://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/dists/stable/main/binary-i386/Packages available] again in torproject's repository.
* Quote, [https://www.debian.org/security/faq.html#testing Debian Security FAQ]:
<blockquote>
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged to stay with stable.
</blockquote>
* Debian stable receives security fixes faster than Debian testing. For example, by 12/15/2016 Debian jessie was Debian stable and Debian stretch was Debian testing. [https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2016/msg00316.html CVE-2016-1252] was fixed in Debian stable but not in Debian testing, see [http://www.webcitation.org/6mmY2AWVF Debian security tracker by 12/15/2016].

=== Popularity Contest ===
The Debian ''popularity-contest'' (popcon) package does not get installed on Whonix. Installing it gets prevented by the [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-meta-packages/blob/master/debian/control#L324 anon-banned-packages] package.

[http://popcon.debian.org/README popcon readme] | [http://popcon.debian.org/FAQ popcon faq] | [http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=popularity-contest popcon bugs] | [http://lists.alioth.debian.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/popcon-developers popularity contest mailing list] | [http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/popcon-developers/2012-October/002172.html popularity contest mailing list: Drop atime and ctime for privacy reasons possible?]

Some privacy considerations and reasons why it is not installed:

* The connection would obviously need to go over its own Tor circuit (stream isolation). At the moment popcon tries to go through http and if it fails (no internet connectivity) it goes into the mail queue. (sendmail) Sendmail probably works though TransPort, but we don't know if it can be torified for proper stream isolation.
* (From the popcon readme) "''Each popularity-contest host is identified by a random 128bit uuid (MY_HOSTID in /etc/popularity-contest.conf).''" - This would allow to enumerate a quite good guess about the amount number of Whonix users. We are not sure if sourceforge could already have an insight about that (due to Whonix News File downloads, see whonixcheck) or about any other negative implications.
* MY_HOSTID would probably get created at Whonix build time and all Whonix users would have the same MY_HOSTID, which would make it useless. A new MY_HOSTID would have to be created at first boot of Whonix.
* Popcon runs at a random day. Good.
* If the machine is powered on: it runs at 6:47, which is bad, because a local adversary (ISP or hotspot) could guess popcon runs over Tor which would likely be a Whonix user.
* If the machine is powered off at 6:47, it sends the report later, only if anachron is installed. It shouldn't run instantly after powering on, also for fingerprinting reasons. The time would have to be truly randomized.
* <s>The transmission is not encrypted, see [http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=480860 popularity-contest should encrypt contents] and it is not planned to encrypt it. Malicious Tor exit relays could modify the transmission, but this is only a minor issue. Such malicious Tor exit relays could send fake transmissions on their own.</s>
* It is questionable if and if yes, how long Debian will accept popularity contest transmissions from Tor exit relays. There is potential for electoral fraud.

For these reasons it is not a good idea to add popcon to Whonix. If you have suggestions or a different view, please get in contact.
