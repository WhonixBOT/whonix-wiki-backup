== Introduction ==
This chapter applies to the host(s), Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation.

''Whonix Example Implementation'' is currently based on Debian. There were development discussions about switching to [http://qubes-os.org Qubes OS], BSD, Alpine Linux or other secure operating systems.

Whonix can't protect against malicious code inserted into upstream operating system infrastructure. Debian ensures some chain of trust as it requires contributors to sign commits.

== Why don't you use <your favorite most secure operating system> for Whonix? ==
Why do you use Debian, and not...

The operating system must have

* acceptable usability
* must be somewhat popular, because only that leads to sufficient public scrutiny and enough available documentation.
* For redistribution of Whonix, there may also not be any legal/trademark issues such as with Ubuntu. (See "Switch from Ubuntu to Debian" chapter below).
* Must have a secure operating system updater (package manager), i.e. must not fall through the [https://www.updateframework.com/wiki/Docs/Security#AttacksandWeaknesses TUF Threat Model] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6F7Io2ncN w]). Not having a secure updater is [https://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/11/apple-took-3-years-to-fix-finfisher-trojan-hole/ very dangerous] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6FULk4z8t w]).
* Source based distributions take a long time for upgrading and installation of packages, which users complain about. The same or even better security characteristics can be reached with deterministic (reproducible) builds.

Debian is a good compromise of security and usability.

By the way, this chapter won't only include examples which fall through Whonix's threat model.

Why not use a minimal Linux distribution? See [[FAQ#Why_are_the_Whonix_images_so_big.3F|Why are the Whonix images so big?]]

There might be more secure operating systems, such as [http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Hardened_Gentoo Hardenend] [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/hardened/ Gentoo], but in Patrick's opinion mortal users are unlikely to learn how to use them. More paranoids (and others) are welcome to use them for example as host operating system and leave feedback. Patches/ports welcome!

OpenBSD is recommended against, because it completely falls through the Whonix threat model, see FAQ entry: [[FAQ#Why_aren.27t_you_using_OpenBSD.2C_it.27s_the_most_secure_OS_ever.21.21.211.21|Why aren't you using OpenBSD, it's the most secure OS ever!!!1!]]

FreeBSD and OpenWRT have their own FAQ entries you could look into.

* FreeBSD: [[FAQ#Why_don.27t_you_use_FreeBSD.2C_which_is_more_secure.3F.21.3F|Why don't you use FreeBSD, which is more secure?!?]]
* OpenWRT: [[FAQ#Why_don.27t_you_use_OpenWRT.2C_which_is_more_secure.3F.21.3F|Why don't you use OpenWRT, which is more secure?!?]]

Ubuntu isn't used as Whonix-Gateway/Workstation operating system for legal reasons (see below) and was lately negatively perceived due to {{Code2|privacy issues}}<ref>[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/10/privacy-ubuntu-1210-amazon-ads-and-data-leaks Privacy in Ubuntu 12.10: Amazon Ads and Data Leaks]</ref>, so it's recommended against to use it as host operating system as well.

Mac OS X can not be used for legal reasons. Even if that were not a problem, it's still a proprietary, closed source operating system, We don't like their attitude and how they (not) communicate with the security community. Also also see: [https://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/11/apple-took-3-years-to-fix-finfisher-trojan-hole/ Apple Took 3+ Years to Fix FinFisher Trojan Hole].

[http://alpinelinux.org/ Alpine Linux] on first sight appears to have interesting security features. But they [http://bugs.alpinelinux.org/issues/1067 don't package Tor yet]. Other than that, we didn't look thoroughly into it.

Fedora yet did '''not''' fall through Whonix's threat model and could be considered as host and future or alternative Whonix-Gateway/Workstation operating system. Also Qubes OS, an operating system focusing on security by isolation, is based on Fedora. Started considering it, help welcome, see [[Dev/Fedora]].

Qubes OS as host operating system would is most interesting. For implementation, see [[Qubes|Qubes]].

== Switch from Ubuntu to Debian ==
Beginning from 0.4.4, ''Whonix Example Implementation'' is based on Debian. Previously it was based on Ubuntu. From technical view, Ubuntu was a good choice, see [[Ubuntu#About_Ubuntu|About Ubuntu]] if you are interested.

The switch was due to Ubuntu Trademark issues, see [http://www.ubuntu.com/aboutus/trademarkpolicy About Ubuntu Trademark]. The terms are long and complicated. Since Whonix's changes are beyond a ''remix'' (as defined by Ubuntu Licensing), Whonix would either to have to ask for a license, which they reserve to revoke. Such a legally insecure state is not acceptable. Or Whonix would have to rebrand Ubuntu. It would be possible in theory, but in practice it would require a lot work to remove all Ubuntu strings. [https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-users/2012-September/263760.html Even new apt mirrors would be required], which is much beyond the manpower of the Whonix project.

Debian is much more free. According to Debian project leader Stefano Zacchiroli (in private mail), there are no trademark issues as long as the derivative does not claim to be Debian. That is easy to fulfill.

Derivatives of Debian are even encouraged to use Debian infrastructure, see [http://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Guidelines Derivatives/Guidelines]. Debian even supports derivatives. There is a lot documentation, see [http://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives Derivatives] and even a [http://lists.debian.org/debian-derivatives/ debian-derivatives mailing list].

== About Debian ==
=== General ===
Whonix is based on Debian. To be specific, as in Whonix 7, Debian testing is used as codename in ''/etc/apt/sources.list'', not stable.

Although the [http://www.debian.org/security/faq Debian security FAQ] states, that stable gets more attention from the security team, Debian Testing can't be so bad either, since many distributions are based on Debian testing and/or even Debian sid (unstable).

[http://www.trapkit.de/tools/checksec.html checksec.sh] --kernel reports good kernel protection: GCC stack protector support, Enforce read-only kernel data, Restrict /dev/mem and /dev/kmem access are all enabled.

=== Why is Whonix 8 based on Debian Stable, not Debian Testing? ===
* Sometimes severe bugs are introduced in Debian testing, such as the AppArmor [http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=732578 bug], which prevented Tor from starting for everyone until a workaround was applied.
* Sometimes bugs are introduced which break Whonix's build script, such as [http://ml.grml.org/pipermail/grml/2014-January/011546.html this] bug related to mount, which breaks grml-debootstrap and therefore Whonix's build script or [http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=734794 this] kpartx bug.
* Often other disturbing bugs are introduced, such as the grub bug (not able to reproduce and report upstream yet), non-functional VirtualBox Guest Additions or [http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=728399 issues] with shared folders.
* Sometimes packages get entirely removed from Debian testing, such as enigmail wasn't available for a while in Debian testing. This is confusing and constantly creating support requests.
* Too often, too many packages are upgraded (not just security fixes) (costs lots of time to keep up, bandwidth, system load).
* obfs3 (obfsproxy 0.2.3) is [http://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/dists/stable/main/binary-i386/Packages available] again in torproject's repository.

=== Popularity Contest ===
The Debian ''popularity-contest'' (popcon) package does not get installed on Whonix. Installing it gets prevented by the [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-meta-packages/blob/master/debian/control#L324 anon-banned-packages] package.

[http://popcon.debian.org/README popcon readme] | [http://popcon.debian.org/FAQ popcon faq] | [http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=popularity-contest popcon bugs] | [http://lists.alioth.debian.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/popcon-developers popularity contest mailing list] | [http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/popcon-developers/2012-October/002172.html popularity contest mailing list: Drop atime and ctime for privacy reasons possible?]

Some privacy considerations and reasons why it's not installed:

* The connection would obviously need to go over its own Tor circuit (stream isolation). At the moment popcon tries to go through http and if it fails (no internet connectivity) it goes into the mail queue. (sendmail) Sendmail probably works though TransPort, but we don't know if it can be torified for proper stream isolation.
* (From the popcon readme) "''Each popularity-contest host is identified by a random 128bit uuid (MY_HOSTID in /etc/popularity-contest.conf).''" - This would allow to enumerate a quite good guess about the amount number of Whonix users. We are not sure if sourceforge could already have an insight about that (due to Whonix News File downloads, see whonixcheck) or about any other negative implications.
* MY_HOSTID would probably get created at Whonix build time and all Whonix users would have the same MY_HOSTID, which would make it useless. A new MY_HOSTID would have to be created at first boot of Whonix.
* Popcon runs at a random day. Good.
* If the machine is powered on: it runs at 6:47, which is bad, because a local adversary (ISP or hotspot) could guess popcon runs over Tor which would likely be a Whonix user.
* If the machine is powered off at 6:47, it sends the report later, only if anachron is installed. It shouldn't run instantly after powering on, also for fingerprinting reasons. The time would have to be truly randomized.
* <s>The transmission is not encrypted, see [http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=480860 popularity-contest should encrypt contents] and it's not planned to encrypt it. Malicious Tor exit relays could modify the transmission, but this is only a minor issue. Such malicious Tor exit relays could send fake transmissions on their own.</s>
* It's questionable if and if yes, how long Debian will accept popularity contest transmissions from Tor exit relays. There is potential for electoral fraud.

For these reasons it's not a good idea to add popcon to Whonix. If you have suggestions or a different view, please get in contact.
