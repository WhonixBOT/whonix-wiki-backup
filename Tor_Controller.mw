= Tor Controller =

Two options. '''Arm''' or Vidalia. '''Arm''' is already '''pre-installed''' on Whonix and '''recommended'''.

= Vidalia =

'''Not recommended.'''<ref>
* Because not tested since version 0.1.3. There will be probably no anonymity issues, but the instructions may not work out of the box.
* Vidalia is unmaintained (no one is working on it anymore). Vidalia has been removed Tor Browser Bundle 3.x by The Tor Project. So this project is pretty much dead anyway.
* Vidalia has issues with control a system Tor, i.e. Vialia can't stop the Tor which comes from the Debian package, which is started as user "debian-tor". It also can not edit /etc/tor/torrc. Not sure if control commands such as New Idenity are correctly processed (easy to find out).
* Vidalia does not understand obfuscated bridges.
* Which overall makes a pretty bad and confusing user experience. Therefore recommended against.
* However, if it's Vialia's nice network map you're after, you may be able to get it working.
</ref> Better use Arm. See below.

= Arm =

Since Whonix does not include Vidalia, Arm is '''recommended'''. It's already pre-installed on Whonix-Gateway.

[[Image:screenshot_arm_page1_cropped.png|arm, Tor Controller|thumb]]

To start it, simply type on Whonix-Gateway:

<pre>sudo arm</pre>

To get a new circuit, press.

<pre>n</pre>
