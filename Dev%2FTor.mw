= Tor Version =

According to the [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/teams/NetworkTeam/CoreTorReleases#Listofreleases Tor release note], there are usually several different major versions of Tor supported by the Tor project. However, due to the the limited time the Tor packager has, only a few major versions are packaged and ready to be used.

For example, at the time of writing (December, 2017), five major versions of Tor are supported. Specifically:

# Debian stretch repository only contains another LTS which is version 0.2.9.<br />
# {{code|deb.torproject.org}}, also known as TPO repository, contains only the latest stable Tor which is version 0.3.1.9.

A major consideration in choosing the most suitable Tor version for {{project name}} is that the latest stable found in the TPO repository may lead to network breakage. <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-gateway-tor-0-2-9-9-unrecommended-no-update-unsafe/4240/8</ref> The reason is the "stable" tag indicates it is stable version of Tor, which does not necessarily match the "stable" Debian version that {{project name}} is actually using. <ref>The Debian target is usually the stable package, which is currently: {{Stable_project_version_based_on_Debian_codename}}) or {{project_name}}.</ref>

There are three primary Tor options for {{project name}} developers and each of them has pros and cons:

'''1. Use the Tor LTS version from the official Debian package repository: {{code|packages.debian.org}}'''

* Advantages: Minimal effort is required in {{project_name}}.
* Disadvantages: Misses the advantages of later versions (see below).

'''2. Use latest stable in TPO repository and allow testers to use the Tor nightly build in {{project_name}}, with bug reporting bug to TPO'''

* Advantages: Latest features, better security, improved Tor Browser compatibility (using SocksPort with flags and even better connectivity performance). <ref>Patrick: "Historically when there was a botnet starting to use Tor, the LTS version barely connected while the latest stable had the ntor handshake which worked." See [https://blog.torproject.org/tor-weekly-news-september-4th-2013].</ref>
* Disadvantages: From the {{project name}} perspective, these packages are uploaded to {{code|deb.torproject.org}} at random times. These packages are not guaranteed to be compatible with {{project_name}}. While there are no security concerns, these packages could break a system's apt-get package management (due to incompatible dependencies) or connectivity, in case Tor refuses to start. This can arise due to a configuration incompatibility in a newer version of Tor, or for other reasons such as systemd or apparmor related changes.

'''3. Versions are downloaded from {{code|deb.torproject.org}}, verified to work, and then migrated to {{code|deb.whonix.org}}'''

* Advantages: Flexibility in version selection, a guaranteed way to confirm that only stable Tor versions which are functional in {{project name}} will be uploaded.
* Disadvantages: A few testers are needed, manual uploads are required, and {{project name}} touches Tor.

{{project_name}} developers have chosen the third method for now. <ref>Relative {{project name}} Forum discussion: https://forums.whonix.org/t/tor-releases-discussion/4578</ref> However, the comparison above suggests better security and compatibility is afforded by the second option. This approach requires a lot of active testers who can use the Tor nightly build and report bugs to the Tor project or {{project_name}}. <ref>Please contact us if you would like to be a Tor nightly build tester for {{project_name}}.</ref>

= Tor Config Files =
== Rationale for Tor Drop-In Configuration Folder ==
Having a Tor [[Configuration_Files#Configuration_Drop-In_Folders|Configuration Drop-In Folder]] makes implementation of additional features that require additional Tor settings much easier. For example it could improve usability to provide a <code>whonix-gw-hidden-webserver</code> package, that automates the {{gateway_product_name}} specific instructions for [[Onion Services]]. Such a package could just drop the configuration snippet there, and if the feature gets disabled or the package installed, that configuration snippet gets purged. Adding additions to <code>/etc/tor/torrc</code> with a script is problematic, because those additions cannot be removed by a script if the user slightly modified those lines and because these can cause a [[Configuration_Files#dpkg_interactive_conflict_resolution_dialog|<code>dpkg interactive conflict resolution dialog</code>]].

== Current Implementation ==
The implementation is as it follows.

* <code>/etc/tor/torrc</code> holds minimal content, so ideally it will need as few updates as possible or never again in the future. The only effective command is <code>%include /etc/torrc.d/</code> which results in parsing folder [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-gw-anonymizer-config/tree/master/etc/torrc.d <code>/etc/torrc.d</code>].
* The lexical high file [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-gw-anonymizer-config/blob/master/etc/torrc.d/95_whonix.conf <code>/etc/torrc.d/95_whonix.conf</code>] instructions to <code>%include /usr/local/etc/torrc.d/</code>.
* Instructions in <code>/etc/tor/torrc</code> and [[Tor|documentation]] instructs users to not edit that file and use use <code>/usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf</code> instead.
* <code>/etc/tor/torrc.examples</code> contains configuration examples.
* Some {{project name}} Tor settings unfortunately still go into [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-gw-anonymizer-config/blob/master/usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc.anondist <code>/usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc</code>] due to [https://phabricator.whonix.org/T947 Qubes-Whonix eth1 static networking] feature not being implemented yet.
* Most users probably ignore <code>/usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc</code>, because this file is barely advertised and barely popular.
* <code>/usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc</code> can be modified by Qubes-Whonix [https://github.com/Whonix/qubes-whonix/blob/master/usr/lib/qubes-whonix/replace-ips <code>replace-ips</code>] without any conflicts with user modifications or [[Configuration_Files#dpkg_interactive_conflict_resolution_dialog|<code>dpkg interactive conflict resolution dialog</code>]].
* [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-gw-anonymizer-config/blob/master/usr/lib/anon-gw-anonymizer-config/torrc-d-cleaner <code>torrc.d</code> cleaner] by {{project name}} developers moves files in folder <code>/usr/local/etc/torrc.d/</code> and <code>/etc/torrc.d/</code> that do not have the <code>.conf</code> file extension out of the way. This is to workaround a [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/25140 Tor upstream issue], namely only supporting parsing all files in a folder which can include which end have a <code>~</code> file extension (backup files created by file editors) or start with a dot ("<code>.</code>") ("hidden files") which can then result in effective configurations other than what the user expects. These superfluous files users are unaware off often contain settings the user already changed in the real (non-backup) file.

== Rejected Alternatives ==
=== Only Two Config Files ===
* Using only {{Code2|/usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc}} and {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}, not using {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc.examples}}.
* And having configuration examples (instructions) in {{Code2|/usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc}}. Using a minimal {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}} to tell them to look into {{Code2|/usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc}} for configuration examples.
* This is a bad idea, because users get tempted comment in things in {{Code2|/usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc}}.
* When they do this, they settings would get lost and overwritten without asking next time they update [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/anon-gw-anonymizer-config anon-gw-anonymizer-config], because {{Code2|/usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc}} is not a configuration file (since in {{Code2|/usr}}, not {{Code2|/etc}} folder).

=== Only One Config File ===
* Using only {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}, leaving {{Code2|/usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc}} with defaults (from Debian), not using {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc.examples}}.
* Using {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}} for user examples, user's own modifications and {{project name}} Tor settings.
* This is bad, because when users have edited {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}} and anon-gw-anonymizer-config gets updated, it will throw an [[Configuration_Files#dpkg_interactive_conflict_resolution_dialog|<code>dpkg interactive conflict resolution dialog</code>]]. Users might decide to keep their old config file and will miss (security) improvements.

= Why Waste Network Bandwidth by Downloading Operating System Updates over Tor? =

The short answer is this option was discussed with The Tor Project and {{project name}} was granted permission to do so.

Interested readers who want to learn more should review the following:

* Tor Project thread about this issue; see [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorBOX/Dev/ArchivedDiscussion/DOCUMENTATION#updatesoverTorshouldnotwasteTorbandwidthDOCUMENTATIONSOLVED updates over Tor, should not waste Tor bandwidth]. 
* The Tor Project was asked directly, after this issue and possible solutions were discussed thoroughly by the {{project name}} team; see [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-March/023486.html tor-talk Operating system updates / software installation behind Tor Transparent Proxy]. <ref>Click [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-March/subject.html#23507 here] for an overview of all answers.</ref>
* Andrew Lewman, a former Executive Director, Director and press contact for Tor downloads a lot of updates over the network and [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-March/023493.html did not complain].
