== Introduction ==

The success of the Whonix platform is the sum total of several factors:

* The solid foundation at its heart - the Debian GNU/Linux distribution.
* The software provided by several other projects (like Tor) and the tireless efforts of their many developers and maintainers. <ref>Which form part of the core anonymity and security features in Whonix.</ref>
* Lessons learned from:
** Expert advice provided in various Internet forums and attendance at software development events.
** Previous failures and successes in the Whonix development cycle.
** The failures and successes of similar anonymity projects (like Tails).
* Inspiration drawn from other projects, leading to the implementation of new or improved anonymity / security features.
* Direct contributions by the Whonix community.

== Sources ==

Over the lifetime of the Whonix project, development has been informed by thousands of external resources. For the reader's interest, a very small sample of older sources is listed [[Old_Sources|here]]. Numerous updated sources can be found in [[Dev|developer documentation]] footnotes.

== Similar Projects ==

Here is a list of projects with similar goals to Whonix. The list is here for reference. Those projects may have interesting thoughts, mistakes, security enhancements, features and so on. The useful stuff can be potentially ported to Whonix. Some projects inspired the development of Whonix (missing features, implementation reference etc.).

* [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/JanusVM A few reasons listed in this link not to use some of those projects applies here as well.]
* [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/Torouter Torouter]; alpha
* [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorDreamPlug Tor and the DreamPlug]; similar networking/firewall
* [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/OpenWRT Tor and OpenWRT]; similar networking/firewall
* [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransparentProxy Transparent Proxy]; it offers: 1. Transparently anonymizing traffic for a specific user; 2. Local Redirection Through Tor; 3. Anonymizing Middlebox; 4. Local Redirection and Anonymizing Middlebox; closest one to Whonix is Anonymizing Middlebox; Whonix is an Isolating Proxy
* [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransocksifyingTor Transocksifying Tor]; now outdated; back when Tor didn't natively support TransPort; uses a different firewall with DNAT
* [https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/ PELD]; specification and implementation (in the form of Tails

* [http://tor.hermetix.org/torvm/index.html.en another TorVM]; from unknown authors; site wants to look similar to official Tor site; fishy

* [http://tails.boum.org Tails]; Live CD/USB distribution preconfigured to use Tor safely.; listed on https://www.torproject.org; with [http://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/Tor_enforcement/ Tor enforcement]
* old instructions from [http://board.gulli.com/thread/993224-tutorial-alle-tcp-ip-verbindung-eines-vmware-guests-automatisch-ueber-tor-leiten board.gulli.com]; in German language; more complicated; back when Tor didn't natively support TransPort
* Running a TOR Relay on OpenBSD [https://raindog308.com/openbsd_tor_part_1 part 1] [https://raindog308.com/openbsd_tor_part_2 part 2]; no review yet

* [http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2011/09/playing-with-qubes-networking-for-fun.html Qubes]; focuses on security through isolation based on virtualization. This blog post provides some hints how to integrate Tor but the actual implementation is left to the user.
* [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2009-September/019541.html Onion Service Setup Guide for Newbies (Version .2)]; howto; you don't have to download the pdf, you find the guide on google and in google cache (google the pdf link)
