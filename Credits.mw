== Introduction ==

The success of the {{project name}} platform is the sum total of several factors:

* The solid foundation at its heart - the Debian GNU/Linux distribution.
* The software provided by several other projects (like Tor and Qubes) and the tireless efforts of their many developers and contributors. <ref>Which form part of the core anonymity and security features in {{project_name}}.</ref>
* Lessons learned from:
** Expert advice provided in various Internet forums and attendance at software development events.
** Previous failures and successes in the {{project name}} development cycle.
** The failures and successes of similar anonymity projects (like Tails).
* Inspiration drawn from other projects, leading to the implementation of new or improved anonymity / security features.
* Direct contributions by the {{project name}} community.

== Sources ==

Over the lifetime of the {{project name}} project, development has been informed by thousands of external resources. For the reader's interest, a very small sample of older sources is listed [[Old_Sources|here]]. Numerous updated sources can be found in [[Dev|developer documentation]] footnotes.

== Similar Projects ==

There are a number of projects that share security and anonymity goals with {{project_name}}. The reference list below captures a number of influential projects that have interesting proposals, security enhancements, desirable features and so on. <ref>This list includes projects that have directly affected prior {{project name}} development or those who made mistakes in either their design or implementation, which {{project name}} developers learnt from.</ref> The intent is for any useful developments to be (potentially) ported to {{project_name}}, as has occurred in the past.

=== Design Specifications ===

* '''[http://tails.boum.org Tails]:''' A live CD / USB distribution which is preconfigured to use Tor safely. <ref>Tails is listed on https://www.torproject.org. The design documents describe the [http://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/Tor_enforcement/ Tor enforcement] mechanisms.</ref>

* '''[http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2011/09/playing-with-qubes-networking-for-fun.html {{q_project_name}}]:''' This blog post provided the first hints on integrating {{project name}} into Qubes. <ref>Qubes focuses on security through isolation based on virtualization. The actual implementation was left to the user at that time.</ref>
* '''[https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/torvm/ TorVM] for Qubes:''' ([https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-app-linux-tor qubes-tor]).

=== Transparent Proxies ===

* '''[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/JanusVM JanusVM].''' <ref>This was deprecated long ago. A few of those reasons listed in the link (not to use some other projects) are equally applicable here.</ref>
* '''[http://www.janusvm.com/tor_vm/ TorVM]:''' From the same authors as JanusVM, this project is also [https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torvm/ deprecated].
* '''[http://tor.hermetix.org/torvm/index.html.en Another TorVM]:''' A contribution by unknown authors, with a site that imitates the official Tor one. <ref>This behavior raises questions about the possible motives of the developers.</ref>
* '''[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransparentProxy Tor Project Transparent Proxy]:''' Now outdated, but it offers: transparent anonymizing traffic for a specific user; local redirection through Tor; an anonymizing middlebox; and local redirection and an anonymizing middlebox. <ref>The configuration closest to {{project name}} is the anonymizing middlebox ({{project_name}} is an isolating proxy).</ref> <ref>The guide also notes: ''"See ​{{project_name}} for a complete, ready-made VM based solution (alternatively using multiple physical computers) built around the Isolating Proxy and Transparent Proxy Anonymizing Middlebox design."''</ref>
* '''[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransocksifyingTor Transocksifying Tor]:''' This method to use a different firewall with DNT is now outdated, since it was only needed when Tor did not natively support TransPort.
* '''[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorVPN TorVPN]:''' The abandoned and unfinished predecessor to TorBOX. <ref>TorBOX was later renamed to {{project_name}}.</ref>
