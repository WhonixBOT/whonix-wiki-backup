== New Qubes TemplateBasedVMs: Latest Tor Browser Version ==

Optional. It is possible to have a copy of the latest Tor Browser version made available to all freshly created AppVMs and DispVMs based upon the TemplateVM. Run the following command in the TemplateVM. <ref>https://github.com/Whonix/tb-updater/blob/master/debian/tb-updater.postinst</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo touch /etc/secbrowser-qubes
}}

This setting utilizes the same mechanism used by Whonix to download Tor Browser in the Whonix-Workstation TemplateVM. See also: [[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#tb-updater_in_Qubes_TemplateVM|tb-updater in Qubes TemplateVM]]. When using this setting, when the tb-updater package is updated, <code>download-secbrowser</code> runs automatically.

== Package Installation ==
The first step to install <code>tb-updater</code> is to add the Whonix repository. <ref>
However, as outlined in this [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/4291 Qubes issue], downloading GPG keys with APT will fail in TemplateVMs. To work around this issue the signing key can be downloaded in an AppVM and copied over to the Debian TemplateVM in a text file.
</ref>

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Download the Whonix signing key.

In an AppVM or DispVM, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
curl --tlsv1.2 --proto =https --max-time 180 --output ~/patrick.asc https://www.whonix.org/patrick.asc
}}

'''2.''' Copy the <code>patrick.asc</code> text file to the Debian TemplateVM.

{{CodeSelect|code=
qvm-copy patrick.asc
}}

'''3.''' Change directory into the Qubes incoming files folder.

<code>name-of-appvm</code> needs to be replaced with the name of the AppVM where this file originated from.

In the TemplateVM.

{{CodeSelect|code=
cd ~/QubesIncoming/name-of-appvm
}}

'''4.''' Display the key's fingerprint.

In the TemplateVM.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --keyid-format long --import --import-options show-only --with-fingerprint patrick.asc
}}

'''5.''' Compare the fingerprint displayed in the terminal to the one listed [[Whonix Signing Key|here]].

'''6.''' In the Debian TemplateVM, import the Whonix signing key.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-key --keyring /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/whonix.gpg add patrick.asc
}}

'''7.''' In the Debian TemplateVM, add the Whonix APT repository to Debian APT sources.

{{CodeSelect|code=
echo "deb https://deb.whonix.org {{Stable project version based on Debian codename}} main contrib non-free" {{!}} sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/whonix.list
}}
}}

In the Debian TemplateVM, update the packages lists.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}

Install.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends secbrowser
}}

== Download SecBrowser ™ ==
=== Manually In TemplateVM ===
If tb-updater has not been updated yet, Qubes users can run the following command in Qubes TemplateVM.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo download-secbrowser
}}

You will be presented with <code>QUESTION: Download now?</code> followed by choice of 3 options. 
Example: <code>n/9.0.2/9.5a3</code> (Version is at the time of writing this documentation.) The default is <code>n</code> which stands for "no" if you just press the <code>Enter</code> key. Otherwise type in the full version number to indicate your choice of either the stable release (i.e. <code>9.0.2</code>) or the alpha release (<code>9.5a3</code>).

When the download completes & is verified successfully, you will be prompted whether to <code>Install now?</code>. Type in <code>y</code> to proceed.

Power off the TemplateVM after installation so these changes can propagate to newly started TemplateBasedVMs.

=== In AppVM ===
SecBrowser ™ can be installed simply by running <code>download-secbrowser</code> in the Debian TemplateVM.

In the Debian TemplateVM, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
download-secbrowser
}}

=== Tor Browser Internal Updater ===
It is still possible to use the Tor Browser Internal Updater in TemplateBasedVMs.

== Start SecBrowser ™ ==
SecBrowser ™ can be started from Qubes start menu.

Alternatively, run this command in a AppVM or DispVM terminal.

{{CodeSelect|code=
secbrowser
}}

Alternatively, run this command in a <code>dom0</code> terminal.

{{CodeSelect|code=
qvm-run <appvm_name> secbrowser
}}

= SecBrowser Settings and Configuration =

== TemplateVM vs AppVM ==  

If users edit the TemplateVM to modify SecBrowser ™ behavior, all AppVMs created thereafter will inherit those changes. However, AppVMs created prior to the aforementioned edits will not benefit from any changes to the SecBrowser ™ configuration file in the TemplateVM.

While SecBrowser ™ has numerous security enhancements they can come at a cost of decreased usability. Since it is also highly configurable, security settings and behavior can be customized according to personal requirements.

<u>Note:</u> The following configuration steps are run the Debian AppVM.
