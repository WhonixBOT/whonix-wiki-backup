UniStation - A Tor TransparentProxy with only One Machine
}}

{{Testers-only}}

= Introduction =

[[Main_Page|{{project_name}}]] needs at least two systems. One running Tor, {{Gateway product name}}. The other running clients that are routed through Tor, {{Workstation product name}}. This ensures the highest possible security and isolation. We can implement this using different strategies: Two VMs (Gateway VM and Workstation VM) or bare metal.

A different approach is to run Tor and applications all on the same machine. This can be either a VM or bare metal host.

This site will guide you through all required steps to set up a UniStation. A machine which routes all traffic through the Tor anonymity network. This is an implementation of a [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransparentProxy Tor TransparentProxy].

Advantages:

* Only one machine required.
* Lower system requirements.

Disadvantages:

* More difficult to install.
* User might have to set the [[#interface|network interface setting]].
* If using VMs: Guest VM can see MAC address of host?
* Less secure than {{Project name}} with {{Gateway product name}} and {{Workstation product name}}.
* This is not as well polished, developed and thought through as {{Project name}} yet.
* Enhancements that come with {{Workstation product name}} such as:
** [[Tor Browser]]
** [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-apps-config anon-apps-config]
** [[whonixcheck]]
** [[Whonix Live]]
** [[kloak]]
** [[Linux_Kernel_Runtime_Guard_LKRG|LKRG]]
** [https://github.com/Whonix/tirdad tirdad]
** [[AppArmor]]
** [[Anon Connection Wizard]]
** [[sdwdate-gui]]
** [https://github.com/Whonix/open-link-confirmation open-link-confirmation]
** [[Bridges]] usability, [[Documentation]]
** and maybe [https://github.com/Whonix others]
* have not been considered yet.
* This will potentially not be maintained as well as {{Project name}}.

= Installation =
== Packages ==
Install gnupg. <ref>
Required for Debian netinst "minimal" (no default system tools).
</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt install gnupg
}}

apt-get-noninteractive to avoid asking this question.
<pre>
Setting up anon-base-files (3:4.6-1) ...

Configuration file '/etc/machine-id'
 ==> File on system created by you or by a script.
 ==> File also in package provided by package maintainer.
   What would you like to do about it ?  Your options are:
    Y or I  : install the package maintainer's version
    N or O  : keep your currently-installed version
      D     : show the differences between the versions
      Z     : start a shell to examine the situation
 The default action is to keep your current version.
*** machine-id (Y/I/N/O/D/Z) [default=N] ? i

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get-noninteractive install --no-install-recommends kicksecure-cli whonix-firewall uwt anon-gw-dns-conf ipv4-forward-disable ipv6-disable
}}

== Firewall Settings ==
Find out your network interface name. You can learn about what interfaces you have by running.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo ifconfig
}}

Edit <code>/etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_user.conf</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudoedit /etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_user.conf
}}

Paste.

{{anchor|interface}}
You might have to change <code>#EXT_IF="eth0"</code> by removing the hash <code>#</code> in front of it and by setting it to the name of your network interface such as <code>wlan0</code>. I.e. the full line might look like this: <code>EXT_IF="wlan0"</code> Include it with the to be pasted text below. <ref>
VirtualBox: <code>EXT_IF="enp0s3"</code>
</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
## 0: disabled
## 1: enabled

## External interface
## defaults to:
#EXT_IF="eth0"

WORKSTATION_TRANSPARENT_TCP=0
WORKSTATION_TRANSPARENT_UDP=0
WORKSTATION_TRANSPARENT_DNS=0
WORKSTATION_ALLOW_SOCKSIFIED=0
CONTROL_PORT_FILTER_PROXY_ENABLE=0

GATEWAY_TRANSPARENT_TCP=1
GATEWAY_TRANSPARENT_UDP=0
GATEWAY_TRANSPARENT_DNS=1
GATEWAY_ALLOW_INCOMING_ICMP=0
}}

If you want port 22 to open for incoming SSH, also paste:

{{CodeSelect|code=
GATEWAY_ALLOW_INCOMING_SSH=1
}}

Save.

== Qubes ==

Qubes only. Does not hurt otherwise.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl mask qubes-iptables
}}

Qubes Debian based VMs would require further <code>/etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_user.conf</code> modifications. See footnote. <ref>
This was required in Qubes to make Whonix-Gateways Own Traffic Transparent Proxy work. In that case, append to <code>/etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_user.conf</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
NON_TOR_GATEWAY="\
            127.0.0.0-127.0.0.24 \
            10.137.0.0-10.138.255.255 \
         "
}}

== torsocks ==
torsocks config not required. uwt sets that up for us.

* https://github.com/Whonix/uwt
* https://github.com/Whonix/uwt/blob/master/etc/tor/torsocks.conf.anondist

== Tor Configuration ==
Open Tor configuration file <code>/etc/tor/torrc</code> with root rights.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudoedit /etc/tor/torrc
}}

Paste. <ref>
<code>DisableNetwork 0</code> is required to make sdwdate work because the connectivity check locks at it.
</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
TransPort 127.0.0.1:9041
DnsPort 127.0.0.1:5400
DisableNetwork 0
}}

Save.

Restart Tor.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl restart tor
}}

== APT ==
Check if there is something you need in <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code>.

Move original <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> out of the way because <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list</code> by {{Kicksecure}} replaces it.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo mv /etc/apt/sources.list ~/
}}

== Reboot ==
Reboot required.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo reboot
}}

= Usage =
== check sdwdate ==
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl status sdwdate --no-pager
}}

== Updates ==
Update as per usual. See also [[Operating System Software and Updates]].

Thanks to [https://github.com/Whonix/uwt uwt] it is [[Stream Isolation|stream isolated]] (using Tor <code>SocksPort</code>). No need to use <code>torsocks</code>. <code>uwt</code> uses <code>torsocks</code> which is configued to use <code>IsolatePID 1</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt update
}}

== Transparent DNS Functional ==
{{CodeSelect|code=
nslookup torproject.org
}}

= Troubleshooting =
Depending on network configuration perhaps <code>/etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_user.conf</code> need to be appended.
