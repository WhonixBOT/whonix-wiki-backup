{{Anchor|I wonder what my site looks like when I'm anonymous}}
== Visit your Own Website when Anonymous ==
<translate>

"I wonder what my site looks like when I'm anonymous?" <ref>https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2012-April/003472.html</ref>

<!--T:4-->
It is best to avoid visiting personal websites where either real names or pseudonyms are attached, particularly if they have ever been tied to a non-Tor connection / IP address. Very few people are likely to visit your personal website over Tor, meaning the user may be the only unique Tor client to do so. 

This behavior leads to weak anonymity because once the website is visited the Tor circuit is "dirty". If the site is not popular and does not receive much traffic, the Tor exit relay can be fairly certain that the visiting individual is the user. After that point, it can be reasonably assumed that further connections originating from that Tor exit relay also come from the user's machine.

{{Anchor|Login into your real life Facebook account and think you are anonymous}}

== Login to Social Networks Accounts and Think you are Anonymous == <!--T:6-->

<!--T:7-->
Don't login into personal Facebook or other social network accounts over Tor. Even if a pseudonym is used instead of a real name, the account likely has linked friends who know the account's true owner. As a result, the social network can reasonably guess who the user really is.

<!--T:8-->
No anonymity solution is perfect. Online anonymity software may reliably hide IP addresses and locational data, but Facebook and similar corporations do not need this information. Social networks already know: who the user is, associated friends, the content of "private" messages sent and so on. This data is at least stored on social network servers, and no kind of software can delete it. Only social networking platforms and hacking groups could remove it. <ref>The former is unlikely to ever delete data, since profiling is the primary method of monetizing users with "free" accounts. Profiling is used for targeted advertising and to generate large user databases that can be on-sold for profit to third-parties.</ref>

<!--T:9-->
Users who log into personal Facebook and other accounts only get location privacy, but not anonymity.

<!--T:10-->
This is not well understood by some social network users: <ref>[https://blog.torproject.org/blog/toggle-or-not-toggle-end-torbutton <i>To Toggle, or not to Toggle: The End of Torbutton</i>]</ref>

{{Anchor|Never login into accounts you ever used without Tor}}

== Never Login to Accounts Used without Tor == <!--T:12-->
Always assume that each time a website is visited, logging by the destination server will include: <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_log</ref>

* Client IP address / location.
* Request date and time.
* Specific webpages requested.
* HTTP code.
* Number of bytes served to the user.
* The user's browser agent.
* The referring website (referrer).


<!--T:13-->
Also assume that the Internet Service Provider (ISP) will at a minimum log total online time and the client IP address / location. The ISP may also log the IP address / location of visited destinations, how much traffic (data) was generated, and what was sent and retrieved. Unless Internet traffic is encrypted, the ISP will be able to see exactly what activities were performed, and the information sent or received. 

The following tables provide a simplified overview of how those logs may appear to administrators.

It is clear that uniform logging by websites and ISPs enables the user's activities and interests to be easily determined.

<!--T:21-->
An account is compromised and tied to the user if even a single login originates from a non-Tor connection / IP address. Singular mistakes are often fatal and have lead to the downfall of many "anonymous" users.

{{Anchor|Don't login into your bank account, paypal, ebay or other important personal accounts unless}}

== Do not Login to Banking or Online Payment Accounts Unless == <!--T:22-->

<!--T:23-->
Logging into banking, PayPal, eBay or other important financial accounts registered in the user's name is not recommended. Where money is involved, use of Tor risks the account being suspended due to "suspicious activity" by the fraud prevention system. The reason is hackers sometimes use Tor for committing fraud.

<!--T:24-->
Using Tor with online banking and payment accounts is not anonymous for reasons already outlined. It is pseudonymous and only offers location privacy and a circumvention method in the event access to the site is blocked by the ISP. The difference between anonymity and pseudonymity is covered in a later chapter (see further below).

<!--T:25-->
If a user is blocked, in many cases the service's support division can be contacted in order to have the account unblocked. Some services will even allow the fraud protection policy to be relaxed for the user's account.

<!--T:26-->
Whonix developer Patrick Schleizer is not opposed to using Tor for circumvention and/or location privacy. However, the user should appreciate that banking or other online payment accounts risk getting (temporarily) suspended. Other outcomes are also possible (service bans, account deletion and so on) as mentioned in warnings on this page and throughout the Whonix documentation. Users who are aware of the risks and who feel comfortable using Tor in their personal circumstances are of course free to ignore this advice.

{{Anchor|Don't alternate Tor with open WiFi}}

== Do not Alternate Tor with Open Wi-Fi == <!--T:27-->

<!--T:28-->
Some users mistakenly think open Wi-Fi is a faster, safe "Tor alternative" since the IP address / location cannot be tied to their real name.

<!--T:29-->
For reasons explained below, it is better to use open Wi-Fi <u>and</u> Tor, but ''not'' open Wi-Fi <u>or</u> Tor.

<!--T:30-->
The approximate location of any IP address can be estimated to the city, region or even street level. Even if a user is  away from their home address, open Wi-Fi still gives away the city or approximate location since most people do not switch continents.

<!--T:31-->
The person running the open Wi-Fi router and their policies are also unknown variables. They could be keeping logs of the user's MAC address and linking it with the activity being sent in the clear through them.

<!--T:32-->
While logging does not necessary break user anonymity, it does reduce the circle of suspects from the entire global population, a continent, or the country, down to a specific region. This effect strongly degrades anonymity. Users should always keep as much information as possible to themselves.

{{Anchor|Prevent Tor over Tor scenarios}}

== Prevent Tor over Tor Scenarios == <!--T:33-->

<!--T:34-->
'''Whonix specific.'''

<!--T:35-->
When using a transparent proxy (Whonix includes one), it is possible to start a Tor session from the client as well as from the transparent proxy, creating a "Tor over Tor" scenario.

<!--T:36-->
This happens when installing Tor inside Whonix-Workstation or when using Tor Browser without configuring it to use a SocksPort instead of the TransPort. (Covered in the [[Tor Browser]] article.)

<!--T:37-->
Doing so produces undefined and potentially unsafe behavior. In theory, however, you can get six hops instead of three, but it is not guaranteed that you'll get three different hops - you could end up with the same hops, maybe in reverse or mixed order. It is not clear if this is safe. It has never been discussed.

<!--T:38-->
You can choose an entry/exit point <ref>https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#ChooseEntryExit</ref>, but you get the best security that Tor can provide when you leave the route selection to Tor; overriding the entry / exit relays can mess up your anonymity in ways we don't understand. Therefore Tor over Tor usage is highly discouraged.

{{Anchor|Don't send sensitive data without end-to-end encryption}}
== Do not Send Sensitive Data without End-to-end Encryption == <!--T:40-->

<!--T:41-->
As already explained on the [[Warning]] page, Tor exit relays can eavesdrop on communications and other Man-in-the-middle attacks can happen. The only way to get sensitive data from the sender to the recipient while withholding it from third parties, is using end-to-end encryption.

{{Anchor|Don't disclose identifying data about yourself}}
== Do not Disclose Identifying Data Online == <!--T:42-->

<!--T:43-->
De-anonymization is not only possible with connections/IP addresses but by social threats too. Some recommendations to avoid anonymization collected by Anonymous:

<!--T:44-->
* Do not include personal information in your nickname
* Do not discuss personal information, where you are from... discussions about something inane like the weather can give an accurate idea where you are located, over time.
* Do not mention your gender, tattoos, piercings or physical capacities.
* Do not mention your profession, hobbies or involvement in activist groups.
* Do not use special characters on keyboard, which are existent only in your language.
* Do not post information to the regular internet while you are anonymous. Do not use Twitter and Facebook. This is easy to correlate.
* Do not post links to Facebook images. The image name contains a personal ID.
* Do not connect to same destination at the same time. Try to alternate.
* IRC, other chats, forum, mailing list, etc. are public, keep that in mind.
* Do not discuss anything about yourself whatsoever even when securely and anonymously connecting to a group of strangers. You don't know who is on the other end or if they have been forced to work against you. It takes one informant to destroy a group.
* Heroes only exist in comic books keep that in mind! There are only young heroes and dead heroes.

<!--T:45-->
If it is a must to disclose identifying data about yourself, treat it as "sensitive data" in the point above.

{{Anchor|Do use bridges if you think Tor usage is dangerous/suspicious in your country}}

== Do Use Bridges if Tor is Deemed Dangerous or Suspicious in your Location == <!--T:47-->

<!--T:48-->
Quoted from the [[Bridges]] page: "''Bridges are important tools that work in many cases but they are '''not an absolute protection''' against the technical progress that an adversary could do to identify Tor users.''"

{{Anchor|Do not Maintain Long-term Identities}}
== Do not Maintain Long-term Identities ==
The longer you use the same pseudonym, the higher the probability that you make mistakes that reveal your identity - which then allows an adversary to go back and link all your activities. As a precaution regularly create new identities and stop using old ones.

{{Anchor|Don't use different online identities at the same time}}
== Do not Use Different Online Identities at the Same Time == <!--T:49-->

<!--T:50-->
They easily correlate. [[Warning#Whonix_doesn.27t_magically_separate_your_different_contextual_identities | Whonix doesn't magically separate your different contextual identities]].

<!--T:51-->
Also read the points below.

{{Anchor|Don't log into Twitter, Facebook, Google, etc. longer than necessary}}
== Do not Login to Twitter, Facebook, Google etc. Longer than Necessary == <!--T:52-->

<!--T:53-->
Restrict the time your are logged in accounts for Twitter, Facebook, Google and any other account based services (web forum etc.) to the time you are using them. After you are done with reading, posting and so on, log out. At least log out, shut down Tor Browser, change your Tor circuit using a [[Tor Controller]], wait a few seconds until the circuit changed, restart Tor Browser. For better security follow the [[Security_Guide#Recommendation_to_use_multiple_VM_Snapshots |  Recommendation to use multiple VM Snapshots]] and/or to [[Multiple Whonix-Workstations |  use multiple Whonix-Workstations]].

<!--T:54-->
This is because many websites include one or more of the many integration buttons, such as "I like" and "twitter this" and Google analytics, adsense etc. Those buttons tell the originating service that you visited that website because you were still logged into their service.

<!--T:55-->
Also note the chapter "Don't use different online identities at the same time." above.

{{Anchor|Do not mix Modes of Anonymity}}
== Do not Mix Anonymity Modes == <!--T:56-->

<!--T:57-->
Let us begin with an overview of the different Modes of Anonymity:

=== Mode 1: Anonymous User; Any Recipient === <!--T:58-->

<!--T:59-->
* Scenario: post anonymously a message in a message board/mailing list/comment field
* Scenario: whistleblower and such
* You are anonymous.
* Your real IP/location stays hidden.
* Location privacy: your location remains secret.

=== Mode 2: User Knows Recipient; Both Use Tor === <!--T:60-->

<!--T:61-->
* Scenario: both sender and recipient know each other and both use Tor.
* They can communicate with each other without any third party being wise to their activity or even to the knowledge that they are communicating with each other.
* You are NOT anonymous.
* Your real IP/location stays hidden.
* Location privacy: your location remains secret.

=== Mode 3: User Non-anonymous and Using Tor; Any Recipient === <!--T:62-->

<!--T:63-->
* Scenario: login with your real name into any services, such as webmail, Twitter, Facebook, etc...
* You are obviously NOT anonymous. As soon as you log into an account where you entered your real name the website knows your identity. Tor can not make you anonymous in these situations.
* Your real IP/location stays hidden.
* Location privacy. Your location remains secret.

=== Mode 4: User Non-anonymous; Any Recipient === <!--T:64-->

<!--T:65-->
* Scenario: normal browsing without Tor.
* You are NOT anonymous.
* Your real IP/location gets revealed.
* Your location gets revealed.

=== Conclusion === <!--T:66-->

<!--T:67-->
It is not wise to combine mode(1) and mode(2). For example, if you have an IM or email account and use that via mode(1), you are advised not to use the same account for mode(2). We have explained previously why this is an issue.

<!--T:68-->
'''It is also not wise to mix two or more modes inside the same Tor session''', as they could share the same exit relay (identity correlation).

<!--T:69-->
It is also possible that other combinations of modes are dangerous and could lead to the leakage of personal information or your physical location.

=== License === <!--T:70-->

<!--T:71-->
License of "Do not mix Modes of Anonymity!": <ref name=adrelicense />

== Do not Change Settings if the Consequences are Unknown == <!--T:72-->
Changing user interface settings for applications, which do not connect to the internet, mostly safe. For example, checking a box "don't show this tip of the day anymore" or "hide this menu bar" will have no effect on anonymity.

<!--T:73-->
Look into the Whonix documentation, if changing the settings you are interested in, is documented or recommended against; try to live with the defaults.

<!--T:74-->
Changing settings for applications, which connect to the internet, even user interface settings, has to be thoroughly reviewed. For example removing a menu bar or using Full Screen in Tor Browser is recommended against. The latter is known to modify the screen size, which is bad for the web fingerprint.

<!--T:75-->
You should only modify network settings with great care if you know their consequences. For example, you should stay away from the advice related to "Firefox Tuning". If you believe the settings are suboptimal, the changes should be proposed upstream, so they get changed for all Tor Browser users with the next release.

{{Anchor|Do not use clearnet and Tor at the same time}}
== Do not Use Clearnet and Tor at the Same Time == <!--T:76-->

<!--T:77-->
Using your non-Tor browser and Tor Browser at the same time, risks that you at some point confuse one for the other and deanonymize yourself.

<!--T:78-->
Using clearnet and Tor at the same time also risks that you connect to a server anonymously and non-anonymously at the same time, which is recommended against. The reason for this is explained in the point below. You never know when you visit the same page anonymously and non-anonymously at the same time, because you only see the url you're visiting, not how many resources are fetched in background. Many different websites are hosted in the same cloud. Services such as google analytics are on the majority of all websites and therefore see a lot anonymous and non-anonymous connections.

<!--T:79-->
If you really want not to follow this recommendation, use at least two different desktops to prevent confusing one browser for another.

{{Anchor|Do not Connect to a Server Anonymously and Non-anonymously at the Same Time}}
== Do not Connect to a Server Anonymously and Non-anonymously at the Same Time == <!--T:80-->

<!--T:81-->
It is highly recommended that you do not connect to any remote server in this manner. That is, do not create a Tor link and a non-Tor link to the same remote server at the same time. In the event your internet connection breaks down (and it will eventually), all your connections will break at the same time and it won't be hard for an adversary to put the pieces together and determine what public IP/location belongs to what Tor IP/connection, potentially identifying you directly. Another attack a webserver could do is increasing or decreasing the speed of the either non-Tor or Tor link and then see if there is a correlation of either connection getting faster or slower, thereby concluding which non-Tor link belongs to which Tor link.

{{Anchor|Do not confuse Anonymity with Pseudonymity}}

== Do not Confuse Anonymity with Pseudonymity == <!--T:83-->

<!--T:84-->
This chapter explains the difference between anonymity and pseudonymity. Word definitions are always a difficult topic because a majority of people has to agree with it.

<!--T:85-->
An anonymous connection is defined as a connection to a destination server, where the destination server has no means to find out the origin (IP/location) of that connection nor to associate and an identifier <ref name=identifier>An identifier could be for example a (Flash) Cookie with an unique number.</ref> to it.

<!--T:86-->
A pseudonymous connection is defined as a connection to a destination server, where the destination server has no means to find out the origin (IP/location) of a connection, but can associate it with an identifier <ref name=identifier />.

<!--T:87-->
In an ideal world, the Tor network, Tor Browser (and the underlying operating system, hardware, physical security, etc.) is perfect. For example the user could fetch a news website and neither the news website nor the website's ISP has any idea if that user has ever contacted the news website before. <ref>Fingerprinting defense is not perfect yet in any browser. There are still open bugs. See [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=needs_information&status=needs_review&status=new&status=reopened&order=priority&col=id&col=summary&col=keywords&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&keywords=tbb-linkability tbb-linkability] and [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=needs_review&status=needs_revision&status=new&status=reopened&order=priority&col=id&col=summary&col=keywords&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&keywords=tbb-fingerprinting tbb-fingerprinting].</ref>

<!--T:88-->
The opposite of this, when using software incorrectly, for example using Firefox instead of the Tor-safe browser Tor Browser, the original (IP/location) of a connection is still hidden, but an identifier (for example Cookies) can be used to make that connection pseudonymous. The destination website could log for example "user with id 111222333444 viewed video title a at time b on date c, video title d at time e at date f.". These information can be used for profiling. Over time these profiles become more and more comprehensive, which reduces anonymity, i.e. in worst case it could lead to de-anonymization.

<!--T:89-->
As soon as someone logs into a website (for example into a forum or e-mail address) with a username the connection is by definition no longer anonymous, but pseudonymous. The origin of the connection (IP/location) is still hidden, but the connection can be associated with an identifier <ref name=identifier />, i.e. in this case, an account name. Identifiers can be used to keep a log of various things. When a user wrote what, date and time of login and logout, what a user wrote, to whom the user wrote, IP address (useless, if it is a Tor exit relay), browser fingerprint etc.

<!--T:90-->
Maxim Kammerer, developer of Liberté Linux <ref>http://dee.su/liberte</ref>, has a interesting different opinion. <ref>[http://forum.dee.su/topic/anon-test-for-ll-on-ipcheck-info#65650000000264003 Quote] [http://www.webcitation.org/6EEeh3pNp (w)]</ref> I don't want to withhold from you:

<!--T:91-->
<blockquote>I have not seen a compelling argument for anonymity, as opposed to pseudonymity. Enlarging anonymity sets is something that Tor developers do in order to publish incremental papers and justify funding. Most users only need to be pseudonymous, where their location is hidden. Having a unique browser does not magically uncover user's location, if that user does not use that browser for non-pseudonymous activities. Having good browser header results on anonymity checkers equally does not mean much, because there are many ways to uncover more client details (e.g., via Javascript oddities).
</blockquote>

== Do not Spread your Own Link First == <!--T:92-->

<!--T:93-->
You created an anonymous blog or hidden service? Great. You have a twitter account with lots of followers, run a big clearnet news page or similar? Great. Do not be tempted to be one of the first ones to advertise your new anonymous project! The more you separate identities, the better. Of course, at some point you may or even must be "naturally" aware of it, but be very careful at this point.

== Do not Open Random Files or Links == <!--T:94-->

<!--T:95-->
Someone sent you an pdf by mail or gave you a link to a pdf? That sender/mailbox/account/key could be compromised and the pdf could be prepared to infect your system. Don't open it with the default tool you were expected use with by the creator. For example, don't open a pdf with a pdf viewer. If the content is public anyway, try using a free online pdf viewer.

== Do not Do (Mobile) Phone Verification == <!--T:96-->

<!--T:97-->
Websites such as Google, Facebook and others will ask for a (mobile) phone number if you login over Tor. Unless you are really clever or have an alternative, you shouldn't do it.

<!--T:98-->
Reason: The number you give away will be logged. The SIM card is most likely registered on your name. And even if not, receiving an SMS gives away your location. Even if you anonymously bought a SIM card and do it from a point far away from your home, there is still a risk: the phone itself. Each time the phone logs into the mobile network, the provider will log the SIM card serial number <ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_mobile_subscriber_identity IMSI]
</ref> AND the phone serial number <ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mobile_Station_Equipment_Identity IMEI]</ref>. If you bought the SIM card anonymously, but not the phone, it is not anonymous, because these two serials will get linked. If you really want to do mobile verification, you need a spot far away from your home, a fresh phone, and a fresh SIM card. Afterwards, you must turn off the phone, and burn both the phone and the SIM card right after doing it.

<!--T:99-->
You could try to find an online service receiving SMS for you. That would work and would be anonymous. The problem is, that it most likely won't work for Google and Facebook, because they actively blacklist such numbers for verification. Or you could try to find someone else receiving the SMS for you, but that would only shift the risk from you to the other person.
