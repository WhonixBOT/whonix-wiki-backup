= Kicksecure Overview =

== Hardening by Default ==

{{kicksecure}} is a hardened operating system designed to be resistant to viruses and malicious code. It is based on hardened Debian in accordance with an advanced multi-layer defense model, thereby providing in-depth security. {{kicksecure}} provides protection from many types of malware in its default configuration with no customization required. 

'''Table:''' ''{{kicksecure}} Hardening Features'' 

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! scope="col"| '''Feature'''
! scope="col"| '''Description'''
|-
! scope="row"| Linux Kernel Runtime <br />Guard (LKRG)
| [[Linux_Kernel_Runtime_Guard_LKRG|LKRG]] kills entire classes of kernel exploits and will be available in the next version.
|-
! scope="row"| TCP ISN CPU <br />Information Leak Protection
| [https://github.com/Whonix/tirdad tirdad] TCP Initial Sequence Numbers Randomization prevents TCP ISN-based CPU Information Leaks; see footnote. <ref><blockquote>The Linux kernel has a side-channel information leak bug. It is leaked in any outgoing traffic. This can allow side-channel attacks because sensitive information about a system's CPU activity is leaked. It may prove very dangerous for long-running cryptographic operations. Research has demonstrated that it can be used for de-anonymization of location-hidden services.</blockquote></ref>
|-
! scope="row"| <code>security-misc</code>
| [https://github.com/Whonix/security-misc <code>security-misc</code>] enhances miscellaneous security settings related to:
* kernel hardening settings as recommended by the Kernel Self Protection Project (KSPP)
* protecting Linux user accounts against brute force attacks
* enforcing [[Dev/Strong Linux User Account Isolation|Strong Linux User Account Isolation]]
* disabling legacy login methods via [[Dev/Strong_Linux_User_Account_Isolation#Console_Lockdown|Console Lockdown]] for improved security hardening
* higher quality randomness (entropy) generation <ref>
Better encryption is achieved via preinstalled random number generators, specifically:
* Loading of the jitterentropy-rng kernel module by default.
* Installation of the user space entropy gathering daemons haveged and jitterentropy-rng by default.
* See also: [[Dev/Entropy]].
</ref>
* systcl
* boot parameters
* various blacklisted kernel modules
* network hardening
* restrictive mount options
* root access restrictions
* access rights restrictions
* application-specific hardening
|-
! scope="row"| Secure network time <br />synchronization using <code>sdwdate</code> 
| Secure Distributed Web Date ([[sdwdate]]) mitigates threats from [[TimeSync#Attacks|time based attacks]] by not relying upon [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/TimeSync insecure NTP].
|-
! scope="row"| Torified <code>apt-get</code> upgrades
| This mitigates against targeted, malicious software upgrades.
|-
! scope="row"| Default security software <br />installations
| Software like [[AppArmor]] and [[Hardened Malloc]] are available by default: <ref>But are not used for everything.</ref>
* [[Hardened Malloc]] mitigates threats from memory corruption attacks. Hardened Malloc can be  used with numerous applications to increase security. <ref>
This is a security-focused general purpose memory allocator providing the malloc API along with various extensions. It provides substantial hardening against heap corruption vulnerabilities.
</ref>
* Available [https://github.com/Whonix?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=apparmor-profile&type=&language= apparmor profiles] for confinement of potentially compromised, high-risk applications.
|-
! scope="row"| [https://github.com/Whonix/open-link-confirmation Open Link Confirmation]
| This is enabled by default and prevents links from being unintentionally opened in supported browsers.

== Planned Features ==

* Encrypted DNS (domain name resolution) <ref>
[https://forums.whonix.org/t/use-dnscrypt-by-default-in-kicksecure-not-whonix/8117 use DNSCrypt by default]
</ref> to mitigate threats from  DNS cache poisoning -- commonly referred to as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_spoofing DNS spoofing] -- [https://dnscrypt.info/ dnscrypt]. <ref>
DNS spoofing results in traffic being diverted to the attacker's computer (or any other computer)
</ref>
* [https://github.com/Whonix/apparmor-profile-everything apparmor-profile-everything]
* [[Hardened-kernel]]

== Usability by Default ==

'''{{kicksecure}} provides usability by default. This means {{kicksecure}} can be used as an everyday multipurpose operating system.''' 

* Package [https://github.com/Whonix/shared-folder-help shared folder help] simplifies shared folder set up for virtual machines. <ref>
Currently only helps using shared folders with VirtualBox. Other virtualizers -- such as KVM shared folder setup -- might be possible in the future
</ref>
* Package [https://github.com/Whonix/usability-misc usabilty-misc] installed by default which improves usability and provides increased flexibility.

'''Popular applications come pre-installed and configured with safe defaults to make them ready for use right out of the box.'''

TODO: document

'''Sensitive user data is protected by state-of-the-art cryptographic tools.'''

* Local user data is protected by Linux Unified Key Setup  ([https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/wikis/home LUKS]) which uses strong encryption to safe-guard your information.<ref>See when [[Full Disk Encryption]] can -- and can not --protect your data.</ref>
* Communications (email) can be both [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption end-to-end encrypted] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature signed] with [[OpenPGP]].

== APT install on Top of Debian ==
<code>sudo apt-get install kicksecure-cli</code> will be possible on bare metal Debian hosts -- in other words, Debian installations can be easily converted into {{kicksecure}} by installing the kicksecure-cli or another {{kicksecure}} Debian package. This is also called [https://forums.whonix.org/t/sudo-apt-get-install-whonix-part-i-distro-morphing/2346 distro-morphing].

Instructions for converting an existing Debian install can be found at [[Kicksecure/Debian]]

== ISO ==

== User Population / Promotion ==

* The security-minded community is larger than the anonymity-minded community. Through {{kicksecure}} we can work on our shared interest in computer security.
* Apply as many security settings by default without breaking usability too much.
* {{kicksecure}} is already the base for [[Whonix]] - Anonymous Operating System.
* This project might migrate to its own domain name kicksecure.com depending on community interest and available resources.

= Help Wanted =

* Does anyone want to help create an installer ISO?
* {{kicksecure}} will hopefully soon become available as a TemplateVM for [https://www.qubes-os.org/ Qubes OS].
