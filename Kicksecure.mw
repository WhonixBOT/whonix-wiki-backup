[https://www.whonix.org {{project_name}}] is based on {{kicksecure}}. {{kicksecure}} is a derivative of Debian and was formally called Hardened Debian.

== ISO ==

* <code>sudo apt-get install kicksecure-cli</code> will be possible on bare metal Debian hosts -- in other words, Debian installations can be easily converted into {{kicksecure}} by installing the kicksecure-cli or another {{kicksecure}} Debian package. This is also called [https://forums.whonix.org/t/sudo-apt-get-install-whonix-part-i-distro-morphing/2346 distro-morphing].

== iPhone and Android Level Security for Linux Desktop Distributions ==
This section details potential future security enhancements for {{Kicksecure}}.

iPhone/Android encompasses a strong security model which includes full system MAC policies, strong application sandboxing, verified boot and more. Many of these security measures are goals of Kicksecure but unfortunately, it is not possible to provide the exact same security level as those platforms are far more developed.

* On popular mobile operating systems (iPhone and Android) a compromised application cannot access data of any other applications. <ref>
Applications are [https://source.android.com/security/app-sandbox sandboxed].
</ref> <ref name=exploitedapp>
In comparison a compromised application on the Linux desktop running under user <code>user</code> has full access to all information that user has access to, including all files, keystrokes and so on. The exception is when [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_access_control mandatory access control (MAC)] is in use and successfully confines that application.
</ref>
* A compromised application is unlikely to gain root. <ref>
Occasionally there are exploits that allow applications to gain root, but as time passes more of these vulnerabilities are being fixed.
</ref> On the Linux desktop the process of Preventing [[Malware]] from [[Root#Prevent_Malware_from_Sniffing_the_Root_Password|Sniffing the Root Password]] is rather cumbersome and unpopular. Therefore any compromised application on the Linux desktop could lead to root compromise which in turn might compromise the bootloader, kernel, or even hardware. It is difficult to detect and remove a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit rootkit].
* The iPhone/Android approach provides strong protection against malware, meaning those platforms are a lot less impacted than Windows or Linux desktops. <ref name=exploitedapp />
* Some vendors add privacy-invasive applications or cause additional security vulnerabilities; some examples are [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_IQ Carrier IQ], Google Play Services or [https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/02/mitigations-are-attack-surface-too.html Samsung KNOX]. Despite this downside, the security model of popular mobile operating systems affords better protection when attempting to prevent any malicious, unapproved party from establishing a foothold in their ecosystem.

iPhones and some Android phones have locked boot loaders that cannot be unlocked <ref>Some devices do allow unlocking the bootloader but not with custom verified boot keys, causing a decrease in security. Other devices (such as the Nexus or Pixel devices) support full verified boot with custom keys that can be used with alternative operating systems.</ref>. This restricts user freedom and makes replacing the operating system impossible without a verified boot bypass exploit. Similarly, they also prevent gaining administrator (root) access. {{Kicksecure}} will not implement these kinds of user freedom restrictions since it is not required nor desirable. The capability to replace the operating system or gain administrator access will remain fully supported. Popular mobile operating systems utilize security technologies which can restrict user freedoms. In contrast, {{Kicksecure}} aims to utilize the same security concepts for the goal of empowering the user and increasing protection from malware.

Steps have already been made to apply mobile device security concepts to desktop Linux such as [https://github.com/Whonix/security-misc security-misc] and [https://github.com/Whonix/apparmor-profile-everything apparmor-profile-everything].

== User Population / Promotion ==

* The security-minded community is larger than the anonymity-minded community. Through {{kicksecure}} we can work on our shared interest in computer security.
* Apply as many security settings by default without breaking usability too much.
* {{kicksecure}} is already the base for [[Whonix]] - Anonymous Operating System.
* This project might migrate to its own domain name kicksecure.com depending on community interest and available resources.
