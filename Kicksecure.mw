= Hardening by Default =

* [[Linux_Kernel_Runtime_Guard_LKRG|Linux Kernel Runtime Guard (LKRG)]] - kills whole classes of kernel exploits (next version)
* [https://github.com/Whonix/tirdad TCP ISN CPU Information Leak Protection]
* [https://github.com/Whonix/security-misc security-misc] (misc security settings)
** Kernel Hardening Settings as recommended by the Kernel Self Protection Project (KSPP). 
** Protect Linux user accounts against brute force attacks
** [[Dev/Strong Linux User Account Isolation|Strong Linux User Account Isolation]]
** [[Dev/Strong_Linux_User_Account_Isolation#Console_Lockdown|Console Lockdown]] disables legacy login methods for improved security hardening.
* [[SecBrowser|SecBrowser â„¢: A Security-hardened, Non-anonymous Browser]]
* higher quality randomness generation <ref>
* Better encryption thanks to preinstalled random number generators. 
** Through loading of the jitterentropy-rng kernel module by default.
** Through installation of the user space entropy gathering daemons haveged and jitterentropy-rng by default.
** See also [[Dev/Entropy]].

* Secure network time synchronization using [[sdwdate]] rather than [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/TimeSync insecure NTP]
* Install security software by default such as [[AppArmor]] and [[Hardened Malloc]] (but not used for everything).
* Available [https://github.com/Whonix?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=apparmor-profile&type=&language= apparmor profiles] for confinement of potentially compromised high risk applications.
* Encrypted DNS (domain name resolution). <ref>

== ISO ==

* <code>sudo apt-get install kicksecure-cli</code> will be possible on bare metal Debian hosts -- in other words, Debian installations can be easily converted into {{kicksecure}} by installing the kicksecure-cli or another {{kicksecure}} Debian package. This is also called [https://forums.whonix.org/t/sudo-apt-get-install-whonix-part-i-distro-morphing/2346 distro-morphing].
* a possible future ISO for installation on hardware depending on community interest and support

== User Population / Promotion ==

* The security-minded community is larger than the anonymity-minded community. Through {{kicksecure}} we can work on our shared interest in computer security.
* Apply as many security settings by default without breaking usability too much.
* {{kicksecure}} is already the base for [[Whonix]] - Anonymous Operating System.
* This project might migrate to its own domain name kicksecure.com depending on community interest and available resources.

= Help Wanted =

* Does anyone want to help create an installer ISO?
* {{kicksecure}} will hopefully soon become available as a TemplateVM for [https://www.qubes-os.org/ Qubes OS].
