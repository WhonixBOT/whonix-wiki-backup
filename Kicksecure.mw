= Kicksecure Overview =

== Hardening by Default ==

{{kicksecure}} is a hardened operating system designed to be resistant to viruses and malicious code. It is based on hardened Debian in accordance with an advanced multi-layer defense model, thereby providing in-depth security. {{kicksecure}} provides protection from many types of malware in its default configuration with no customization required.

! scope="row"| TCP ISN CPU <br />Information Leak Protection
| [https://github.com/Whonix/tirdad tirdad] TCP Initial Sequence Numbers Randomization prevents TCP ISN-based CPU Information Leaks; see footnote. <ref><blockquote>The Linux kernel has a side-channel information leak bug. It is leaked in any outgoing traffic. This can allow side-channel attacks because sensitive information about a system's CPU activity is leaked. It may prove very dangerous for long-running cryptographic operations. Research has demonstrated that it can be used for de-anonymization of location-hidden services.</blockquote></ref>
|-
! scope="row"| <code>security-misc</code>
| [https://github.com/Whonix/security-misc <code>security-misc</code>] enhances miscellaneous security settings related to:
* kernel hardening settings as recommended by the Kernel Self Protection Project (KSPP)
* protecting Linux user accounts against brute force attacks
* enforcing [[Dev/Strong Linux User Account Isolation|Strong Linux User Account Isolation]]
* disabling legacy login methods via [[Dev/Strong_Linux_User_Account_Isolation#Console_Lockdown|Console Lockdown]] for improved security hardening
* higher quality randomness (entropy) generation <ref>
Better encryption is achieved via preinstalled random number generators, specifically:
* Loading of the jitterentropy-rng kernel module by default.
* Installation of the user space entropy gathering daemons haveged and jitterentropy-rng by default.
* See also: [[Dev/Entropy]].

== Planned Features ==

The {{kicksecure}} development roadmap includes various security improvements:
* Encrypted DNS (domain name resolution) using [https://dnscrypt.info/ dnscrypt] <ref>
[https://forums.whonix.org/t/use-dnscrypt-by-default-in-kicksecure-not-whonix/8117 use DNSCrypt by default]
</ref> to mitigate against threats from DNS cache poisoning aka [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_spoofing DNS spoofing]. <ref>
DNS spoofing results in traffic being diverted to the attacker's computer (or any other computer).
</ref>
* [https://github.com/Whonix/apparmor-profile-everything apparmor-profile-everything]
* [[Hardened-kernel]]

== Usability by Default ==

{{kicksecure}} aims to maximize usability by default so it can be utilized as an everyday, multipurpose operating system by users of all skill levels.

= Design and Development Vision =

== Introduction ==

{{project_name}} lead developer, Patrick Schleizer, has opined that while many valuable security guides exist, better security and privacy for the masses necessitates software that applies a majority of hardening instructions by default. 

This is the reason the Free and Open Source {{kicksecure}} and {{project_name}} projects exist; to offer systems that provide a reasonable security hardening baseline, with the in-built flexibility to apply additional hardening dependent upon the user's threat model, hardware capabilities, motivation and knowledge. <ref>It is also accepted that no "perfect configuration" exists that can make a system invulnerable against advanced adversaries. Further, systems that are excessively hardened can become almost unusable except for the most advanced individuals.</ref> The table below provides a further rationale for this position.

'''Table:''' ''Security Guide Limitations'' 

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! scope="col"| '''Factor'''
! scope="col"| '''Description'''
|-
! scope="row"| Initial vulnerability
| When a base system is first installed, various security customizations are not yet applied. All users are vulnerable during this period.
|-
! scope="row"| Recipient insecurity
| Security principles do not exist in a vacuum: 
* Even after applying various security hardening steps, correspondence/network partners might have serious, unaddressed vulnerabilities.
* Some security problems cannot be solved by individuals and may rely on factors in the broader ecosystem. For example: 
** Advanced adversaries perform continual surveillance of all Internet traffic and attempt to attribute collected meta-data to individuals.
** Following a guide to enhance entropy is insufficient if Tor relays being used are insecure. 
** Often personal security can only be improved if the security of others is also improved.
|-
! scope="row"| Reliance on human memory
| Adequate hardening often depends on discovering and remembering to apply all necessary steps from favorite security guides.
|-
! scope="row"| Error risks
| Manually applying security guide steps can lead to mistakes that render the whole procedure ineffective.
|-
! scope="row"| Time requirements
| Security guide steps are often lengthy and cover many different facets of computing. 
|-
! scope="row"| Secure guide discovery
| There are countless security/hardening guides available on the Internet. It is impossible to follow them all and serious research is required to find valuable new resources.
|-
! scope="row"| Incompleteness
| Logically there is not one definitive, all-encompassing security guide. This means some users harden the kernel and install CPU microcode updates, while others rely on sandboxing and implement better random number generators, and so on. Most users miss critical elements because they are simply not aware they exist.
|-
! scope="row"| Currency
| Even the best security guides often contain outdated material. This is especially true for technically detailed or lengthy guides that canvass many topics.
|-
! scope="row"| Publication form
| The form of security guides can effect their utility. For example, those published in blogs and which do not allow comments have grave disadvantages compared to systems relying on collaborative version control software (like git) or collaborative websites (such as a wiki). The reason is contributors can easily fix issues or update contents.
|-
! scope="row"| Popularity
| Security guides which have low popularity cannot effect change and improve security practices if most people are unaware they exist.
|}

For these reasons {{kicksecure}} will remain focused on enabling the majority of (reasonable) hardening settings by default, and allowing additional settings to be easily enforced via installable packages.

== APT install on Top of Debian ==
<code>sudo apt-get install kicksecure-cli</code> will be possible on bare metal Debian hosts -- in other words, Debian installations can be easily converted into {{kicksecure}} by installing the kicksecure-cli or another {{kicksecure}} Debian package. This is also called [https://forums.whonix.org/t/sudo-apt-get-install-whonix-part-i-distro-morphing/2346 distro-morphing].

Instructions for converting an existing Debian install can be found at [[Kicksecure/Debian]]

== ISO ==

== User Population / Promotion ==

* The security-minded community is larger than the anonymity-minded community. Through {{kicksecure}} we can work on our shared interest in computer security.
* Apply as many security settings by default without breaking usability too much.
* {{kicksecure}} is already the base for [[Whonix]] - Anonymous Operating System.
* This project might migrate to its own domain name kicksecure.com depending on community interest and available resources.

= Help Wanted =

* Does anyone want to help create an installer ISO?
* {{kicksecure}} will hopefully soon become available as a TemplateVM for [https://www.qubes-os.org/ Qubes OS].
