[https://www.whonix.org {{project_name}}] is based on {{kicksecure}}. {{kicksecure}} is a derivative of Debian and was formerly called Hardened Debian. [https://forums.whonix.org/t/lets-call-it-freedom-software-rather-than-free-software-or-open-source/6961 Freedom Software] / Open Source.

[[Kicksecure/About|About Kicksecure]].

= Hardening by Default =
{{kicksecure}} is a hardened operating system designed to be resistant to viruses and malicious code. Based on hardened Debian in accordance with an advanced multi-layer defense model. {{kicksecure}} provides protection from many types of malware in its default configuration with no customizations required. 

'''Multi-layered hardening enhancements provides security in-depth by default.'''

* [[Linux_Kernel_Runtime_Guard_LKRG|Linux Kernel Runtime Guard (LKRG)]] - kills whole classes of kernel exploits (next version)
* [https://github.com/Whonix/tirdad TCP ISN CPU Information Leak Protection]
* [https://github.com/Whonix/security-misc security-misc] (misc security settings)
** Kernel Hardening Settings as recommended by the Kernel Self Protection Project (KSPP). 
** Protect Linux user accounts against brute force attacks
** [[Dev/Strong Linux User Account Isolation|Strong Linux User Account Isolation]]
** [[Dev/Strong_Linux_User_Account_Isolation#Console_Lockdown|Console Lockdown]] disables legacy login methods for improved security hardening.
* higher quality randomness generation <ref>
* Better encryption thanks to preinstalled random number generators. 
** Through loading of the jitterentropy-rng kernel module by default.
** Through installation of the user space entropy gathering daemons haveged and jitterentropy-rng by default.
** See also [[Dev/Entropy]].
</ref>
* Secure network time synchronization using [[sdwdate]] (Secure Distributed Web Date) rather than [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/TimeSync insecure NTP] mitigate threats from [[TimeSync#Attacks|time based attacks]].
* Install security software by default such as [[AppArmor]] and [[Hardened Malloc]] (but not used for everything).
** [[Hardened Malloc]] mitigates threats from memory corruption attacks. Hardened Malloc can be  used with numerous applications to increase security. <ref>
This is a security-focused general purpose memory allocator providing the malloc API along with various extensions. It provides substantial hardening against heap corruption vulnerabilities.
</ref>
** Available [https://github.com/Whonix?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=apparmor-profile&type=&language= apparmor profiles] for confinement of potentially compromised high risk applications.
* [https://github.com/Whonix/open-link-confirmation Open Link Confirmation] enabled by default prevents links from being unintentionally opened in supported browsers such as SecBrowser.

= Planned =
* Encrypted DNS (domain name resolution) <ref>
[https://forums.whonix.org/t/use-dnscrypt-by-default-in-kicksecure-not-whonix/8117 use DNSCrypt by default]
</ref> to mitigate threats from  DNS cache poisoning -- commonly referred to as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_spoofing DNS spoofing] -- [https://dnscrypt.info/ dnscrypt]. <ref>
DNS spoofing results in traffic being diverted to the attacker's computer (or any other computer)

* [[Hardened-kernel]]

= Usability by Default =

'''{{kicksecure}} provides usability by default. This means {{kicksecure}} can be used as an everyday multipurpose operating system.''' 

* Package [https://github.com/Whonix/shared-folder-help shared folder help] simplifies shared folder set up for virtual machines. <ref>
Currently only helps using shared folders with VirtualBox. Other virtualizers -- such as KVM shared folder setup -- might be possible in the future
</ref>
* Package [https://github.com/Whonix/usability-misc usabilty-misc] installed by default which improves usability and provides increased flexibility.

'''Popular applications come pre-installed and configured with safe defaults to make them ready for use right out of the box.'''

TODO: document

'''Sensitive user data is protected by state-of-the-art cryptographic tools.'''

* Local user data is protected by Linux Unified Key Setup  ([https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/wikis/home LUKS]) which uses strong encryption to safe-guard your information.<ref>See when [[Full Disk Encryption]] can -- and can not --protect your data.</ref>
* Communications (email) can be both [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption end-to-end encrypted] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature signed] with [[OpenPGP]].

== APT install on Top of Debian ==
<code>sudo apt-get install kicksecure-cli</code> will be possible on bare metal Debian hosts -- in other words, Debian installations can be easily converted into {{kicksecure}} by installing the kicksecure-cli or another {{kicksecure}} Debian package. This is also called [https://forums.whonix.org/t/sudo-apt-get-install-whonix-part-i-distro-morphing/2346 distro-morphing].

== ISO ==

== User Population / Promotion ==

* The security-minded community is larger than the anonymity-minded community. Through {{kicksecure}} we can work on our shared interest in computer security.
* Apply as many security settings by default without breaking usability too much.
* {{kicksecure}} is already the base for [[Whonix]] - Anonymous Operating System.
* This project might migrate to its own domain name kicksecure.com depending on community interest and available resources.

= Help Wanted =

* Does anyone want to help create an installer ISO?
* {{kicksecure}} will hopefully soon become available as a TemplateVM for [https://www.qubes-os.org/ Qubes OS].
