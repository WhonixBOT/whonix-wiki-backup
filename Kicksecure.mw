[[Kicksecure/About|About Kicksecure]].

= Hardening by Default =
{{kicksecure}} is a hardened operating system designed to be resistant to viruses and malicious code. Based on hardened Debian in accordance with an advanced multi-layer defense model. {{kicksecure}} provides protection from many types of malware in its default configuration with no customizations required. 

'''Multi-layered hardening enhancements provides security in-depth by default.'''

* Install security software by default such as [[AppArmor]] and [[Hardened Malloc]] (but not used for everything).
** [[Hardened Malloc]] mitigates threats from memory corruption attacks. Hardened Malloc can be  used with numerous applications to increase security. <ref>
This is a security-focused general purpose memory allocator providing the malloc API along with various extensions. It provides substantial hardening against heap corruption vulnerabilities.

== APT install on Top of Debian ==
<code>sudo apt-get install kicksecure-cli</code> will be possible on bare metal Debian hosts -- in other words, Debian installations can be easily converted into {{kicksecure}} by installing the kicksecure-cli or another {{kicksecure}} Debian package. This is also called [https://forums.whonix.org/t/sudo-apt-get-install-whonix-part-i-distro-morphing/2346 distro-morphing].

== User Population / Promotion ==

* The security-minded community is larger than the anonymity-minded community. Through {{kicksecure}} we can work on our shared interest in computer security.
* Apply as many security settings by default without breaking usability too much.
* {{kicksecure}} is already the base for [[Whonix]] - Anonymous Operating System.
* This project might migrate to its own domain name kicksecure.com depending on community interest and available resources.

* Does anyone want to help create an installer ISO?
* {{kicksecure}} will hopefully soon become available as a TemplateVM for [https://www.qubes-os.org/ Qubes OS].
