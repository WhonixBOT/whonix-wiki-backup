== {{Kicksecure}} Development Goals ==
This section details potential future security enhancements for {{Kicksecure}}.

* On popular mobile operating systems (iPhone and Android) a compromised application cannot access data of any other applications. <ref>
That would require an exploit.
</ref> <ref name=exploitedapp>
In comparison a compromised application on the Linux desktop running under user <code>user</code> has full access to all information that user has access to, including all files, keystrokes and so on. The exception is when [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_access_control mandatory access control (MAC)] is in use and successfully confines that application.
</ref>
* A compromised application is unlikely to gain root. <ref>
Occasionally there are exploits that allow applications to gain root, but as time passes more of these vulnerabilities are being fixed.
</ref> On the Linux desktop the process of Preventing [[Malware]] from [[Root#Prevent_Malware_from_Sniffing_the_Root_Password|Sniffing the Root Password]] is rather cumbersome and unpopular. Therefore any compromised application on the Linux desktop could lead to root compromise which in turn might compromise the bootloader, kernel, or even hardware. It is difficult to detect and remove a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit rootkit].
* The iPhone/Android approach provides strong protection against malware, meaning those platforms are a lot less impacted than Windows or Linux desktops. <ref name=exploitedapp />
* iPhone and many Android vendors purposefully add a lot of spyware; one example is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_IQ Carrier IQ]. The GNU Project states: "[https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-apple.html Apple's Operating Systems Are Malware]" and "[https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-google.html Google's Software is Malware]". In addition, many [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemium freemium] applications spy on their users. Despite this downside, the security model of popular mobile operating systems affords better protection when attempting to prevent any malicious, unapproved party from establishing a foothold in their ecosystem.
* Some Android vendors [https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/02/mitigations-are-attack-surface-too.html introduce mitigations that introduce attack surface].

! Most iPhone / Android devices <ref>Most iPhone / Android phones that are sold by mobile carriers or manufacturers have locked boot loaders, come with spyware installed by default which is non-removable etc. There may be rare exceptions to this rule. Hence "most" and not "all". These exceptions are not the point which shall be made in this comparison. See "Libre Android" column for what is theoretically possible.</ref>
! "Libre Android" <ref>
There is no "Libre Android" at time of writing. It's only a concept to illustrate a point. There is no "perfect" Android distribution. GrapheneOS has verified boot but [https://github.com/copperhead/bugtracker/issues/236 root access is refused in default builds]. Replicant allows root access, but no references were found that Replicant makes use of verified boot yet. It's not relevant to pick any specific Android distribution for the sake of making the point "iPhone and Android Level Security for Linux Desktop Distributions" no specific Android distribution was chosen for this compassion. A "perfect" Android distribution checking all "green yes" is possible in theory. It doesn't exist due to policy decisions. (GrapheneOS vs root in default builds vs device selection / features.) There are no technical reasons for non-existence.

! Can reasonably easily remove internal storage and mount elsewhere for purpose of data recovery or hunting malware / rootkits.
| {{No}} <ref>
This is a hardware limitation. Internal storage is a chip and soldered. Removal is something which most repair shops are incapable. Even if removed, it's not easy to find a device which can read the device without booting from it. Perhaps it could be booted from in another device but that would be besides the point. If the operating system is unbootable due to software issues it will also be unbootable elsewhere. If malware analysis is the goal, then no code from the suspected infected storage device must be executed.

Even worse if full disk encryption was used as per next table entry.

* https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/176276/replace-internal-memory/176277
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device_forensics#Forensic_desoldering

Hence, not "reasonably easily" possible.
</ref>
| {{No}} <ref name=hardware-limitation>Same issue as Most iPhone / Android devices since inheriting the same hardware limitations.</ref>
| {{Yes}} <ref>
Computer (non-mobile) hardware is a lot more flexible. Storage devices can be removed from a computer. Then added to another computer as a secondary disk. While booting from an installation assumed to be clean (not compromised by [the same] malware) it can be attempted to search for malware on the other disk without having to execute any code (risk of malware infection) of the other disk. This is within capability of most repair shops and even hobbits can do it themselves without soldering skills required. Hence, "reasonably easily".
</ref>
| {{Yes}} <ref name=same-as-linux-desktop>Same as Linux Desktop Distributions.</ref>

|-
! Can reasonably easily decrypt internal storage once transferred to a different device if password is known.
| {{No}} <ref>
The masterkey is not stored on the internal storage. [https://source.android.com/security/encryption/full-disk#storing_the_encrypted_key It is stored in hardware.] which is even harder to extract.<br />
<br />
Note: "masterkey" here does not mean "backdoor". This is normal also for most Linux desktop distributions offering full disk encryption. The masterkey is stored somewhere. When entering the password at boot when Linux desktop full disk encryption what gets decrypted is actually not the disk but the masterkey which is then used to decrypt the disk. This is also called luks header. The advantage of the masterkey is that changing the disk encryption password is possible without having to re-encrypt the whole disk (<code>cryptsetup-reencrypt</code>).<br />
<br />
Perhaps it's possible to dump the masterkey if the phone can still be started and can be rooted. But there are no instructions how to do so. Hence, not "reasonably easily".

Quote [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/03/06/1_billion_vulnerable_android_devices_which/ More than a billion hopelessly vulnerable Android gizmos in the wild that no longer receive security updates – research]. The operating system of these devices:

* do not receive security upgrades from the vendor.
* third parties (such as users or the modding community) cannot provide (security) upgrades either due to locked bootloaders which cannot be unlocked due to vendor decision and due to unavailability of a security bug which could unlock the bootloader.
* Even if bootloaders can be unlocked there might not be an adequate operating system upgrade available.

Ability to upgrade (security fixes) devices; replace operating system; boot loader freedom vs boot loader non-freedom:

* iPhones and some Android devices have locked boot loaders that cannot be unlocked. This restricts user freedom and makes replacing the operating system impossible without a verified boot bypass exploit. In case the vendor deprecated security support for the device, the only choices users realistically have is to keep using an insecure device or to buy a device which still has security support. Similarly, locked bootloaders also prevent gaining administrator (root) access.
* Some Android devices do allow unlocking the bootloader but not with custom verified boot keys, causing a decrease in security.
* Some Android devices (such as the Nexus or Pixel devices) support full verified boot with custom keys that can be used with alternative operating systems.

{{Kicksecure}} will not implement these kinds of user freedom restrictions since it is not required nor desirable. The capability to replace the operating system or gain administrator access will remain fully supported. Many popular devices operating systems utilize security technologies which restricts user freedoms. In contrast, {{Kicksecure}} aims to utilize the same security concepts for the goal of empowering the user and increasing protection from malware.

It is theoretically possible to provide some of the same iPhone / Android security concepts on the Linux Desktop too. Steps have already been made to apply mobile device security concepts to desktop Linux such as [https://github.com/Whonix/security-misc security-misc] and [https://github.com/Whonix/apparmor-profile-everything apparmor-profile-everything]. Security technologies like hardened kernels or verified boot used by popular mobile operating systems could also be ported to Linux desktops. Community contributions are gladly welcomed!

== User Population / Promotion ==

* The security-minded community is larger than the anonymity-minded community. Through {{kicksecure}} we can work on our shared interest in computer security.
* Apply as many security settings by default without breaking usability too much.
* {{kicksecure}} is already the base for [[Whonix]] - Anonymous Operating System.
* This project might migrate to its own domain name kicksecure.com depending on community interest and available resources.
