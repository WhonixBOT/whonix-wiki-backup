= Introduction =

The {{project name}} project welcomes security and anonymity-related discourse on the [https://forums.whonix.org {{project name}} forums]. Providing a space for {{project name}} users and developers to co-mingle and communicate enriches the community experience, as well as promoting the continued success of {{project name}} and growth in the user base. While only a minority of users and staff regularly participate in the forums, the sharing of knowledge helps to demystify the platform, increase usability, improve security/anonymity practices, and solve (un)common problems.

This entry is intended to provide recommendations for best practices when using the forums. In addition, it highlights certain topics, behaviors or posts which could breach the Code of Conduct -- potentially resulting in administrative actions like the removal of content or the banning of accounts in extreme cases. This step has become necessary in light of a small minority who persistently treat the forums as a 'free-for-all'. <ref>This refers to chaotic situations or environments that lack rules or structures.</ref> Please maintain professionalism and be considerate to other users.

= Best Practices =

== Avoid Oneboxing for Anchored Links ==

For a definition of oneboxing, see: [https://discourse.transformap.co/t/what-does-oneboxing-mean-in-discourse/723 What does "oneboxing" mean in Discourse?]

When a direct, non-anchored link is posted, for example <code>https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tor_Controller</code>, no special consideration is required. Oneboxing is used automatically, unless a forum poster  wishes to avoid it for some reason. <ref>For example, when posting a large number of links in succession. This can take up unnecessary space in the post depending on the number of references.</ref>

Oneboxing should be avoided if posting an anchored link, such as  <code>https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tor_Controller#Arm</code>. To achieve this, add a space <code> </code> in front of the link. The reason is otherwise the reader might be confused by the onebox, particularly if the descriptive text attached to it is less informative than the anchor.

== Before Creating a New Thread ==

Similar to the [[FAQ#Reporting_Guidelines|Reporting Guidelines]] for bugs, users are recommended to search the [[Documentation]], existing forum topics, and other Internet resources for their issue/area of interest prior to creating a new topic thread. This is considered good forum behavior.

In many cases the issue has already been documented, identified or discussed before, often with a settled answer or solution. The easiest way to search the forums is to use the search link near the top of the page. Forum posts are also indexed by search engines, so combining "{{project_name_short}}" with the relevant query might also find pertinent entries:

<pre>
site:forums.whonix.org What I want to know
</pre>

At their discretion, {{project name}} forum moderators may combine (or split) threads if they are closely (distantly) related. This helps interested readers to remain focused on a solitary issue, thereby improving the productivity of conversations.

== Bumping Old Threads ==

Related to the issue above, it is suggested to 'resuscitate' (bump) old threads on an existing topic. This way all related talking points are in the same location -- reducing the amount of duplicated information and search-related noise in the process. 

One exception to this recommendation may be threads that are already several years old. If the situation has significantly changed, it may be appropriate to start a new thread; for example, if software or protocol changes make older information irrelevant.

== Clean Mediawiki Links ==

Please do not posts links such as <code>https://www.whonix.org/w/index.php?title=Dev/mediawiki&stable=0s</code>. This happens when a forum user shares a link to a page that was edited. These links are undesirable because it is interpreted as a bug (or strange feature) by mediawiki. <ref>TODO: figure out if there is an upstream bug report at the mediawiki bug tracker.</ref> Instead, post 'clean' links like <code>https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/mediawiki</code>. To switch from the 'bad' link to the 'good' link, click the "Page" button on the top left of the screen twice.

== Clickable Quotes ==

A less well known, but useful forum feature concerns embedded quotes. When clicking on a quote posted in the forum, it will expand and show more context.

== Editing Best Practices ==

Some forum posters seek to improve the quality of the forums and their posts by editing earlier entries with additional information. This is unrecommended because there is no notification feature built into the software to announce edits, meaning those who already read your post will be unaware of the changes.

Two better options exist:

# Edit the old post and then make a new post confirming the change, with an additional request the notification be deleted after a short period. Later, either delete the notification post or wait for the forum moderators to do so.
# Create a new post in the existing thread instead. So long as the reply is constructive, this approach is fine.

It is not useful to edit old posts for minor issues, such as typos or grammatical errors.

= Code of Conduct =

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = Effective 8 March, 2019, the following Code of Conduct is in force and applies to all {{project name}} forums. <ref>This section is inspired by the [https://forums.cpanel.net/threads/forum-best-practices-rules-and-guidelines.132889/ cpanel forums Code of Conduct].</ref>
}}


This Code of Conduct is deemed necessary to maintain a welcoming community while combating the efforts of detractors who seek to cause disruption.

First and foremost, please be considerate of others and adhere to standards of decorum. For full transparency, examples of conduct that could result in being banned or having content removed (without notice), include:

* Posting of unrelated content in a forum thread ('thread pollution'); for example, asking about email encryption in a thread related to post-Tor tunnels.
* Posting content completely unrelated to {{project_name}}, computer security, anonymity or software/hardware in general; for example, posting about World Series baseball.
* Posting account or server passwords.
* Posting of copyrighted material.
* Belittling, insulting or threatening other users.
* Posting of obscene, vulgar or pornographic material.
* Creating posts which are libelous, defamatory or illegal; for example, vicious and unfounded attacks on a person's character, or discussions about anonymous [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test pentesting].
* 'Machine-gun posting' - making multiple, limited-value posts in the same thread within a short period, or creating multiple threads regarding a solitary issue.
* Posting intentionally misleading or damaging information; for example, malicious claims made against the {{project name}} project without any foundation.
* Posting advertisements, spam, employment offers, or links that promote sites or which are otherwise harmful; for example, links to compromised/false phishing sites or services.
* The posting of any other material or opinion which is deemed disruptive by moderators.

If users are in any doubt, they should '''NOT''' post the relevant material or opinion. Be aware that any information posted here is freely visible to the public and also routinely monitored by moderators in accordance with these provisions. Enforcement of these rules are at the discretion of forum moderators.

By using the {{project name}} forums, you agree to these terms and conditions. {{project name}} reserves the right to change these terms and conditions, the content of these forums, access rights to these forums, or any other part of these forums at any time.

= FAQ =

Common questions raised in the {{project name}} forums are answered below.

'''Why was my post moved by a moderator?'''

In this case, the post probably touched on a subject that was not related to the current topic. To avoid confusion and to keep the forums productive, the post was either moved to an existing thread or used to create a new topic discussion.

'''Where did my post/thread dissapear to?'''

Possible answers:

# It was moved to a different sub-topic.
# Multiple users flagged the post/thread. When that happens, the post is automatically hidden from view until until a moderator has reviewed the post.
# It was removed for legal reasons, see: [[Limitations_on_Free_Speech_on_Whonix_Website|Limitations on Free Speech on {{project name}} Website]]
# To clarify the thread/topic, the title may have been changed. When this occurs the thread cannot be located with the former title.
