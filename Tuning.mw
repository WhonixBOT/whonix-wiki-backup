= Tuning =

== Introduction ==

'''Everything absolutely optional. Mostly largely untested!'''

At the top of the ''Tuning chapter'' are the easier tuning steps. The farther you go down, the more skill will be required.

== Increase Virtual Machine RAM ==

If [[Protocol-Leak-Protection_and_Fingerprinting-Protection#Less_important_identifiers|less important identifiers]] are not important to you, and this is most likely very unimportant, you could use VirtualBox settings and increase the RAM for your Virtual Machine(s). {{workstation_product_name}} will profit most, if you run into low RAM. Also Whonix-Gateway could profit if you are creating big numbers of circuits and keep Tor busy. You can check how much RAM is free using ''free -m'' in Terminal.

== More CPU cores ==

On systems with multi-core processors, if [[Protocol-Leak-Protection_and_Fingerprinting-Protection#Less_important_identifiers|less important identifiers]] are not important to you, and this is most likely unimportant, you could increase the number of cores available to the Virtual Machine(s) in VirtualBox settings.

== Removing packages ==

For example you could experiment with uninstalling Nepomuk and virtuoso.

== Replacing Desktop Environment ==
See [[Other_Desktop_Environments|Other Desktop Environments]].

== Synthetic CPU ==
If [[Protocol-Leak-Protection_and_Fingerprinting-Protection#Less_important_identifiers|less important identifiers]] are not important to you, you could try if deactivating the Synthetic CPU increases performance for you.

{{CodeSelect|code=
VBoxManage modifyvm "Whonix-Workstation" --synthcpu off
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
VBoxManage modifyvm "Whonix-Gateway" --synthcpu off
}}

== Nested paging and VPIDs ==
You could increase performance by using Nested paging and/or VPIDs. It is unknown, if that may decrease security or stability. See VirtualBox manual: [http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch10.html#nestedpaging Nested paging and VPIDs] for more information.

{{CodeSelect|code=
vboxmanage modifyvm {{workstation_product_name}} --largepages on
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
vboxmanage modifyvm Whonix-Gateway --largepages on
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
vboxmanage modifyvm {{workstation_product_name}} --vtxvpid on
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
vboxmanage modifyvm Whonix-Gateway --vtxvpid on
}}

== Hardware-accelerated graphics ==

Requires Guest Additions, therefore not recommended, see above. Can increase performance.

See VirtualBox manual: [https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#guestadd-3d Hardware-accelerated graphics].

== Memory ballooning, Page Fusion, Memory overcommitment ==

Requires Guest Additions, therefore not recommended, see above. Can increase performance.

See VirtualBox manual: [https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#idp18673360 Memory overcommitment].

== 64 bit architecture ==

Several methods. The last method is probably the most useful one.

Maybe it would enhance security and/or performance by using an amd64 kernel. How much sense that makes when the rest of the system is still 32 bit?

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install linux-image-amd64
}}

You could try to [http://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch/HOWTO Debian Multiarch HOWTO].

Or better create amd64 [[BuildDocumentation|builds yourself from source]].

== Optimized builds ==

Since the concept behind Whonix is not tied to anything, you could create your own implementation. Perhaps using Gentoo with optimized build flags for your system. See [[Dev/Technical Introduction#Whonix Framework|Whonix Framework]], [[OneVM]] and [[Hardened Gentoo TG]].

== PCI passthrough ==

Might greatly improve graphics performance. Might have security implications.

Essentially this feature allows to directly use physical PCI devices on the host by the guest even if host doesn't have drivers for this particular device. See VirtualBox Manual: [http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch09.html#pcipassthrough PCI passthrough].
