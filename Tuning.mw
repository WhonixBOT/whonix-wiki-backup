== Introduction ==

'''Everything absolutely optional. Mostly largely untested!'''

At the top of the ''Tuning chapter'' are the easier tuning steps. The farther you go down, the more skill will be required.

== Increase Virtual Machine RAM ==

If [[Protocol-Leak-Protection_and_Fingerprinting-Protection#Less_important_identifiers|less important identifiers]] are not important to you, and this is most likely very unimportant, you could use VirtualBox settings and increase the RAM for your Virtual Machine(s). {{workstation_product_name}} will profit most, if you run into low RAM. Also {{gateway_product_name}} could profit if you are creating big numbers of circuits and keep Tor busy. You can check how much RAM is free using ''free -m'' in Terminal.

== More CPU cores ==

On systems with multi-core processors, if [[Protocol-Leak-Protection_and_Fingerprinting-Protection#Less_important_identifiers|less important identifiers]] are not important to you, and this is most likely unimportant, you could increase the number of cores available to the Virtual Machine(s) in VirtualBox settings.

== Nested paging and VPIDs ==
You could increase performance by using large and/or VPIDs. It is unknown, if that may decrease security or stability. See VirtualBox manual: [http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch10.html#nestedpaging Nested paging and VPIDs] for more information.

vboxmanage modifyvm {{workstation_product_name_short}}-XFCE --vtxvpid on
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
vboxmanage modifyvm {{gateway_product_name_short}}-XFCE --vtxvpid on
}}

== Hardware-accelerated graphics ==
Bad for security.

See VirtualBox manual: [https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#guestadd-3d Hardware-accelerated graphics].

== Memory ballooning, Page Fusion, Memory overcommitment ==
Memory ballooning is bad for security, see [[Dev/KVM#memory_balloon|this reference]] (it is written in context of KVM but the research also applies to any other virtualizer unless it has specific protection against that which would need to be stated somewhere).

Other settings for security?

See VirtualBox manual: [https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#guestadd-memory-usage Memory overcommitment].

== Undocumented Tuning Settings ==
There are probably more tuning related settings. Undocumented at {{project name}}. Documented in VirtualBox manual but not bundled as a chapter "tuning".

View all settings.

{{CodeSelect|code=
vboxmanage showvminfo Whonix-Workstation-XFCE
}}

Learn about all of these settings. Read [https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ VirtualBox manual].

== Optimized builds ==

Since the concept behind {{project_name}} is not tied to anything, you could create your own implementation. Perhaps using Gentoo with optimized build flags for your system. See [[Dev/Technical Introduction#{{project_name}} Framework|{{project_name}} Framework]], [[UniStation]] and [[Hardened Gentoo TG]].

== PCI passthrough ==

Might greatly improve graphics performance. Bad for security as VMs should not have direct access to physical hardware.

Essentially this feature allows to directly use physical PCI devices on the host by the guest even if host doesn't have drivers for this particular device. See VirtualBox Manual: [http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch09.html#pcipassthrough PCI passthrough].
