= Manually updating Tor Browser (stable version) =
(1) Go to https://www.torproject.org/ and/or http://idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion/ and download the Tor Browser Bundle for Linux 32 bit. Store it in ''/home/user/''.

(2) Read https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en and/or http://idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en and learn about gpg verification.

(3) Go to https://www.torproject.org/docs/signing-keys.html.en and/or http://idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion/docs/signing-keys.html.en to get the gpg keys.

(4) Verify the Tor Browser Bundle download.

(5) Go into ''/home/user/'' with the file manger. (Dolphin)

(6) Extract the Tor Browser Bundle. Right click on the downloaded archive -> extract -> extract archive here.

(7) In case you downloaded another version than ''en-US'', rename the tor-browser_''lang'' folder to ''tor-browser_en-US''. This is important, because the paths in the following script are hardcoded.

(8) Go into the ''/home/user/tor-browser_en-US'' folder.

(9) Delete ''start-tor-browser'' or move it to the ''/home/user/tor-browser_en-US/Docs'' folder.

(10) Create a new file within the ''/home/user/tor-browser_en-US/'' folder called ''start-tor-browser'' with the following content.

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
## Whonix Tor Browser start script

export TOR_SKIP_LAUNCH=1
    
cd ~
~/tor-browser_en-US/App/Firefox/firefox --profile ~/tor-browser_en-US/Data/profile
    
## End of Whonix Tor Browser start script
</pre>

(11) Make the ''start-tor-browser'' script executable. Right click on ''start-tor-browser'' -> Properties -> Permissions -> enable the ''Is executable'' box -> ok.

(12) Go to ''/home/user/tor-browser_en-US/Data/profile/'' and create a file ''user.js'' with the following content.

<pre>## Begin of patched user.js.

## If you edit this file while Firefox is running, your changes will be
## overwritten, when you close Firefox.

## How to create the user.js network settings:
## 1. Make a backup of prefs.js.
## 1. Start Tor Browser with the patched start script.
## 2. Apply proxy settings using the Tor Button settings dialog..
## 3. Make a diff from the old and the new pref.js.
## 4. Copy the relevant changes to user.js.

## network settings
## (Are now set in /etc/environment - or not...)
## (See /etc/environment.)
user_pref("extensions.torbutton.use_privoxy", false);
user_pref("extensions.torbutton.settings_method", "custom");
user_pref("extensions.torbutton.socks_host", "192.168.0.10");
user_pref("extensions.torbutton.socks_port", 9100);
user_pref("network.proxy.socks", "192.168.0.10");
user_pref("network.proxy.socks_port", 9100);
user_pref("extensions.torbutton.custom.socks_host", "192.168.0.10");
user_pref("extensions.torbutton.custom.socks_port", 9100);

## End of Whonix user.js.
</pre>

(13) If you want to make 100% sure you never have Tor over Tor, you must shut down Whonix-Gateway while doing the following.

(14) Delete /home/user/my_tor-browser_en-US/App/tor.

(15) If there is '''no''' green Vidalia icon in the task bar, everything is fine.

(16) Start Tor Browser and run

<pre>ps aux | grep tor</pre>

If you see something like.

<pre>109 /usr/sbin/tor</pre>

Or.

<pre>/home/user/my_tor-browser_en-US/App/tor</pre>

Something went wrong and you're running Tor over Tor, which is recommended against.

(17) If the tests results are as expected, everything went fine.

(18) Don't forget to restart Whonix-Gateway, if you shut it down in step (13).

(19) Done.
