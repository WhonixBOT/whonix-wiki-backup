= Introduction =

The Whonix wiki strongly recommends that all users learn more about [[Tor_Browser|Tor Browser basics]] and [[DoNot|Tips on Remaining Anonymous]] before undertaking activities on the Whonix platform that necessitate strong anonymity.

Modern Tor Browser releases are generally easy to install and update, leading most users to have a comfortable and reliable experience over long periods. However, before the introduction of [[Tor_Browser#Tor_Browser_Internal_Updater|Tor Browser's internal updater]], this was a difficult task which required the renaming (or deletion) of the old Tor Browser folder before the new version was extracted. Therefore, some users will have little concept of how Tor Browser functions "under the hood", causing problems when attempting a manual installation (particularly on the host).

== Prerequisite Knowledge ==

This procedure assumes basic knowledge of:

* '''Software Verification:''' Users are expected to know how to PGP-verify the Tor Browser package, using the associated file signature and Tor signing keys (relevant links are provided). <ref>Whonix is not a standalone package but a complete OS. Whonix has a small team while torproject.org has a much larger community and dedicated, paid support staff. Therefore, Whonix users are expected to learn Tor Browser basics in the first instance.</ref>
* '''Troubleshooting:''' If Tor Browser problems occur in Whonix such as webpages failing to resolve, then:
** Users are expected to perform the same test on the host. This step helps to determine whether the problem is related to Whonix or not. 
** In addition, users should search for the problem on [https://trac.torproject.org/ torproject.org's bug tracker] and report a bug upstream if it has not been notified yet. In that case, when upstream (TPO) fixes the issue, the issue will most likely also get fixed in Whonix.

== Whonix Bugs ==

Sometimes the [[Tor_Browser#Tor_Browser_Downloader_by_Whonix|Whonix Tor Browser Downloader]] breaks, because torproject.org changes the way Tor Browser can be downloaded or verified. Since this program is maintained by the [[Team|Whonix team]], The Tor Project is not responsible for necessary fixes. Any bugs should therefore be discussed in the Whonix [https://forums.whonix.org User Help Forum] or [https://phabricator.whonix.org/search/query/9YB5CfmXxpAG/#R Bug Tracker].

To date, no bugs were ever discovered in Tor Browser that were directly related to Whonix code and which might cause serious problems such as website pages failing to load.

Users are recommended to regularly read the [https://blog.torproject.org Tor Project blog] to stay in tune with Tor / Tor Browser news and latest release information.

= Manually Downloading Tor Browser =

'''Whonix'''

If Tor Browser is not installed, then it can be downloaded by using Firefox-ESR. Only complete this action for downloading Tor Browser and nothing else.

| text       ='''Note:''' From Whonix 14, Firefox-ESR is no longer installed by default and must be [[#Manually_Download_and_Install_Tor_Browser|manually installed]] via Whonix-Workstation Konsole.
}}


'''Non-Whonix Platforms'''

If Firefox is available and Tor Browser is to be installed on a non-Whonix platform, proceed to [[#Manually_Download_and_Install_Tor_Browser|Manually Download and Install Tor Browser]]. Otherwise, first install Firefox on the respective platform and configure the setting for clearnet onion connections, if desired.

== Install Firefox-ESR Web Browser ==

''' 1.''' Install Firefox-ESR.

In Whonix-Workstation Konsole, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install firefox-esr
}}

''' 2. ''' Configure clearnet onion service connections.

If users intend to connect to the Tor Project's onion service to download Tor Browser, then adjust the following Firefox-ESR setting to permit these connections.  

In Firefox address bar: <code>about:config</code> -> <code>I accept the risk!</code> -> <code>network.dns.blockDotOnion</code> -> <code>toggle to false</code>.
