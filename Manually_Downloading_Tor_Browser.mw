|description=Manually Updating Tor Browser in case Whonix's torbrowser updater is broken
}}

= Introduction =
The Pre Install Advice page contains a chapter [[Pre_Install_Advice#Tor_Browser_Bundle|recommending]] to learn the basics about torproject.org's <u>T</u>or <u>B</u>rowser <u>B</u>undle (TBB) before starting with Whonix.

For example at time of writing the recommended way by The Tor Project to update TBB is still to rename your old folder (for example /home/user/tor-browser_en-US to something else) (or delete it) and to extract the newly downloaded version. You won't know about such glitches, if you don't know the basics, namely how to use TBB on the host.

General questions like how verification of TBB works, what that's good for etc. are off topic here, since we have to unfortunately regard this as basic knowledge. Whonix isn't a standalone package in that sense and just has a small team while torproject.org has a much wider community and dedicated support staff. Again, you need to imagine you know nothing about Whonix and need to learn basics about TBB in the first place.

If you are experiencing an issue with Tor Browser in Whonix (for example, some page does not load), please check first if you experience the same issue with TBB on your host. If that is the case, Whonix isn't responsible for this error. If you care to see the bug fixed, you are advised to search torproject.org's [http://trac.torproject.org/ bug tracker] and to open a bug upstream if no one else reported the issue yet. When upstream (The Tor Project) fixes the issue, the issue will most likely also get fixed in Whonix.

Sometimes Whonix's Tor Browser Updater breaks, because torproject.org changes the way TBB can be downloaded/verified. Since Whonix's Tor Browser Updater is maintained by the Whonix team, The Tor Project is not responsible for it and it and therefore should be discussed in Whonix's User Help Forum or Whonix's Bug Tracker.

At time of writing, there were never any errors in Tor Browser (such as when a page doesn't load) caused by Whonix.

Check https://blog.torproject.org.

= General information about Tor Browser in Whonix =
See [[Tor Browser]].

= Manually updating Tor Browser =
(1) Go to https://www.torproject.org/ and download the Tor Browser Bundle for Linux 32 bit. Store it in ''/home/user/''.

(2) Read https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en and learn about gpg verification.

(3) Go to https://www.torproject.org/docs/signing-keys.html.en to get the gpg keys.

(4) Verify the Tor Browser Bundle download.

(5) Go into ''/home/user/'' with the file manger. (Dolphin)

(6) If you still have the old version of TBB opened (because you are probably reading this from the old TBB), close it. (copy the next steps to Kwrite if necessary)

(7) Rename your old TBB ''/home/user/tor-browser_en-US'' to something else. 

(8) Extract the Tor Browser Bundle. Right click on the downloaded archive -> extract -> extract archive here.

(9) In case you downloaded another version than ''en-US'', rename the tor-browser_''lang'' folder to ''tor-browser_en-US''. This is important, because the paths are hardcoded.

(10) Done.

(11) To start Tor Browser, got to your ''/home/user/tor-browser_en-US'' folder and double click ''start-tor-browser''. Or type in terminal.

/home/user/tor-browser_en-US/start-tor-browser
