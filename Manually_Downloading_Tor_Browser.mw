= Introduction =
The Computer Security Education page contains a chapter [[Computer_Security_Education#Tor_Browser|recommending]] to learn the basics about torproject.org's Tor Browser before starting with Whonix.

For example, in past before the introduction of [[Tor_Browser#Tor_Browser_Internal_Updater|Tor Browser's Internal Updater]], the recommended way by <u>T</u>he Tor <u>P</u>r<u>o</u>ject (TPO) to update Tor Browser was to rename your old folder (for example /home/user/tor-browser_en-US to something else) (or delete it) and to extract the newly downloaded version. You won't know about such glitches, if you don't know the basics, namely how to use Tor Browser on the host.

General questions like how verification of Tor Browser works, what that's good for etc. are off topic here, since we have to unfortunately regard this as basic knowledge. Whonix is not a standalone package in that sense and just has a small team while torproject.org has a much wider community and dedicated support staff. Again, you need to imagine you know nothing about Whonix and need to learn basics about Tor Browser in the first place.

If you are experiencing an issue with Tor Browser in Whonix (for example, some page does not load), please check first if you experience the same issue with Tor Browser on your host. If that is the case, Whonix is not responsible for this error. If you care to see the bug fixed, you are advised to search [https://trac.torproject.org/ torproject.org's bug tracker] and to open a bug upstream if no one else reported the issue yet. When upstream (TPO) fixes the issue, the issue will most likely also get fixed in Whonix.

Sometimes [[Tor_Browser#Tor_Browser_Downloader_by_Whonix|Whonix's Tor Browser Downloader]] breaks, because torproject.org changes the way Tor Browser can be downloaded/verified. Since Whonix's Tor Browser Downloader is maintained by the [[Team|Whonix team]], The Tor Project is not responsible for it and it and therefore should be discussed in [https://forum.swhonix.org Whonix's User Help Forum] or [https://phabricator.whonix.org/search/query/9YB5CfmXxpAG/#R Whonix's Bug Tracker].

At time of writing, there were never any errors in Tor Browser (such as when a page doesn't load) caused by Whonix.

You can find out the latest Tor Browser version by checking https://blog.torproject.org. For general information about Tor Browser in Whonix, see [[Tor Browser]].

= Manually Downloading Tor Browser =

== Introduction ==

'''Whonix'''

If Tor Browser is not installed, then it can be downloaded by using Firefox-ESR. Only complete this action for downloading Tor Browser and nothing else.

{{mbox

| text       ='''Note:''' From Whonix 14, Firefox-ESR is no longer installed by default and must be [[#Manually_Download_and_Install_Tor_Browser|manually installed]] via Whonix-Workstation Konsole.
}}


'''Non-Whonix Platforms'''

If Firefox is available and Tor Browser is to be installed on a non-Whonix platform, proceed to [[#Manually_Download_and_Install_Tor_Browser|Manually Download and Install Tor Browser]]. Otherwise, first install Firefox on the respective platform and configure the setting for clearnet onion connections, if desired.

== Install Firefox-ESR Web Browser ==

''' 1.''' Install Firefox-ESR.

In Whonix-Workstation Konsole, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install firefox-esr
}}

''' 2. ''' Configure clearnet onion service connections.

If users intend to connect to the Tor Project's onion service to download Tor Browser, then adjust the following Firefox-ESR setting to permit these connections.  

In Firefox address bar: <code>about:config</code> -> <code>I accept the risk!</code> -> <code>network.dns.blockDotOnion</code> -> <code>toggle to false</code>.
