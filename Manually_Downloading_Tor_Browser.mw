= Introduction =
The Pre Install Advice page contains a chapter [[Pre_Install_Advice#Tor_Browser_Bundle|recommending]] to learn the basics about torproject.org's <u>T</u>or <u>B</u>rowser <u>B</u>undle (TBB) before starting with Whonix.

For example, in past before the introduction of [[Tor_Browser#Tor_Browser_Internal_Updater|Tor Browser's Internal Updater]], the recommended way by <u>T</u>he Tor <u>P</u>r<u>o</u>ject (TPO) to update TBB was to rename your old folder (for example /home/user/tor-browser_en-US to something else) (or delete it) and to extract the newly downloaded version. You won't know about such glitches, if you don't know the basics, namely how to use TBB on the host.

General questions like how verification of TBB works, what that's good for etc. are off topic here, since we have to unfortunately regard this as basic knowledge. Whonix isn't a standalone package in that sense and just has a small team while torproject.org has a much wider community and dedicated support staff. Again, you need to imagine you know nothing about Whonix and need to learn basics about TBB in the first place.

If you are experiencing an issue with Tor Browser in Whonix (for example, some page does not load), please check first if you experience the same issue with TBB on your host. If that is the case, Whonix isn't responsible for this error. If you care to see the bug fixed, you are advised to search [https://trac.torproject.org/ torproject.org's bug tracker] and to open a bug upstream if no one else reported the issue yet. When upstream (TPO) fixes the issue, the issue will most likely also get fixed in Whonix.

Sometimes [[Tor_Browser#Tor_Browser_Updater_.28Whonix.29|Whonix's Tor Browser Updater]] breaks, because torproject.org changes the way TBB can be downloaded/verified. Since Whonix's Tor Browser Updater is maintained by the [[Authorship|Whonix team]], The Tor Project is not responsible for it and it and therefore should be discussed in [https://forum.swhonix.org Whonix's User Help Forum] or [https://phabricator.whonix.org/maniphest/?statuses=open%28%29&projects=PHID-PROJ-qvh6lv6dnn4kysaqphuq#R Whonix's Bug Tracker].

At time of writing, there were never any errors in Tor Browser (such as when a page doesn't load) caused by Whonix.

You can find out the latest Tor Browser version by checking https://blog.torproject.org. For general information about Tor Browser in Whonix, see [[Tor Browser]].
