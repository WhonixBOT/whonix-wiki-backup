"Looks fine from a cursory check."

== Audit ==
None, but that doesn't mean anything. There is no audit of Tails, Liberté Linux, etc. either. At the time of writing there were no public published audits for Debian, Ubuntu, Qubes OS, etc. either.

We are not aware of any serious research about any of such distributions in [http://freehaven.net/anonbib/ anonbib]. No expert such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Schneier Bruce Schneier] for cryptography exists for security-focused operating system review.

Audit is a word. But what does audit actually mean? Every audit that is being made has a previously defined, limited scope. There are no all-encompassing audits.

More food for thought on audits. As an example, has GNU wget been audited? What is an audit? Is it an professional company, providing software security audits as a service? Some kind of certification? There is no such entity in the Freedom Software Open Source ecosystem at time of writing. There are no quality seals for Linux distributions.

If you know examples, please get in contact or edit this section. Would it be reasonable to expect a reputable organization or individual making statements such as "GNU wget has been audited and no security vulnerabilities were found"? It usually happens the other way around. When someone reviews the source code and finds nothing wrong, nothing will be reported. On the other hand, if a vulnerability has been found, that's worth some fame. However, anyone who claimed beforehand to have found no security issues wouldn't get better reputation. On the contrary, look bad for previously making statements about not having found security issues.

If you make an audit, please edit this section or get in contact so it will be linked here.
