== Audits ==

* [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-March/023531.html cursory check of TorBOX by creator of JanusVM]

== Official expert review ==

None, but that doesn't mean anything. There is nothing of that kind about Tails or LibertÃ© Linux as well. Is there even something of that kind about Debian, Ubuntu or Qubes OS?

We are not aware of any serious research about any of such distributions in [http://freehaven.net/anonbib/ anonbib]. No one like [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Schneier Bruce Schneier] for cryptography exists for distribution review.

More food for thought on the audit, users are sometimes asking for. Has GNU wget been audited? What is an audit? Is it an professional company, providing software security audits as a service? Some kind of certification? In the Open Source world, adrelanos hasn't found such a thing. If you know examples, please get in contact or edit this section. Do you expect to come someone reputable come up, say something like "I carefully audited GNU wget and haven't found any security vulnerabilities"? It looks like it works quite the other way around. When someone audits the code and finds nothing wrong, nothing will be reported. On the other hand, if a vulnerability has been found, that's worth some fame. The one who claimed beforehand to have found nothing, however, wouldn't get better reputation.

'''If you make an audit, please edit this section or get in contact so it will be linked here.'''

== Older places of people talking about Whonix ==

A section to collect everyone discussing Whonix anywere. It's nice to see what people think and say about Whonix. If they don't give feedback directly, we still have a secondary feedback source. Most links are found through googeling "TorBOX" or "https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorBOX".

Old questions on torproject.org:

Unsorted:

* [http://utup22qsb6ebeejs.onion/?x=entry:entry120219-220943 "My Hidden Blog"]; (adrelanos) small blog entry; unfortunately not much information or feedback
* [https://thepiratebay.se/tag/torbox Whonix on theprivatebay.de]; (adrelanos) Interesting but pointless imo. 6 seeders right now in total. People should not even trust us but they trust the packager of that torrent. We are not against sharing through torrent. It's all Free Software. As long we do not offer trusted and gpg signed builds, however I recommend against downloading through torrent.
* [https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=site%3Awilderssecurity.com+TorBOX Whonix on wilderssecurity.com]; few threads
* [http://ra.fnord.at/2011/05/easy-and-secure-anonymous-internet-usage/ ra's blog]; Search for "TorBOX that they have".; Negative feedback.
