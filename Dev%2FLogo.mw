== Facebook Cover Photo ==

<blockquote>
What are the dimensions for my Page's cover photo?

Cover photos are 851 pixels wide and 315 pixels tall. If you upload an image that's smaller than these dimensions, it will be stretched to this larger size. The image you upload must be at least 399 pixels wide and 150 pixels tall.

To get the fastest load times for your Page, upload an sRGB JPG file that's 851 pixels wide, 315 pixels tall and less than 100 kilobytes. For images with your logo or text, you may get a higher quality result by using a PNG file.

= Logo Contest Draft =
== Requirements ==
* Free licence, compatible with GPL3+.
* Source in SVG format.
* An image with an approximate 1:1 ratio, like the [onion logo](https://media.torproject.org/image/www-images/onion.jpg).
* Plus the same image along with the "Tails" word either:
* merged with the image as in the [Tor logo](https://media.torproject.org/image/www-images/tor-logo.jpg);
* on the side of the image.
* The "Tails" name must be spelled with an uppercase "T" only, and lowercase "ails".
* The image should convey the ideas behind Tails: secrecy, privacy, anonymity, mystery, simplicity (Tails is ready-to-use).
* The logo has to be a bit serious, but not sad.
* Until now we reuse the colors from Tor (green and purple), but this can be changed.
* We cannot reuse directly the Tor or Debian logo, but evoking it is ok (use Tor colors, or evoking the Debian swirl).
* The image should be suited to print on nice stickers that people want to have on their computers, and on t-shirts that people are happy to wear.
* Make sure that the fonts that you use are compatible with GPL3+. To be on the safe side, use [fonts available in Debian main](http://pkg-fonts.alioth.debian.org/review/debian-font-review.html), otherwise we will ask you to prove their compatibility with GPL3+.

== Complementary materials ==
As the logo will be used in quite different places, we encourage you to submit complementary materials. These are not strict requirements but will help us evaluate your proposal better. Besides, if your logo is chosen, we will need them anyway before we are able to put it to use publicly.

These complementary materials are:

* A banner for the website. The current one is 986x60px, but the new one could be higher, maybe up to 150px.
* A [splash screen for boot](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/tails/plain/data/splash.png). Must be 640x480px with a black background, 8-bit/RGBA. It has to be distinguishable by the user as Tails, but discrete enough not to attract too much attention from other people around.
* A color palette for the website, if it needs to be adapted to match the logo.
* Fonts to be used to create other material matching the logo.
* A [CSS patch](http://git.tails.boum.org/tails/tree/wiki/src/local.css) for colors and fonts on the website, if you are into CSS.
* A grayscale version of the logo.

== Calendar ==

* **XXst of XXX**: Deadline for sending proposals to XXX forum thread XXX
* **Xth of XXX**: The winner is announced.
* **XXth of XXX**: All the complementary materials have to be ready so we have time to include them in Tails 1.0. The designer of the winning logo is strongly encouraged to do this work, before or after the deadline for proposals.
