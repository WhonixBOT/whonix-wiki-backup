== Facebook Profile Picture ==
<blockquote>
What are the dimensions of my Page's profile picture?

Page profile pictures are square and display at 160x160 pixels on your Page. The photo you upload must be at least 180x180 pixels. We recommend uploading a square image. Rectangular images will be cropped to fit a square. Your Page's profile picture will also display next to your Page's name around Facebook to represent your Page.

You can be creative with how your Page's profile picture and cover photo go together. On your Page, the profile picture is located 16 pixels from the left side of your cover photo and 176 pixels from the top of your cover photo.

og:image This is an image associated with your media. We suggest that you use an image of at least 1200x630 pixels.

== Facebook Cover Photo ==

<blockquote>
What are the dimensions for my Page's cover photo?

Cover photos are 851 pixels wide and 315 pixels tall. If you upload an image that's smaller than these dimensions, it will be stretched to this larger size. The image you upload must be at least 399 pixels wide and 150 pixels tall.

To get the fastest load times for your Page, upload an sRGB JPG file that's 851 pixels wide, 315 pixels tall and less than 100 kilobytes. For images with your logo or text, you may get a higher quality result by using a PNG file.

= Logo Contest Draft =
== Requirements ==
=== Graphical Requirements ===
* Source in SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) or EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) format.
* The image should convey the ideas behind Whonix: secrecy, privacy, anonymity, mystery, simplicity (Whonix is ready-to-use).
* A logo with an approximate 1:1 ratio. <font size=-3>([https://www.whonix.org/w/images/b/be/500.png old logo].)</font> Size: 500x500 or 1000x1000.
* An optional landscape graphical creation including the logo. <font size=-3>([https://www.whonix.org/w/images/e/e0/210-Banner.png old banner])</font> Size: xxx X xxx
* The logo has to be a bit serious, but not sad.
* The "Whonix" name must be spelled with an uppercase "W" only, and lowercase "honix".
* The image should be suited to print on nice stickers that people want to have on their computers, and on t-shirts that people are happy to wear.

=== Legal Requirements ===
* We cannot reuse the Tor, Debian or other logos for trademark/legal reasons.
* Free licence, compatible with GPL3+. (Very easy. Your least worries. If there is a will to donate your work, we'll help with licensing stuff.)
* Make sure that the fonts that you use are compatible with GPL3+. To be on the safe side, use [http://pkg-fonts.alioth.debian.org/review/debian-font-review.html fonts available in Debian main], otherwise we will ask you to prove their compatibility with GPL3+.

== Complementary materials ==
As the logo will be used in quite different places, we encourage you to submit complementary materials. These are not strict requirements but will help us evaluate your proposal better. Besides, if your logo is chosen, we will need them anyway before we are able to put it to use publicly.

These complementary materials are:

* Fonts to be used to create other material matching the logo.

== Calendar ==

* Send to XXX forum thread XXX or e-mail adrelanos@riseup.net (will be posted in forum thread).

* **XXst of XXX**: Deadline for sending proposals
* **Xth of XXX**: The winner is announced.
* <s>**XXth of XXX**: All the complementary materials have to be ready so we have time to include them in Whonix 1.0. The designer of the winning logo is strongly encouraged to do this work, before or after the deadline for proposals.</s>
