== Facebook Profile Picture ==
<blockquote>
What are the dimensions of my Page's profile picture?

Page profile pictures are square and display at 160x160 pixels on your Page. The photo you upload must be at least 180x180 pixels. We recommend uploading a square image. Rectangular images will be cropped to fit a square. Your Page's profile picture will also display next to your Page's name around Facebook to represent your Page.

You can be creative with how your Page's profile picture and cover photo go together. On your Page, the profile picture is located 16 pixels from the left side of your cover photo and 176 pixels from the top of your cover photo.

== Facebook Cover Photo ==

<blockquote>
What are the dimensions for my Page's cover photo?

Cover photos are 851 pixels wide and 315 pixels tall. If you upload an image that's smaller than these dimensions, it will be stretched to this larger size. The image you upload must be at least 399 pixels wide and 150 pixels tall.

To get the fastest load times for your Page, upload an sRGB JPG file that's 851 pixels wide, 315 pixels tall and less than 100 kilobytes. For images with your logo or text, you may get a higher quality result by using a PNG file.
