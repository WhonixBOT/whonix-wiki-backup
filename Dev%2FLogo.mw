og:image This is an image associated with your media. We suggest that you use an image of at least 1200x630 pixels.

== Facebook Cover Photo ==

<blockquote>
What are the dimensions for my Page's cover photo?

Cover photos are 851 pixels wide and 315 pixels tall. If you upload an image that's smaller than these dimensions, it will be stretched to this larger size. The image you upload must be at least 399 pixels wide and 150 pixels tall.

To get the fastest load times for your Page, upload an sRGB JPG file that's 851 pixels wide, 315 pixels tall and less than 100 kilobytes. For images with your logo or text, you may get a higher quality result by using a PNG file.

= Logo Contest Draft =
== Requirements ==
* We cannot reuse the Tor or Debian logo for trademark/legal reasons.
* Free licence, compatible with GPL3+.
* Source in SVG or EPS format.
* An image with an approximate 1:1 ratio, like the [https://media.torproject.org/image/www-images/onion.jpg onion logo].
* Plus the same image along with the "Whonix" word either:
* on the side of the image.
* The "Whonix" name must be spelled with an uppercase "W" only, and lowercase "honix".
* The image should convey the ideas behind Whonix: secrecy, privacy, anonymity, mystery, simplicity (Whonix is ready-to-use).
* The logo has to be a bit serious, but not sad.
* The image should be suited to print on nice stickers that people want to have on their computers, and on t-shirts that people are happy to wear.
* Make sure that the fonts that you use are compatible with GPL3+. To be on the safe side, use [http://pkg-fonts.alioth.debian.org/review/debian-font-review.html fonts available in Debian main], otherwise we will ask you to prove their compatibility with GPL3+.

== Complementary materials ==
As the logo will be used in quite different places, we encourage you to submit complementary materials. These are not strict requirements but will help us evaluate your proposal better. Besides, if your logo is chosen, we will need them anyway before we are able to put it to use publicly.

These complementary materials are:

* A banner for the website. The current one is 986x60px, but the new one could be higher, maybe up to 150px.
* Fonts to be used to create other material matching the logo.

== Calendar ==

* Send to XXX forum thread XXX or e-mail adrelanos@riseup.net (will be posted in forum thread).

* **XXst of XXX**: Deadline for sending proposals
* **Xth of XXX**: The winner is announced.
* <s>**XXth of XXX**: All the complementary materials have to be ready so we have time to include them in Whonix 1.0. The designer of the winning logo is strongly encouraged to do this work, before or after the deadline for proposals.</s>
