Monero Wallet CLI will show:

<pre>
This is the command line monero wallet. It needs to connect to a monero
daemon to work correctly.
WARNING: Do not reuse your Monero keys on another fork, UNLESS this fork has key reuse mitigations built in. Doing so will harm your privacy.

Monero 'Oxygen Orion' (v0.17.2.3-release)
Logging to monero-wallet-cli.log
Specify wallet file name (e.g., MyWallet). If the wallet doesn't exist, it will be created.
Wallet file name (or Ctrl-C to quit): 
</pre>

Enter the name of the wallet, for example: <code>wallet1</code>

Monero Wallet CLI will ask:

<pre>
No wallet found with that name. Confirm creation of new wallet named: wallet1
  (Y/Yes/N/No):
</pre>

Type <code>Y</code> and press enter.

Monero Wallet CLI will ask:

<pre>
Generating new wallet...
Enter a new password for the wallet: 
Confirm password: 
</pre>

Enter a password or leave it empty. Arguably how useful it is when using [[Full Disk Encryption]] on the host operating system. Re-enter password to confirm.

Monero Wallet CLI will ask:

<pre>
List of available languages for your wallet's seed:
If your display freezes, exit blind with ^C, then run again with --use-english-language-names
0 : Deutsch
1 : English
2 : Español
3 : Français
4 : Italiano
5 : Nederlands
6 : Português
7 : русский язык
8 : 日本語
9 : 简体中文 (中国)
10 : Esperanto
11 : Lojban
Enter the number corresponding to the language of your choice:
</pre>

Enter <code>1</code> recommended. In the opinion of the author this is the most common language and least likely to suffer from potential restoration issues in a few decades. Optional: choose a language of your choice.

Monero Wallet CLI will show:

Your wallet has been generated!
To start synchronizing with the daemon, use the "refresh" command.
Use the "help" command to see a simplified list of available commands.
Use "help all" command to see the list of all available commands.
Use "help <command>" to see a command's documentation.
Always use the "exit" command when closing monero-wallet-cli to save 
your current session's state. Otherwise, you might need to synchronize 
your wallet again (your wallet keys are NOT at risk in any case).

The daemon is not set up to background mine.
With background mining enabled, the daemon will mine when idle and not on battery.
Enabling this supports the network you are using, and makes you eligible for receiving new monero

Backup the 25 words seed phrase as Monero Wallet CLI requested above.

Press <code>n</code> to disable mining.

Monero Wallet CLI will show:

<pre>
Background mining not enabled. Set setup-background-mining to 1 to change.
If you are new to Monero, type "welcome" for a brief overview.

= Offline Signing Considerations =
Transactions cannot be spent while being offline. All signatories's Monero Wallet CLI need to have seen the transactions they are intending to spend and run the <code>export_multisig_info</code> command to "sync" the wallets. Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/o1ervn/rpc_transfer_method_returns_no_transaction_created/

<blockquote>to do a sync with empty wallets, i.e. before the arrival of the first funding transactions, does not do anything useful, because there are no outputs yet with the need of exchanging any info :)</blockquote>

= Hardware Wallet Considerations =
Can Monero Multisig be combined with Hardware Wallets? Would that be sane? Or would it be considered that so few people are doing it that it would actually be more risky to lock oneself out form one's coins?

Asked on [https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/qlsf5u/can_monero_multisig_be_combined_with_hardware/ Can Monero Multisig be combined with Hardware Wallets?], answer by [https://www.reddit.com/user/XMR2020/ XMR2020], <code>/r/Monero</code> moderator (<u>underline</u> added):

<blockquote>It's possible, infact, Casa a bitcoin multisig self custodial service was working on an implementation in 2019.

https://medium.com/casa/a-monero-multisig-users-guide-b313cf92a2b1

They pivoted to bitcoin only and abandoned the project.

<u>Without a commercial solution, doing it safely on your own would require being an experienced monero dev.

Would not be sane. Monero multisig in general carries a high risk of foot gunning yourself for regular users.</u></blockquote>

<blockquote>Disclaimer: There was [https://github.com/monero-project/monero/issues/4793 a bug] in the M/N multisig implementation that sometimes prevents spending from M/N wallets. It was fixed after the latest release version of Monero (v0.13.0.4), so be sure to test your wallet workflow before storing significant funds with it. The process in this guide works reliably on the Monero master development branch.</blockquote>
