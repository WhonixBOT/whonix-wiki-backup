__FORCETOC__
=== Introduction ===
Microsoft Windows is non-freedom software. See also dedicated wiki page [[Avoid_nonfreedom_software|Avoid Non-Freedom Software]].

A lot contention is derived from the different word definitions of the word "security" by advocates of proprietary software versus Freedom Software. An attempt to explain the different positions can be found in chapter [[Miscellaneous_Threats_to_User_Freedom#Tyrant_Security_vs_Freedom_Security|Tyrant Security vs Freedom Security]].
