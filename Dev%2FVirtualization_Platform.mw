= Introduction =
{{project_name}} is supported on the following platforms:

* [[Qubes]]
* [[KVM]]
* [[VirtualBox]]

In an ideal world {{project name}} would support all virtualization platforms. Theoretically this could be achieved by utilizing [http://libvirt.org/ libvirt], since it is a toolkit that supports KVM, QEU, Xen, Virtuozzo, VMWare ESX, LXC, Bhyve and other virtualization platforms on the Linux, FreeBSD, Windows and macOS operating systems. In practical terms libvert is out of the question because it does not yet abstract some commands that {{project_name}} requires, see: [https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvirt-users/2012-August/msg00150.html libvirt-users: Does libvirt abstract each and any vm specific command?]. That means without patches from interested parties, libvert APIs will not expose necessary functionalities.

= Other Virtualization Platforms =
== Introduction ==
In theory, {{project name}} could run inside any virtualizer, because its build scripts are very modular and extensible. In reality, {{project name}} has no man power to test other virtualizers. As soon as contributors join the project and maintain support for other virtualizers, support for them can most likely be easily added.

== Support Plan ==
{{project_name}} would need a [[Contribute#Contributor|contributor]] to support the other virtualization platform.

Important:

* Someone who runs those [[Test]], [[Dev/Leak Tests|Leak Tests]] and tests from [[Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection]].
* Someone who otherwise looks around if everything is sane.

Ideal:

* Someone who creates, signs, uploads .ova images for the other virtualization platform (such as VMware, KVM, etc.).

== Partially Finished Attempts ==
* [[QEMU]]
* [[VMware]]
