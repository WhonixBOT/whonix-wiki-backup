= Virtualization Platform =
''Whonix Example Implementation'' is based on Virtual Box. There was a development discussion about switching to a more secure Virtualization Platform and help is required.

In an ideal world, ''Whonix Example Implementation'' would support all Virtualization Platforms. Theoretically it could be done using [http://libvirt.org/ libvirt]. Practically libvirt is out of question. [https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvirt-users/2012-August/msg00150.html libvirt-users Does libvirt abstract each and any vm specific command?] Libvirt does not (yet) abstract some commands Whonix depends on.

See also [[Advanced_Security_Guide#About_VirtualBox]].

See [[Dev/Other Virtualization Platforms]] for more.

Virtual Box no longer in Debian main:

* "Virtualbox ships a BIOS that requires Watcom to compile from real sources,
precompiled copy they ship as well is free but is not the preferred form
for modification." http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/08/msg00106.html
