= Introduction =
{{project_name}} is available for:

* [[Qubes]]
* [[KVM]]
* [[VirtualBox]]

In an ideal world, {{project name}} would support all Virtualization Platforms. Theoretically it could be done using [http://libvirt.org/ libvirt]. Practically libvirt is out of question. [https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvirt-users/2012-August/msg00150.html libvirt-users Does libvirt abstract each and any vm specific command?] Libvirt does not (yet) abstract some commands {{project name}} depends on.

= Other Virtualization Platforms =
== Introduction ==
In theory, {{project name}} could run inside any virtualizer, because its build scripts are very modular and extensible. In reality, {{project name}} has no man power to test other virtualizers. As soon as contributors join the project and maintain support for other virtualizers, support for them can most likely be easily added.

== Support Plan ==
{{project_name}} would need a [[Contribute#Contributor|contributor]] to support the other virtualization platform.

Important:

* Someone who runs those [[Test]], [[LeakTests]] and tests from [[Protocol-Leak-Protection_and_Fingerprinting-Protection]].
* Someone who otherwise looks around if everything is sane.

Ideal:

* Someone who creates, signs, uploads .ova images for the other virtualization platform (such as VMware, KVM, etc.).

== Partially Finished Attempts ==
* [[QEMU]] (deprecated)
* [[VMware]] (proof of concept, no contributor)

= VirtualBox =
Moved to [[Dev/VirtualBox]].

<pre>
time sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdc bs=64K conv=noerror,sync status=progress

qubes ticket https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/5372 plus own ticket
nobody has a solution
how to get data out of qubes dd image undocumented
how to get data out of qubes backup also undocumented questionmark

dom0 upgrade risks making the system unbootabe
backup required

qubes internal backup not reliable
past scrypt issue when restoring
so without backup verification one would not know if it would actually be a sufficient backup
takes very long time
no automated verification
hard to script since folder name is in VM
verification of backup might actually fill up disk and thereby brick system
dd based backup does not boot on same computer since it boots from internal rather than external disk
removal of internal disk by BIOS not possible and physical removal is high effort
dd based backup also does not boot on another notebook
not sure if resoring back the dd backup would boot or what is missing
