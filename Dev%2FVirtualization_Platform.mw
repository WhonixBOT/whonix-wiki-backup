= Introduction =
''Whonix Example Implementation'' is based on VirtualBox. There was a development discussion about switching to a more secure Virtualization Platform and help is required.

In an ideal world, ''Whonix Example Implementation'' would support all Virtualization Platforms. Theoretically it could be done using [http://libvirt.org/ libvirt]. Practically libvirt is out of question. [https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvirt-users/2012-August/msg00150.html libvirt-users Does libvirt abstract each and any vm specific command?] Libvirt does not (yet) abstract some commands Whonix depends on.

= Other Virtualization Platforms =
== Introduction ==
In theory, Whonix could run inside any virtualizer, because its build scripts are very modular and extensible. In reality, Whonix has no man power to test other virtualizers. As soon as contributors join the project and maintain support for other virtualizers, support for them can most likely be easily added.

* [[Qubes]]
* [[KVM]]
* [[VirtualBox]]

== Support Plan ==
Whonix would need a contributor to support the other virtualization platform.

Important:

* Someone who runs those [[Test]], [[LeakTests]] and tests from [[Protocol-Leak-Protection_and_Fingerprinting-Protection]].
* Someone who otherwise looks around if everything is sane.

Ideal:

* Someone who creates, signs, uploads .ova images for the other virtualization platform (such as VMware, KVM, etc.).

== Partially Finished Attempts ==
* [[VMware]] (proof of concept, no maintainer)

= VirtualBox =
== VirtualBox missing features ==
The following is non-ideal for [[Comparison_with_Others#Verifiable_Builds|verifiable builds]], because we have to convert to vdi first:

* [https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=58460 export VM using VDI instead of VMDK?]: seems not possible.
* [https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=58461 Mount VMDK on Debian testing/jessie?]: seems not possible.

The following is non-ideal, because we can not warn when host operating sytems are being used we don't think are the right tool for hosting Whonix VMs:

* [https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=58498 Can a guest find out its host operating system?]: seems not possible.

* VirtualBox uses VMDK version 3. This is non-ideal, because working with these images is difficult.
** Converting these images is difficult.
*** qemu-img version 1.6.1 ({{Code|qemu-img convert "vmdk_file" -O RAW "vdi_file"}}) fails with: {{Code2|qemu-img: 'image' uses a vmdk feature which is not supported by this qemu version: VMDK version 3}}, which is a [https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1253465 known issue in qemu].
*** Therefore it is required to convert them with VBoxManage to .vdi first. ({{Code|VBoxManage clonehd --format VDI "vmdk_file" "vdi_file"}})
** Therefore the Free guestmount doesn't support mounting VMDK version 3 as well (because it internally uses qemu-img).
** It requires proprietary software to mount them, such as the proprietary nbdkit plugin [https://github.com/libguestfs/nbdkit/blob/master/plugins/vddk/README.VDDK vddk]. We're not aware of a Free Software alternative yet.

== VirtualBox no longer in Debian main ==
* http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=709899
* http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/08/msg00057.html
* "Virtualbox ships a BIOS that requires Watcom to compile from real sources,precompiled copy they ship as well is free but is not the preferred form for modification." http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/08/msg00106.html
* https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/12011
* https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-September/029978.html

== Arguments for keeping VirtualBox Support ==
* [[KVM]] is not available to Windows users.
* Simplicity, as in: VirtualBox has a VM import GUI feature.
* Available to users not owning computer providing hardware virtualization. (KVM requires that. [[QEMU]] does not?)
* Due to Windows users and simplicity it leads to greater popularity, which in theory attracts more users, developers, auditors, founding, etc and is therefore good for the overall health of the project.
* Some Windows/VirtualBox users experimenting with their first Linux (Whonix) will one day become users who mainly use Linux as their host operating system.
