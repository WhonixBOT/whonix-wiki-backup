= Introduction =
''Whonix Example Implementation'' is based on VirtualBox. There was a development discussion about switching to a more secure Virtualization Platform and help is required.

In an ideal world, ''Whonix Example Implementation'' would support all Virtualization Platforms. Theoretically it could be done using [http://libvirt.org/ libvirt]. Practically libvirt is out of question. [https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvirt-users/2012-August/msg00150.html libvirt-users Does libvirt abstract each and any vm specific command?] Libvirt does not (yet) abstract some commands Whonix depends on.

This is non-ideal for reproducible builds.
