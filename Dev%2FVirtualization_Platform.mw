= Introduction =
{{project_name}} is officially supported on the following platforms:

* [[Qubes]]
* [[KVM]]
* [[VirtualBox]]

In an ideal world {{project name}} would support all virtualization platforms. Theoretically this could be achieved by utilizing [http://libvirt.org/ libvirt], since it is a toolkit that supports KVM, QEU, Xen, Virtuozzo, VMWare ESX, LXC, Bhyve and other virtualization platforms on the Linux, FreeBSD, Windows and macOS operating systems. In practical terms libvert is out of the question because it does not yet abstract some commands that {{project_name}} requires, see: [https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvirt-users/2012-August/msg00150.html libvirt-users: Does libvirt abstract each and any vm specific command?]. That means without patches from interested parties, libvert APIs will not expose necessary functionalities.

= Other Virtualization Platforms =

Theoretically {{project name}} could run inside any virtualizer because its build scripts are very modular and extensible. In reality, {{project name}} does not have sufficient developer resources to test other virtualizers. If additional contributors join the project and become maintainers for other virtualizers, then support for those can be officially added.

== Support Plan ==

As outlined above, {{project_name}} needs dedicated [[Contribute#Contributor|contributors]] to support other virtualization platforms. Essential contributor responsibilities include:

* running [[Test|new security feature tests]]
* performing [[Dev/Leak Tests|Leak Tests]] and relevant [[Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection|Protocol Leak and Fingerprinting Protectionâ€Ž]] tests
* conducting other miscellaneous security and performance tests to confirm the platform has full functionality and is fit for purpose 

Ideally, a dedicated contributor would also create, sign and upload <code>.ova</code> images for the alternative virtualization platform (such as VMware, QEMU, etc.).

== Partially Finished Attempts ==

* [[QEMU]]
* [[VMware]]
