= Introduction =
{{project_name}} is available for:

* [[Qubes]]
* [[KVM]]
* [[VirtualBox]]

In an ideal world, {{project name}} would support all Virtualization Platforms. Theoretically it could be done using [http://libvirt.org/ libvirt]. Practically libvirt is out of question. [https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvirt-users/2012-August/msg00150.html libvirt-users Does libvirt abstract each and any vm specific command?] Libvirt does not (yet) abstract some commands {{project name}} depends on.

= Other Virtualization Platforms =
== Introduction ==
In theory, {{project name}} could run inside any virtualizer, because its build scripts are very modular and extensible. In reality, {{project name}} has no man power to test other virtualizers. As soon as contributors join the project and maintain support for other virtualizers, support for them can most likely be easily added.

== Support Plan ==
{{project_name}} would need a [[Contribute#Contributor|contributor]] to support the other virtualization platform.

Important:

* Someone who runs those [[Test]], [[Leak Tests]] and tests from [[Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection]].
* Someone who otherwise looks around if everything is sane.

Ideal:

* Someone who creates, signs, uploads .ova images for the other virtualization platform (such as VMware, KVM, etc.).

== Partially Finished Attempts ==
* [[QEMU]]
* [[VMware]]
