= Introduction =
''Whonix Example Implementation'' is based on VirtualBox. There was a development discussion about switching to a more secure Virtualization Platform and help is required.

In an ideal world, ''Whonix Example Implementation'' would support all Virtualization Platforms. Theoretically it could be done using [http://libvirt.org/ libvirt]. Practically libvirt is out of question. [https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvirt-users/2012-August/msg00150.html libvirt-users Does libvirt abstract each and any vm specific command?] Libvirt does not (yet) abstract some commands Whonix depends on.

= Other Virtualization Platforms =
== Introduction ==
In theory, Whonix could run inside any virtualizer, because its build scripts are very modular and extensible. In reality, Whonix has no man power to test other virtualizers than VirtualBox. As soon as contributors join the project and maintain support for other virtualizers, support for them can most likely be easily added.

== Support Plan ==
Whonix would need a contributor to support the other virtualization platform.

Important:

* Someone who runs those [[Test]], [[LeakTests]] and tests from [[Protocol-Leak-Protection_and_Fingerprinting-Protection]].
* Someone who otherwise looks around if everything is sane.

Ideal:

* Someone who creates, signs, uploads .ova images for VMware.

== Partially Finished Attempts ==
* [[VMware]] (proof of concept)
* [http://qubes-os.org/ Qubes OS] as host operating system would be most interesting. It just needs someone sufficiently motivated to do a little work to make it reality, see blog post [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/featureblog/2013/02/running-whonix-on-top-of-qubes-os-anyone-interested-unpacking-ova-images/ Running Whonix on top of Qubes OS, anyone interested?.].
* [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/c0090dde/ Qemu / Virt-Manager] successful report in the forums

== VirtualBox missing features ==
The following is non-ideal for [[Comparison_with_Others#Verifiable_Builds|verifiable builds]], because we have to convert to vdi first:

* [https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=58460 export VM using VDI instead of VMDK?]: seems not possible.
* [https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=58461 Mount VMDK on Debian testing/jessie?]: seems not possible.

The following is non-ideal, because we can not warn when host operating sytems are being used we don't think are the right tool for hosting Whonix VMs:

* [https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=58498 Can a guest find out its host operating system?]: seems not possible.
