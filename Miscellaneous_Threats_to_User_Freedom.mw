= User Freedom Threats =

Since the inception of the four original essential software freedoms provided by [https://forums.whonix.org/t/lets-call-it-freedom-software-rather-than-free-software-or-open-source/6961 Freedom Software], other issues have emerged such as:

* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tivoization tivoization] <ref><blockquote>Tivoization is the creation of a system that incorporates software under the terms of a copyleft software license (like the GPL), but uses hardware restrictions or digital rights management to prevent users from running modified versions of the software on that hardware. Richard Stallman coined the term in reference to TiVo's use of GNU GPL licensed software on the TiVo brand digital video recorders (DVR), which actively blocks users from running modified software on its hardware by design.</blockquote></ref>
* malicious features (examples: [https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-apple.html macOS] and [https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-microsoft.html Windows])
* [https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Free_Software_Directory:Antifeatures antifeatures] <ref><blockquote>Antifeatures are flags applied to applications to warn of issues that may be undesirable from the user's perspective. Frequently it is behavior that benefits the developer, but that the end user of the software would prefer not to be there.</blockquote></ref>
* [https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary-tyrants.html tyrant software]
* [https://www.fsf.org/campaigns/drm.html treacherous computing] a.k.a. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management digital restrictions management (DRM)] <ref><blockquote>Digital rights management (DRM) tools or technological protection measures (TPM) are a set of access control technologies for restricting the use of proprietary hardware and copyrighted works. DRM technologies try to control the use, modification, and distribution of copyrighted works (such as software and multimedia content), as well as systems within devices that enforce these policies.</blockquote></ref>
* compilation toolchain issues ([[Dev/VirtualBox#VirtualBox_Unavailable_in_Debian_stable_and_backports_due_to_Debian_Stable_Security_Maintenance_Issues|example]])
* non-root enforcement
* Freedom Software clients requiring the use of non-freedom servers
* centralization being encouraged instead of federation and decentralization (such as Signal)
* insistence upon the provision of a mobile number for sign-up

The {{Project name}} project does not currently have a policy prohibiting discussion of any applications with these traits.
