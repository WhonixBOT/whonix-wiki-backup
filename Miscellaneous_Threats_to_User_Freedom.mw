}}

Since the inception of the 4 original essential software freedoms provided by [https://forums.whonix.org/t/lets-call-it-freedom-software-rather-than-free-software-or-open-source/6961 Freedom Software], other issues came up such as:

* tivoization
* malicious feature
* antifeature
* tyrant software
* treacherous computing or
* DRM (digital restrictions management)
* compilation toolchain issues ([[Dev/VirtualBox#VirtualBox_Unavailable_in_Debian_stable_and_backports_due_to_Debian_Stable_Security_Maintenance_Issues|example]])
* non-root enforcement
* Freedom Software clients requiring to use non-freedom servers.
* Encouraging centralization instead of federation and decentralization (such as Signal).
* Insistence on providing a mobile number for sign-up.

The {{Project name}} project has currently no policy to prohibit discussion of any applications with such traits.
