|description=Instructions for building Whonix from Source Code inside a Virtual Machine.
}}

= Documentation =
This is a short set of instructions for building the stable version of Whonix {{Version8}} inside VirtualBox (as opposed to the traditional process of running these commands on a system that is installed directly on the hardware).

Advantages of this approach are that you can build Whonix on any OS that can run VirtualBox (you need Debian Stable for hardware type build) and that any potential system damage is limited to the VM. <s>Using snapshots you can quickly revert a faulty state or a failed build and start again.</s>

The focus here is to show the simplest way to build Whonix from source. Various security precautions such as GPG key verification are omitted.

Please read the full [[Dev/BuildDocumentation_8#Build_Documentation.|documentation]] in order to understand the process better.

== Get and prepare Debian and VirtualBox ==
[[Debian#Download_and_Verification|Download and verify]] Debian Stable/Wheezy 32 bit network install (netinst) ISO.

[https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads Download] the latest version of VirtualBox and verify the downloaded packages by [http://dlc.sun.com.edgesuite.net/virtualbox/4.3.8/SHA256SUMS comparing SHA256 checksums].

After you install VirtualBox create a new virtual machine with the following specifics:

<pre>
Name: Debian
Type: Linux
Version: Debian
Memory size: (go with recommended memory size) / Next
Hard Drive: Create a virtual hard drive now / Create
Hard drive file type: VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image) / Next
Storage on physical hard drive: Dynamically allocated / Next
File location and size: 50 GB / Create
</pre>

Start the newly created virtual machine, select the ISO of Debian {{Version8Debian}} stable (debian-7.4.0-i386-netinst.iso) and click Start.

== VM Creation ==

It is recommended that you create a log of the build process by redirecting all the output to a log file. Be aware that by doing so no build progress will appear on the screen - instead a text log file will be created in your home folder. 


Build a Whonix-Gateway virtual machine image.

<pre>
sudo ./whonix_build --build --tor-gateway >> ~/log-gateway 2>&1
</pre>


Build a Whonix-Workstation virtual machine image.

<pre>
sudo ./whonix_build --build --tor-workstation >> ~/log-workstation 2>&1
</pre>

The resulting {{Code2|.ova}} images can be found in {{Code|~/whonix_binary}} folder.


If don't want to create a log of the build process (the build progress will then appear on screen) use the following commands. 


'''This is not recommended because if anything goes wrong during the build, it will be harder to pinpoint the exact error without the actual log file.'''


For Workstation

<pre>
sudo ./whonix_build --build --tor-workstation 
</pre>

For Gateway

<pre>
sudo ./whonix_build --build --tor-gateway
</pre>

[[File:18b.png|400px]]
</div>
</div>

== VM image export == 

After a few hours (depending on your disk speed, CPU clock rate, available download bandwidth, ...) the image (either Workstation or Gateway) will be created in {{Code|~/whonix_binary}} directory. This will take from 3 to 7 hours per image.

You need to export the OVA image and then [[Install  |use it in VirtualBox]].

To transfer the images you can use VirtualBox's Shared Folders Functionality or USB transfer.  

==== Export to a shared folder ====   

To use shared folder functionality you must have [[VirtualBox_Guest_Additions|Guest Additions]] installed.

Before installing Guest Additions read the [https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html official manual page] and Whonix's [[VirtualBox_Guest_Additions|wiki page]].

If you still want to use it, [http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.3.6/ download the ISO] (VBoxGuestAdditions_4.3.6.iso) and set up folder as described in the manual.

==== Export via USB ====

Unless you install VirtualBox Extension Pack, USB 2.0 won't be supported. USB 1.1 transfer speed is very low, usually 0,5 - 1 MB/s.

===== Extension pack install (optional) =====
Before installing the extension pack read the [https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html#intro-installing official manual page].

To proceed, [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads download] the vbox file (Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-4.3.6-91406.vbox-extpack). Import the file in VirtualBox (File/Preferences/Extensions then locate the file). After installing, "Oracle VM VirtualBOx Extension Pack" entry will appear as "Active", resulting in a green arrow icon in front of the name.

===== USB transfer=====
Make your USB key available to the VM through selecting it in the Devices/USB devices menu. Plug it in first of course ;)

You can automount your USB or set it up manually. The former involves typing up a long command but on some computers usbmount might, for some reason, only reach speeds of USB 1.0, meaning it will take five to six hours to transfer the file. Test it out.

====== Using usbmount ====== 
<pre>
## Install usbmount that will automatically mount your USB to media/usb0
sudo apt-get install usbmount

## Check if the USB is present and mounted
cd /media/usb0

## Copy the OVA file to USB. 
sudo cp /home/user/whonix_binary/Whonix-Workstation-8.ova /media/usb0

## or if you have been building the Gateway
sudo cp /home/user/whonix_binary/Whonix-Gateway-8.ova /media/usb0

## Unmount the USB
sudo umount /media/usb0
</pre>

Deselect your USB key in the VM's Devices/USB devices menu to make it available to your host system again.

====== Mounting USB manually ====== 
<pre>
## Create a mount point
sudo mkdir /media/usb

## Mount your USB key to /media/usb
sudo mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 /media/usb -o uid=1000,gid=1000,utf8,dmask=027,fmask=137

## Check if the USB is present and mounted
cd /media/usb

## Copy the OVA file to USB. 
sudo cp /home/user/whonix_binary/Whonix-Workstation-8.ova /media/usb

## or if you have been building the Gateway
sudo cp /home/user/whonix_binary/Whonix-Gateway-8.ova /media/usb

## Unmount the USB
sudo umount /media/usb
</pre>

== Finishing up == 

You are done! OVA file is now on your USB key/in your shared folder. All you have to do is [[Install  |use it in VirtualBox]].

If you want to build another image (presuming you have build only Workstation or Gateway this time) revert the VM state to [[Jekyll:Sandbox#Building_from_source|Snapshot 2]].

From there follow the steps as you previously did and build the image you still need Workstation or Gateway.
