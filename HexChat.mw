== Introduction ==

XChat<ref>http://xchat.org/</ref> in Whonix has been hardened according to TorifyHOWTO/XChat<ref>https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/XChat</ref>. All servers, besides the secure (SSL) version of OFTC have been removed. You are encouraged to add the secure version of your IRC server. (Preferably a hidden service, SSL as a fallback or at best, both.) See also [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/XChat TorifyHOWTO/XChat].

On OFTC is the official #Tor. Note that no Whonix developers hang out there! Upstream Tor developers do not support Whonix. For contacting Whonix developers, see [[Contact | Contacting Whonix developers / Feedback / Questions]].

== How to start XChat ==

Start menu -> Applications -> Internet -> XChat IRC

== Reset your XChat idenity ==

If you want to reset your XChat identity.
WARNING: this will kill XChat, delete all your settings, scripts and logs and creates a fresh XChat identity.
Run.

{{Open a Whonix-Workstation Terminal}}

<pre>
xchat-reset
</pre>

== SASL ==
Some networks, some hidden IRC servers, such as freenode, require SASL to connect to them.

Setting up SASL is outside the scope of this document, have a look into [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/XChat TorifyHOWTO/XChat].

All XChat plugins have been deactivated (hardening) and deactivated using dpkg-divert. To re-enable them, use one of the following commands depending on which plugin you need.

<pre>
sudo dpkg-divert --rename --remove /usr/lib/xchat/plugins/python.so
sudo dpkg-divert --rename --remove /usr/lib/xchat/plugins/tcl.so
sudo dpkg-divert --rename --remove /usr/lib/xchat/plugins/perl.so
</pre>

Those commands are reverted when Whonix Debian Packages get updated. TODO: How to prevent that.

The Ident Protocol<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ident</ref> is automatically blocked because Whonix-Workstation is firewalled.

The [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/IrcSilc TorifyHOWTO/IrcSilc] contains general IRC safety techniques and other tips.
