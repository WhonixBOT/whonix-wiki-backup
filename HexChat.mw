== Introduction ==
https://www.whonix.org/w/images/7/7b/Hexchaticon.png

HexChat <ref>http://hexchat.org/</ref> is an open source IRC client based on [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XChat XChat]. It includes basic functionality found in IRC clients, like secure connections, multiple server connections, nick completion, a client-to-client protocol, direct client-to-client file transfer and chat, and a plugin system which allows extension of features and further customization. <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XChat</ref> <ref>https://hexchat.github.io/</ref>

HexChat in Whonix has been hardened according to The Tor Project's Torrifying HexChat guide. <ref>https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/HexChat</ref> All servers, besides the secure (SSL) version of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_and_Free_Technology_Community Open and Free Technology Community (OFTC)] have been removed. <ref>This is an IRC network which provides collaboration services for members of the free software community, anywhere in the world.</ref> It is recommended to add the securely encrypted version of the IRC server, preferably an onion service which uses SSL as a fallback or at best, both. Also see: [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/HexChat Torifying HexChat].

Note that the official #Tor channel is on OFTC, but no Whonix developers are active there! Upstream Tor developers do not support Whonix. For help with Whonix-related issues, see [[Support|Support]].

== How to start HexChat ==
{{Box|text=
<u>If you are using [[Qubes|Qubes-Whonix]]</u>, complete the following steps.

<code>Qubes App Launcher (blue/grey "Q")</code> -> <code>Whonix-Workstation AppVM (commonly named anon-whonix)</code> -> <code>HexChat IRC</code>

<u>If you are using a graphical Whonix-Workstation</u>, complete the following steps.

<code>Start menu</code> -> <code>Applications</code> -> <code>Internet</code> -> <code>HexChat IRC</code>
}}

== Reset your HexChat identity ==
{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text       = 
'''Warning:''' This will kill HexChat, delete all your settings, scripts and logs and creates a fresh HexChat identity.
}}


{{Open a Whonix-Workstation Terminal}}

Run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
hexchat-reset
}}

Done.

== SASL ==
Some networks, some hidden IRC servers, such as freenode, require SASL to connect to them.

Setting up SASL is outside the scope of this document, have a look into [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/XChat TorifyHOWTO/XChat].

= Privacy Check =
Before you join any channels, whois yourself from the status window.

{{CodeSelect|code=
/whois your-user-name your-user-name
}}

See the following screenshot. Chat (IRC Client), showing /whois of oneself.

(here for e.g i used:- /whois TNTBOMBOM TNTBOMBOM)

= IRC General =

The Ident Protocol <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ident</ref> is automatically blocked because Whonix-Workstation is firewalled. <ref>The Tor Project [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/IRC notes]: ''"In both UNIX and Windows systems, the logged in username becomes the default ident. The ident is seen by most clients during channel join and when performing the /â€‹whois command. It is therefore recommended to fake your ident before you connect to any IRC servers."''</ref>

The Tor Project [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/IRC Internet Relay Chat] page contains general IRC safety techniques and other tips. Another useful resource is the [http://www.irchelp.org/security/ IRC Security] page. Key information and advice is provided on:

* The importance of (additional) encrypted connections:
** If an onion service is available, then use it. It is also safer to combine additional layers of encryption like SSL, TLS or GPG if possible.
** If an IRC server uses a self-signed certificate, then explicitly check the SSL/TLS certificate is correct to prevent [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack man-in-the-middle attacks].
* Avoiding [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_%28computing%29 Trojan Horse attacks] via malicious, downloaded files.
* Defense against Denial of Service attacks. <ref>Which otherwise can make networked computers disconnect or crash.</ref>
* Dangers associated with downloaded files.
* Firewall considerations.
* The impact of potential back-doors in IRC clients.
* Circumvention of Tor censorship.
* End-to-end encryption using OTR and other plugins.
* Social safety measures to prevent de-anonymization.
* Other miscellaneous security advice.

= Connection Issues =
If you see messages such as the following.

<pre>
* Closing Link: 93.115.95.205 (No more connections permitted from your host)
* Disconnected (Remote host closed socket)
</pre>

This most likely means, the connection the the IRC server is working, however the IRC server disconnects you because they are not accepting connections from the [[Tor]] network. This is not a Whonix specific issue. All users of Tor have to deal with these issues. This is a [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/doc/ListOfServicesBlockingTor common issue].

There is no great solution to this. Just various options that have pros and cons.

* Use an alternative to IRC if applicable, see also [[Chat]] for alternatives.
* Use another, Tor friendly IRC network, if possible. See this [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/BlockingIrc list of Tor blocking and Tor "half-friendly" IRC networks]. Possible search query for search engines could be "Tor friendly IRC server".
* See if that IRC network provides a solution for Tor users. For example [https://freenode.net/news/connecting-to-freenode-using-tor-sasl freenode provides a solution for Tor users].
* Combine Tor with a tunnel for circumvention. (Which would be a rather time consuming learning curve just to solve this issue.) Connecting to Tor before a tunnel-link (proxy/VPN/SSH) (User -> Tor -> proxy/VPN/SSH -> Internet). Start reading here at [[Tunnels/Introduction]].
* Use an IRC bouncer. (Which is briefly mentioned on [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/IrcSilc TorifyHOWTO/IrcSilc].) However, there are probably no trustworthy free IRC bouncers. While IRC bouncers are very affordable, it is difficult sign up and pay anonymously. See also [[Money]].
