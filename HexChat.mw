ChatRoll is an [http://chatroll.org/ Free online Chatting] Video website that pairs strangers from around the world together for webcam-based conversations. Visitors to the website begin an online chat (text, audio, and video) with another visitor who is chosen at random. At any point, either user may leave the current chat by initiating another random connection. 

[http://chatroll.org/ ChaTroll] offers a random chat system, which allows you to meet new people with video chat for free. The online video chat system will pair you at random with another person using the free chat video . If you don't like the people you meet, you can click on the "Next" button to match somebody new.

== How to start XChat ==

Start menu -> Applications -> Internet -> XChat IRC

== Reset your XChat idenity ==

If you want to reset your XChat identity.
WARNING: this will kill XChat, delete all your settings, scripts and logs and creates a fresh XChat identity.
Run.

<pre>xchat-reset</pre>

== SASL ==
Some networks, some hidden IRC servers, such as freenode, require SASL to connect to them.

Setting up SASL is outside the scope of this document, have a look into [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/XChat TorifyHOWTO/XChat].

All XChat plugins have been deactivated (hardening) and deactivated using dpkg-divert. To re-enable them, use one of the following commands depending on which plugin you need.

<pre>
sudo dpkg-divert --rename --remove /usr/lib/xchat/plugins/python.so
sudo dpkg-divert --rename --remove /usr/lib/xchat/plugins/tcl.so
sudo dpkg-divert --rename --remove /usr/lib/xchat/plugins/perl.so
</pre>

Those commands are reverted when Whonix Debian Packages get updated. TODO: How to prevent that.
