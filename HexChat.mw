== Introduction ==
https://www.whonix.org/w/images/7/7b/Hexchaticon.png

HexChat<ref>http://hexchat.org/</ref> (previously called XChat) in Whonix has been hardened according to TorifyHOWTO/XChat<ref>https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/XChat</ref>. All servers, besides the secure (SSL) version of OFTC have been removed. You are encouraged to add the secure version of your IRC server. (Preferably an onion service, SSL as a fallback or at best, both.) See also [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/XChat TorifyHOWTO/XChat].

On OFTC is the official #Tor. Note that no Whonix developers hang out there! Upstream Tor developers do not support Whonix. For getting help with Whonix, see [[Support|Support]].

== How to start HexChat ==
{{Box|text=
<u>If you are using [[Qubes|Qubes-Whonix]]</u>, complete the following steps.

<code>Qubes App Launcher (blue/grey "Q")</code> -> <code>Whonix-Workstation AppVM (commonly named anon-whonix)</code> -> <code>HexChat IRC</code>

<u>If you are using a graphical Whonix-Workstation</u>, complete the following steps.

<code>Start menu</code> -> <code>Applications</code> -> <code>Internet</code> -> <code>HexChat IRC</code>
}}

== Reset your HexChat identity ==
{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text       = 
'''Warning:''' This will kill HexChat, delete all your settings, scripts and logs and creates a fresh HexChat identity.
}}


{{Open a Whonix-Workstation Terminal}}

Run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
hexchat-reset
}}

Done.

== SASL ==
Some networks, some hidden IRC servers, such as freenode, require SASL to connect to them.

Setting up SASL is outside the scope of this document, have a look into [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/XChat TorifyHOWTO/XChat].

= Privacy Check =
Before you join any channels, whois yourself from the status window.

{{CodeSelect|code=
/whois your-user-name your-user-name
}}

See the following screenshot. Chat (IRC Client), showing /whois of oneself.

(here for e.g i used:- /whois TNTBOMBOM TNTBOMBOM)

= IRC General =

The Ident Protocol<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ident</ref> is automatically blocked because Whonix-Workstation is firewalled.

The [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/IrcSilc TorifyHOWTO/IrcSilc] contains general IRC safety techniques and other tips.

= Connection Issues =
If you see messages such as the following.

<pre>
* Closing Link: 93.115.95.205 (No more connections permitted from your host)
* Disconnected (Remote host closed socket)
</pre>

This most likely means, the connection the the IRC server is working, however the IRC server disconnects you because they are not accepting connections from the [[Tor]] network. This is not a Whonix specific issue. All users of Tor have to deal with these issues. This is a [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/doc/ListOfServicesBlockingTor common issue].

There is no great solution to this. Just various options that have pros and cons.

* Use an alternative to IRC if applicable, see also [[Chat]] for alternatives.
* Use another, Tor friendly IRC network, if possible. See this [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/BlockingIrc list of Tor blocking and Tor "half-friendly" IRC networks]. Possible search query for search engines could be "Tor friendly IRC server".
* See if that IRC network provides a solution for Tor users. For example [https://freenode.net/news/connecting-to-freenode-using-tor-sasl freenode provides a solution for Tor users].
* Combine Tor with a tunnel for circumvention. (Which would be a rather time consuming learning curve just to solve this issue.) Connecting to Tor before a tunnel-link (proxy/VPN/SSH) (User -> Tor -> proxy/VPN/SSH -> Internet). Start reading here at [[Tunnels/Introduction]].
* Use an IRC bouncer. (Which is briefly mentioned on [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/IrcSilc TorifyHOWTO/IrcSilc].) However, there are probably no trustworthy free IRC bouncers. While IRC bouncers are very affordable, it is difficult sign up and pay anonymously. See also [[Money]].
