= Introduction =

The Whonix-Installer for Windows was designed as a simple and fast way to set-up Whonix on a system running Microsoft Windows. Now, to make using Whonix after the installation as convenient as possible, we've created a small C# based launcher for Whonix, name Whonix-UI or more simply Whonix.exe. The following instructions will tell you how to build it using the source code provided via Github. For information on how to build the Installer, go here: [[Building the Whonix-Installer for Windows]]

= What you'll need =

* A Windows-Machine on which to do this
* Visual Studio Community 2015 or newer <u>including the ClickOnce Publishing Tools</u> (need to choose <u>custom</u> and select ClickOnce during installation), which may be obtained from here: https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/
* The Whonix-UI source code, which can be found here: https://github.com/EgoBits1/Whonix-Windows-UI

= Building Whonix-UI =

Start Visual Studio Community and click on "Open Project...". Select "Whonix-UI.sln" found in the highest level folder of the source you've obtained from Github. Now, click on "Build -> Build Solution". You should now find the finished Whonix.exe under "Whonix-UI\bin\Debug".
