}}

= Introduction =

The {{project_name}}-Windows-Installer for Windows was designed as a simple and fast way to set-up {{project name}} on a system running Microsoft Windows. Now, to make using {{project name}} after the installation as convenient as possible, we've created a small C# based launcher for {{project_name}}, name {{project_name}}-Windows-UI or more simply <code>{{project_name_short}}.exe</code>. The following instructions will tell you how to build it using the source code provided via Github. For information on how to build the Installer, go here: [[Dev/Building the {{project_name_short}}-Installer for Windows|Building the {{project_name}}-Installer for Windows]]

= What you'll need =

* A Windows-Machine on which to do this
* Visual Studio Community 2015 or newer <u>including the ClickOnce Publishing Tools</u> (need to choose <u>custom</u> and select ClickOnce during installation), which may be obtained from here: https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/
* The {{project_name}}-Windows-UI source code, which can be found here: https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/{{project_name_short}}-Windows-UI

= Building {{project_name}}-Windows-UI =

Start Visual Studio Community and click on "Open Project...". Select <code>{{project_name_short}}-UI.sln</code> found in the highest level folder of the source you've obtained from Github. Now, click on "Build -> Build Solution". You should now find the finished <code>{{project_name_short}}.exe</code> under <code>{{project_name_short}}-UI\bin\Debug</code>.
