General notes about Firejail settings:

* The master firejail.profile contains global settings.

*  New profiles or tweaked ones that override the default ones go under ~/.config/firejail. The default ones exist under /etc/firejail

* Arch guide: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Firejail#Using_Firejail_by_Default
specifies the ways to set programs to automatically start contained.

* Xpra is not a hard-coded dependency out of consideration for headless systems. TODO: Decide which anon-shared package to add it to.
