General notes about Firejail settings:

* The master firejail.profile contains global settings.

*  New profiles or tweaked ones that override the default ones go under ~/.config/firejail (path configurable if needed). The default ones exist under /etc/firejail

* Arch guide: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Firejail#Using_Firejail_by_Default
specifies the ways to set programs to automatically start contained.

* Xpra is not a hard-coded dependency out of consideration for headless systems. TODO: Decide which anon-shared package to add it to.

* Creating symlinks to start programs automatically under firejail is as simple as running <code>sudo firecfg</code>. This creates covers all software on the system that has a firejail profile.<ref>https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=822693</ref> To list all symlinks: <code>firecfg --list</code> and to reverse this action: <code>firecfg --clean</code>
