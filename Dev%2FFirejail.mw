General notes about Firejail settings:

* The master firejail.profile contains global settings.

*  New profiles or tweaked ones that override the default ones go under ~/.config/firejail (path configurable if needed). The default ones exist under /etc/firejail

* Arch guide: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Firejail#Using_Firejail_by_Default
specifies the ways to set programs to automatically start contained.

* Xpra is not a hard-coded dependency out of consideration for headless systems. TODO: Decide which anon-shared package to add it to.

* Creating symlinks to start programs automatically under firejail is as simple as running <code>sudo firecfg</code>. This covers all software on the system that has a firejail profile.<ref>https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=822693</ref> To list all symlinks: <code>firecfg --list</code> and to reverse this action: <code>firecfg --clean</code>

* To integrate with Firejail, the [https://git.schwanenlied.me/yawning/tor-firejail/src/master/start-tor-browser script] developed by Yawning is meant to replace the one in this path: /home/user/.tb/tor-browser/Browser/start-tor-browser
While the profile can reside under ~/.config/firejail<ref>https://git.schwanenlied.me/yawning/tor-firejail</ref><ref>https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2016-May/010947.html</ref>
