= Introduction =

<code>swap-file-creator</code> adds an encrypted swap file to the system. On every boot, it creates a new encrypted swapfile with a random password.

This is useful for systems with low RAM such as those inside virtual machines. It has an ENOUGH_RAM setting which defaults to 1950 MB. If there is more than enough RAM, no swap file will be created.

An option also exists to shred the swapfile on shutdown. For further information, see: https://github.com/Whonix/swap-file-creator
