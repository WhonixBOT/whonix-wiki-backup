= skip files =
== What's the supposed functionality of a done file? ==
Reliably indicate that the related whonix-setup-wizard page (such as connection_page) _really_ succeeded once.

(Therefore the qubes-whonix package deleting such a file would be considered a bug.)

== What's the supposed functionality of a skip file? ==
To be created by a derivative or advanced user.

Reliably _never_ show a certain page? [when run in "kdesudo whonix-setup-wizard setup" mode]

What, if a user was explicitly running "kdesudo whonix-setup-wizard connection_page" while the connection_page.skip file existed, don't show the connection_page then, do nothing? Or show it? I think the latter.

= How can whonix-setup-wizard be run =
* by the user (.desktop files or by command line)
** kdesudo whonix-setup-wizard repository
** kdesudo whonix-setup-wizard setup
** kdesudo whonix-setup-wizard connection_page?
* by scripts
* by autorun? {{project name}} only? Not in {{q_project_name}}?

== {{project name}} Setup Wizard showing Torrc ==
https://www.whonix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/whonix-setup-wizard-connection-wizard-2.png

Has been criticized for being a superfluous page.

Reasons why it was added:
* a) Debugging, verbosity, "paranoia", I think.
* b) Users having connection troubles [censorship] tend to go multiple times through the wizard not really understanding what it does. Expecting more magic.
* c) Imagine there was only the first page ([https://www.whonix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/whonix-setup-wizard-connection-wizard-12.png screenshot]), users clicked next, and then nothing would happen [case censored users]?
* d) The second option's tooltip on the first whonix setup wizard page is the following:
<br />
<blockquote>
The bridges option is not available yet. You must configure Tor manually.

Less sophisticated censors prevent users from accessing the Tor network by blocking connections to known relays.

"Bridge relays" help these users access Tor by not being in the same public lists as normal relays.

Sophisticated censors can only be circumvented with private obfuscated bridges.

Because there is NOT a 100% way to hide Tor, {{project name}} does NOT recommend using Tor if you fear detection.
 
Configure {{project name}} to Use a Bridge.

You must manually find and add the bridges to /usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf.

Start Menu &rarr; Applications &rarr; Torrc
 
After you have finished, run whonixsetup again.

[...]
</blockquote>

In essence we tell users to modify torrc. Then to come back using {{project name}} Setup Wizard. Because that would do the rest. Enable Tor in torrc, restart Tor so it actually connects, followed by starting timesync and whonixcheck.

That window shows the contents of /usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf. This is mostly useful for users who modified /usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf because they changed some settings beforehand (bridges...). They can check if that file still looks sane after the edit by a program (whonix-setup-wizard).
