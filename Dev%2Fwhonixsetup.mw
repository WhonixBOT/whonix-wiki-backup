'''PROPOSAL'''

= Where to show which page - Whonix vs Qubes-Whonix =
{|   class="wikitable"
!  align="left" | page
!  align="left" | Whonix
!  align="left" | Qubes-Whonix
!  align="left" | -
|-  class="even"
|  align="left" | disclaimer_(1|2)
|  align="left" | show
|  align="left" | not show
|  align="left" | 
|-  class="even"
|  align="left" | connection_page
|  align="left" | show
|  align="left" | manual run
|  align="left" | 
|-  class="even"
|  align="left" | tor_status_page
|  align="left" | show
|  align="left" | not show (?)
|  align="left" | 
|-  class="even"
|  align="left" | whonix_repo_page, repository_wizard_page_(1|2|finish)
|  align="left" | show
|  align="left" | manual run
|  align="left" | 
|-  class="even"
|  align="left" | finish_page
|  align="left" | show
|  align="left" | ?
|  align="left" | 
|-  class="even"
|  align="left" | first_use_notice
|  align="left" | show
|  align="left" | not show (?)
|  align="left" | 
|}

= skip files =
== What's the supposed functionality of a done file? ==
Reliably indicate that the related whonix-setup-wizard page (such as connection_page) _really_ succeeded once. 

Therefore touching/creating/faking a done file is a bug.

== What's the supposed functionality of a skip file? ==
Reliably _never_ show a certain page?

To be created by a derivative or advanced user.

Even though if user was running "kdesudo whonix-setup-wizard connection_page" while the connection_page.skip file existed, don't show the connection_page, do nothing?

= How can whonix-setup-wizard be run =
* by the user (.desktop files or by command line)
** kdesudo whonix-setup-wizard repository
** kdesudo whonix-setup-wizard setup
** kdesudo whonix-setup-wizard connection_page?
* by scripts
* by autorun? Whonix only? Not in Qubes-Whonix?

= overloading 'whonix-setup-wizard setup' issue =
I think the problem is we're overloading the 'whonix-setup-wizard setup' command with logic to start (not)
* show disclaimer,
* connection wizard,
* repository,
* first use notice

= TODO =

* implement 'whonix-setup-wizard connection_page'?
