= Whonix does not start? =

== Błąd PAE ==

If Whonix does not start because PAE is missing:
Virtual Box -> Right Click on Whonix-Gateway -> Settings -> Processor -> Disable the ''Enable PAE/NX'' Box -> OK.

Repeat that for Whonix-Workstation as well.

Read the [[#Boot Options|Boot Options]] chapter and use the 486 kernel.

== VERR_SSM_FIELD_NOT_CONSECUTIVE == 
If you see "{{Code2|Failed to load unit 'PATM' (VERR_SSM_FIELD_NOT_CONSECUTIVE).}}", please enable VT-x in BIOS.

== Kernel Panic ==
This probably similar to PAE crash and VERR_SSM_FIELD_NOT_CONSECUTIVE issues above. If you can, enable VT-x in BIOS. If you cannot, then disable PAE/NX in VirtualBox (see PAE crash above for instructions on how to do so) and then read the [[#Boot Options|Boot Options]] chapter and use the 486 kernel.

== VT-x is disabled in the BIOS. ==
If you see this error message.

<pre>Failed to open a session for the virtual machine Whonix-Gateway.

VT-x is disabled in the BIOS.
(VERR_VMX_MSR_VMXON_DISABLED).
</pre>

Then please enable VT-x in BIOS.

== Other reasons ==
Please have a look at the [[Download]] page. It contains instructions on how to properly download and verify the Whonix virtual machine images. There is also help available in form of screenshot or video instructions.

If you still need help, please go to the [https://www.whonix.org/forum Whonix User Help Forum].

TEST

In the grub boot menu you can choose for two seconds. Two kernels are installed by default.

* The default 686-pae kernel.
* A 486 kernel for compatibility.

'''If Whonix works out of the box, you do not need to change anything''' and you can stick to the default 686-pae kernel.

In case you need to [[#PAE_crash|disable PAE]], use the 486 kernel.
