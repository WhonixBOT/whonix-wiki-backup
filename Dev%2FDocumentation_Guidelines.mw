Authors are encouraged to use a formatting and grammatical style that is consistent with existing wiki entries and templates. Please refer to the suggestions below when completing entries.

<b>Wiki Formatting Style</b>

Preferred:
* Use preexisting wiki templates (where possible).
* If editing templates, check edits suitably match existing wiki entries with the <i>/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:NAME</i> command.
* Reference all sources and quotes.
* Do not submit copyrighted work without the necessary permission or attribution.
* Use <i>sudo</i> rather than <i>root</i> instructions.
* Standardize file path references in italics.
* Conservatively use bold text for warnings or other critical information.
* Use mediawiki chapter / sub-chapter headings (where appropriate) for long instructions or to break up large blocks of text.
* Use bold text for titling where it is otherwise required.
* Number steps for long wiki entries (where appropriate).
* Do not use colons in the last sentence preceding actual user steps; use a full stop / period. For example: "Complete the following steps." not "Complete the following steps:".
* Use <i>CodeSelect</i> for copy and paste instructions e.g. command line functions.
* Use <i>blockquote</i> for quoting text verbatim.
* Use <i>code</i> for highlighting special instructions e.g. navigating browser menus, application settings etc.
* Use <i>pre</i> for other highlighted text that does not require special formatting for cut and paste purposes.
* Use <i>ref</i> for footnoting minor issues.
* Embed internal or external links for important issues for reader consideration. For example:
** Read and apply the [[Pre_Install_Advice|Pre-Installation Security Advice]].
** This should not be confused with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_Trojan hardware/circuit trojans].
* Use tables where possible for large wiki entries defining / discussing / comparing multiple variables, categories, features, options or other data.
* Use recent screenshots if it is appropriate and feasible for the wiki entry.
* Use definite, specific, concrete language and instructional steps to minimize reader confusion.
* Use specific examples (e.g. sample configuration files, system messages, commands) when writing instructional steps to minimize reader confusion.
* Write for an audience with an expected high-school graduate education. Use https://simple.wikipedia.org as a guide for the intended audience.


<b>Grammatical Considerations</b>

Preferred:
* American English e.g. spelling, phrasing.
* Spell-checked text.
* Check hyphenation use is appropriate.
* Capitalize and check the accuracy of acronyms.
* Do not use acronyms without first defining them.
* Use double quotation marks (not single) in general.
* Avoid apostrophes or contractions in general e.g. use "It is" rather than "It's".
* Avoid use of pronouns e.g. I, you, your, me, us, we, he, she, they, mine, ours etc. Use "the" instead.
* Capitalize the first letter of words in chapter headings and titles (in general).
* Capitalize the first letter of the first word in bullet points that form complete sentences.
* End bullet points with a full stop / period (in general).
* Capitalize the first letter of words following colons, except for sentences forming lists or expounding on an idea in the first portion of the sentence e.g. "Warning: Do not use the Whonix-Gateway for user activities!" and "Multiple risks are faced by the user: deanonymization, browser fingerprinting and infection of the Whonix-Workstation.".
* Capitalize proper nouns.
* Avoid overuse of brackets and parentheses. Either write the text in a full sentence or footnote minor points.
* Write in the active voice.
* Avoid slang or common English terms.
* Avoid shortening words and use the full spelling e.g. distributions vs distros.
* Make sure all referents are clear e.g. "This theory", "That checked option", "Those settings" etc.
* Avoid long sentences. Break ideas into simpler, shorter sentences for clarity.
* Write statements in the positive, rather than negative form e.g. "What is happening", not "What is not happening".
* Nouns and verbs are preferable to adjectives and adverbs.
* Avoid the use of qualifiers e.g. pretty, very, rather, little etc.
* Omit needless words to improve sentence clarity.
