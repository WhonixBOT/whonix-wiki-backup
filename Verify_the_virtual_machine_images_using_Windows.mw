= Introduction =
{{always verify signatures reminder}}

[https://gnupg.org/ GnuPG] is a complete and free implementation of [[OpenPGP]] that allows users to encrypt and sign data and communications. [http://www.gpg4win.org/ Gpg4win] is a graphical front end for GnuPG that is used for file and email encryption in Windows. The verification process for the Whonix images begins with securely downloading and verifying the <code>gpg4win</code> package. Once completed GPG can be used from the command-line to verify the {{project_name}} images.

The following guide provides steps to: 
# Import the Intevation CA certificate.
# Install SignTool.
# Download and verify GPG4win.
# Download the Whonix signing key.
# Verify the Whonix images.

== Download the {{project_name}} Signing Key ==

{{mbox

Since all {{project_name}} releases are signed with the same key, it is unnecessary to verify the key every time a new release is announced. Trust in the key might gradually increase over time, but cryptographic signatures must still be verified every time a new release is downloaded. 

<u>Note</u>: With the exception of step 1 all commands should be run from <code>C:\Users\<user_name\Downloads</code>
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' If not already completed, have GnuPG initialize your user data folder.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --fingerprint
}}

'''2.''' Download [[Patrick Schleizer]]'s (adrelanos') [[OpenPGP]] key. <ref>
{{CodeSelect|code=
curl --tlsv1.2 --proto =https --max-time 180 --output ~/patrick.asc https://www.whonix.org/patrick.asc
}}
</ref><br />
{{Code2|<u>'''{{#widget:Key_Patrick}}'''</u>}}

'''3.''' Store the key as <code>C:\Users\<user_name>\Downloads\patrick.asc</code>

'''4.''' Check fingerprints/owners without importing anything.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --keyid-format long --with-fingerprint patrick.asc
}}

'''5.''' Verify the output.
The output should be identical to the following.
<pre>
pub  4096R/8D66066A2EEACCDA 2014-01-16 Patrick Schleizer <adrelanos@riseup.net>
      Key fingerprint = 916B 8D99 C38E AF5E 8ADC  7A2A 8D66 066A 2EEA CCDA
sub  4096R/3B1E6942CE998547 2014-01-16 [expires: 2021-04-17]
sub  4096R/10FDAC53119B3FD6 2014-01-16 [expires: 2021-04-17]
sub  4096R/CB8D50BB77BB3C48 2014-01-16 [expires: 2021-04-17]
</pre>

'''6.''' Import the key.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --import patrick.asc
}}

The output should confirm the key was imported.

<pre>
gpg: key 8D66066A2EEACCDA: 86 signatures not checked due to missing keys
gpg: key 8D66066A2EEACCDA: public key "Patrick Schleizer <adrelanos@riseup.net>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found
</pre>
<u>Output 86 signatures.</u>

The above message <i>"86 signatures not checked due to missing keys"</i> can be safely ignored since it does not relate to the signing key itself.

<u>Output already imported.</u>

If the {{project_name}} signing key was already imported in the past'', the output should confirm the key is unchanged.
<pre>
gpg: key 2EEACCDA: "Patrick Schleizer <adrelanos@riseup.net>" not changed
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:              unchanged: 1
</pre>

<u>Output trusted keys.</u>

If the following message appears at the end of the output.
<pre>
gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found
</pre>

Analyze the other messages as usual. This extra message does not relate to the {{project_name}} signing key itself, but instead usually means the user has not created an OpenPGP key yet, which is of no importance when verifying virtual machine images.

== Verify the {{project_name}} Images ==
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' If <i>not</i> already completed, download both <code>Whonix.ova</code> images and the corresponding OpenGPG signature which will be used to verify the image. 

Both the signature and .ova image should be downloaded into the same directory. 

* Download the {{project_name}} VM image and signature from [[VirtualBox/XFCE|VirtualBox/XFCE Table]]; or
* Download the {{project_name}} VM Image and Signature from [[VirtualBox/CLI|VirtualBox/CLI Table]].

'''2.''' Start the cryptographic verification; this process can take several minutes. 

At the Windows command prompt, change to the directory with the <code>Whonix.ova</code> and corresponding signature file.

{{CodeSelect|code=
cd C:\Users\<user_name>\<directory_name>
}}

'''3.''' Verify the <code>Whonix.ova</code> image.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --verify-options show-notations --verify Whonix*.ova.asc Whonix*.ova
}}

If the Virtual Machine image is correct the output will tell you that the signature is good.

{{CodeSelect|code=

gpg: Signature notation: file@name=Whonix-Gateway-{{VersionNew}}.ova
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!

This might be followed by a warning saying:
{{Template:GnuPG-Warning}}

{{gpg_signature_timestamp}}
The first line includes the signature creation timestamp. Example.

{{GnuPG_file_names}}

To help users confirm that the file name has not been tampered with, beginning with {{project_name}} version 9.6 and above the {{Code2|file@name}} OpenPGP notation includes the file name.

'''4.''' When {{project_name}} verification is complete, continue with the [[VirtualBox/XFCE|VirtualBox]] installation.

= Troubleshooting =

== SignTool is not Recognized == 

'''Figure:''' ''SignTool not Recognized Error''

[[image:signtool_command_not_recognized.png]]

This error means the SignTool executable is not accessible through <code>cmd.exe</code>. A common cause for this error is SignTool was not installed in the user's [https://john-dugan.com/path-variable-in-windows/?PageSpeed=noscript PATH]. To fix this issue add <code>signtool.exe</code> to your system PATH. <ref> [https://www.godaddy.com/help/windows-cmd-signtool-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command-operable-program-or-batch-file-19987 https://www.godaddy.com/help/windows-cmd-signtool-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command-operable-program-or-batch-file-19987]</ref> 

<u>Note</u>: This solution is temporary and works only until the command prompt is closed. When the command prompt is restarted <code>signtool.exe</code> must be added to the system PATH again.
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Open a command prompt.

In the Windows Start menu, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
 cmd.exe
}}
    
'''2.''' Add the path to <code>signtool.exe</code> to your system PATH. 

The default installation path for <code>signtool.exe</code>:

<pre>
x86 systems:  C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\<windows_version>\bin\x86 
x64 systems:  C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\<windows_version>\bin\x64
</pre>

Run the following command to add "path\to\signtool.exe" to your system PATH. Also be sure to add the Windows version to the path. 
 
{{CodeSelect|code=  
set PATH="path to signtool.ext";%PATH%
}}

For example, the following command adds the path for an <code>x64</code> system.

{{CodeSelect|code=
set PATH="C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\<windows_version>\bin\x64";%PATH%
}}
}}

== SignTool Certificate Chain Error ==

'''Figure:''' ''Root Certificate Error''

[[image:signtool_error_root_certificate_not_trusted.png]] 

This error message occurs if the <code>/pa</code> switch is not used with SignTool. This is because the default SignTool verify <code>some_file.exe</code> command uses the Windows Driver Verification Policy. <ref> See stackoverflow for further information: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11230091/whys-my-root-certificate-not-trusted Why's My Root Certificate Not Trusted?]</ref> In order for the file to verify properly the <code>/pa</code> switch must be used so SignTool uses the Default Authentication Verification Policy.

== Encountering GPG Errors ==

When a GPG error is encountered, first try a web search for the relevant error. The [https://security.stackexchange.com security stackexchange website] can also help to resolve GPG problems. Describe the problem thoroughly, but be sure it is GPG-related and not specific to {{project_name}}.
