}}

= Windows using Gpg4win =
GnuPG, a common free software implementation of OpenPGP has versions and graphical frontends for Windows.

[http://www.gpg4win.org/ Gpg4win], for Windows. [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-August/029256.html Getting a GnuPG version for Windows in a secure way].

You will find on this websites detailed documentation on how to install and use them. 

After installing Gpg4win, download the [[{{project name short}} Signing Key]].

Using Kleopatra is really cumbersome for reasons stated below. Therefore it is recommended to rather use gpg [[#command line]].

[http://www.gpg4win.org/doc/en/gpg4win-compendium_15.html Consult the Gpg4win documentation to import it].

As long as the signing key is only listed under "other certificates" in Kleopatra, you will get "{{Code2|Not enough information to check signature validity}}". The signing key needs to be listed under "trusted certificates". To do that, you need to create your own OpenPGP key first. You could do that using ({{Code2|Kleopatra -> File -> New Certificate}}). To sign {{project name}} singing key, right click on it and click "Certify Certificate". Creating local signature suffices.

Then, download the cryptographic signature corresponding to the virtual machine image you want to verify: <br />
Download {{project_name}} Signature: [[VirtualBox#Whonix_signature|VirtualBox]] | [[KVM#Whonix_signature|KVM]]

[http://www.gpg4win.org/doc/en/gpg4win-compendium_24.html#id4 Consult the Gpg4win documentation to check the signature].

If you see "{{Code2|Not enough information to check signature validity}}" as shown below.

[[File:Kleopatra_not_enough_information_to_check_signature_validity.png|alt=Kleopatra Not enough information to check signature validity|400px]]

Then you either did not import {{project name}} signing key or you did not sign {{project name}} signing key with your own key.

If you see.

<pre>
Signature valid.
Signed on 2014-04-13 06:52 with unknown certificate
0x63979B28A6F37C43BE30AFA1CB8D50BB77BB3C48
</pre>

[[File:kleopatra_valid_unknown_certificate.png|400px]]

This is a [https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=287145 bug in kleopatra which they have not fixed since 2011].

{{gpg_signature_timestamp}}

{{GnuPG_file_names}}

{{Anchor|command line}}
For this reasons, you are probably better off using gpg command line. Instructions similar to:

* [[Verify the virtual machine images using the command line]]
* https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en (scroll down to windows)
