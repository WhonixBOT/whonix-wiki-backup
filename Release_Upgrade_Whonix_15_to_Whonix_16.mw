! scope="row"| Difficulty
| Downloading a new {{gateway_product_name}} / {{workstation_product_name}} ([[Factory Reset]]) is easier than applying the [[Release Upgrade|Release Upgrade]] instructions on this page.
|-
! scope="row"| Release Upgrade vs Re-Installation
| 
To use [[{{project name short}}|{{project name}}]] 16, users can either:

* '''A)''' Release upgrade existing {{project_name}} 15 images using the instructions on this page; <u>or</u>
* '''B)''' Factory Reset using the {{project_name}} re-install method by downloading the new release, which is much simpler than upgrading
** [[{{non q project name short}}|{{non q project name}}]] 16: [[Download|download the new release]].
** [[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]] 16: [[Qubes/Install|download the new release]].

! scope="row"| Standard Upgrades
| 
* For standard ("everyday") upgrade instructions see [[Operating System Software and Updates]]. <br />
* The instructions on this page describe how to perform a [[Release Upgrade]] from {{project_name}} 15 to {{project_name}} 16.
|-

! scope="row"| Automated Release Upgrade vs Manual Release Upgrade
|
* [[#Release Upgrade|Automated Release Upgrade]] is the newer method, does not ask questions, therefore easier to use but overwrites configuration files in folder <code>/etc</code> with Debian or {{project name}} package version, should the user have modified that file.
* Manual Release Upgrade did effectively the same, offered more control over system customization but is was [[Deprecated#Manual Release Upgrade|deprecated]]. <ref>
It is still possible. All the automated [https://gitlab.com/whonix/whonix-legacy/-/blob/master/usr/sbin/release-upgrade <code>release-upgrade</code>] script does is things which a user could perform manually as well. If a manual release upgrade is desired, the user could emulate what the <code>release-upgrade</code> script is doing. Due to the size of the instructions, duplication, manual release upgrading remains [[undocumented]].
