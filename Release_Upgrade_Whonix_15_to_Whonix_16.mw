! scope="row"| Difficulty
| 
* Downloading a new {{gateway_product_name}} / {{workstation_product_name}} ([[Factory Reset]]) is easier than applying the [[Release Upgrade|Release Upgrade]] instructions on this page.
* Debian release notes:
** [https://www.debian.org/releases/bullseye/amd64/release-notes/ch-information Chapter 5. Issues to be aware of for bullseye]

! scope="row"| Release Upgrade vs Re-Installation
| 
To use [[{{project name short}}|{{project name}}]] 16, users can either:

* '''A)''' Release upgrade existing {{project_name}} 15 images using the instructions on this page; <u>or</u>
* '''B)''' Factory Reset using the {{project_name}} re-install method by downloading the new release, which is much simpler than upgrading
** [[{{non q project name short}}|{{non q project name}}]] 16: [[Download|download the new release]].
** [[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]] 16: [[Qubes/Install|download the new release]].

! scope="row"| Standard Updates
| 
* For standard ("everyday") update instructions see [[Operating System Software and Updates]]. <br />
* The instructions on this page describe how to perform a [[Release Upgrade]] from {{project_name}} 15 to {{project_name}} 16.
|-

! scope="row"| Automated Release Upgrade vs Manual Release Upgrade
|
* [[#Release Upgrade|Automated Release Upgrade]] is the newer method that has been implemented. It does not ask for user input and is therefore easier to use. However, it overwrites configuration files in folder <code>/etc</code> with the Debian or {{project name}} package version, should the user have modified that file.
* The former Manual Release Upgrade effectively did the same, but it offered more control over system customization. It is now [[Deprecated#Manual Release Upgrade|deprecated]]. <ref>
This method is still possible. All the automated [https://gitlab.com/whonix/whonix-legacy/-/blob/master/usr/sbin/release-upgrade <code>release-upgrade</code>] script does is perform actions which the user could perform manually. If a manual release upgrade is desired, emulate what the <code>release-upgrade</code> script is doing. The manual release upgrading procedure is [[undocumented]] due to the size of the instructions and duplication involved.
