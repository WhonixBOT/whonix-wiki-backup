! scope="row"| Difficulty
| 
* Downloading a new {{gateway_product_name}} / {{workstation_product_name}} ([[Factory Reset]]) is easier than applying the [[Release Upgrade|Release Upgrade]] instructions on this page.
* Debian release notes:
** [https://www.debian.org/releases/bullseye/amd64/release-notes/ch-upgrading.en.html Chapter 4. Upgrades from Debian 10 (buster)]

! scope="row"| Release Upgrade vs Re-Installation
| 
To use [[{{project name short}}|{{project name}}]] 16, users can either:

* '''A)''' Release upgrade existing {{project_name}} 15 images using the instructions on this page; <u>OR</u>
* '''B)''' Factory Reset using the {{project_name}} re-install method by downloading the new release, which is much simpler than upgrading:
** [[Non Qubes Project|{{non q project name}}]] 16: [[Download|download the new release]].
** [[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]] 16: [[Qubes/Install|download the new release]].

! scope="row"| Standard Updates
| 
* For standard ("everyday") update instructions see [[Operating System Software and Updates]]. <br />
* The instructions on this page describe how to perform a [[Release Upgrade]] from {{project_name}} 15 to {{project_name}} 16.
|-

! scope="row"| Automated Release Upgrade vs Manual Release Upgrade
|
* [[#Release Upgrade|Automated Release Upgrade]] is the newer method that has been implemented. It does not ask for user input and is therefore easier to use.
* The former Manual Release Upgrade effectively did the same, but it offered more control over system customization. It is now [[Deprecated#Manual Release Upgrade|deprecated]]. <ref>
This method is still possible. All the automated [https://gitlab.com/whonix/whonix-legacy/-/blob/master/usr/sbin/release-upgrade <code>release-upgrade</code>] script does is perform actions which the user could perform manually. If a manual release upgrade is desired, emulate what the <code>release-upgrade</code> script is doing. The manual release upgrading procedure is [[undocumented]] due to the size of the instructions and duplication involved.

|-

! scope="row"| Configuration Files Resets
| Since this is an automated release upgrade, user modified configuration files (if any) in folder <code>/etc</code> will be reset, overwritten with the Debian or {{project name}} package version. The user is free to restore the configuration after the release upgrade.

# Backup all data - ideally have a copy of the VM(s) so it is possible to try again (if necessary). <ref>Have at least one cloned backup before proceeding; for example, <code>whonix-ws-15-backup</code> and <code>whonix-gw-15-backup</code>.</ref>
# Perform the usual [[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates#Standard_Upgrade_Steps|standard ("everyday") update instructions]].
# Consider running the optional [[#Sanity Tests|sanity tests]].

# Backup all data - ideally have a clone of the VM(s) so it is possible to try again (if necessary).
# Perform the usual [[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates#Standard_Upgrade_Steps|standard ("everyday") update instructions]].
# Consider running the optional [[#Sanity Tests|sanity tests]].
# Run [[systemcheck]].
# View <code>release-upgrade</code> command version. {{CodeSelect|code=
cat /usr/sbin/release-upgrade {{!}} grep version=
}}
# Check <code>release-upgrade</code> command version. Should be minimum <code>1.5</code>, should show <code>version="1.5"</code>.
# Consider keeping the full release upgrade log output. It will be required for [[Support]] in case there are issues.
# Perform the automated [[Release Upgrade|release upgrade]] using <code>release-upgrade</code> command. {{CodeSelect|code=
sudo release-upgrade
}}
# Done. If everything went well, at the end it will show: <blockquote>INFO: OK. (release-upgrade version: 1.5) Release upgrade success.</blockquote>
