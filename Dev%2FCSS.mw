Notes for security:<br/>
Open two browser tabs.

In tab 1, open https://www.whonix.org/wiki/MediaWiki:Common.css. Then press "edit".

In tab 2, open https://www.whonix.org/wiki/MediaWiki:Common.css as well. Make your edits in tab 2. See how they look like. And if something totally breaks, so you cannot fix it in tab 2 anymore, go back to tab 1 and just press "Save page".
