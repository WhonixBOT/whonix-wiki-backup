<b><u>Security notice:<br/>
If you mess up the CSS, you might be no longer be able to restore a working version, because the buttons are no longer visible.</u></b>

Notes for security:<br/>
Open two browsers. Or at least two different browser windows.

In browser 1, open https://www.{{project clearnet}}/wiki/MediaWiki:Common.css. Then press "edit". Ideally move this browser to a different desktop (or use a different device / computer).

In browser 2, open https://www.{{project clearnet}}/wiki/MediaWiki:Common.css as well. Make your edits in browser 2. See how they look like. And if something totally breaks, so you cannot fix it in browser 2 anymore, go back to browser 1 and just press "Save page".
