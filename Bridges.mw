= What bridges are and when to use them =
When using Tor with Whonix in its default configuration, anyone who can observe the traffic of your Internet connection (for example your Internet Service Provider and perhaps your government and law enforcement agencies) can know that you are using Tor.

This may be an issue if you are in a country where the following applies:

# '''Using Tor is blocked by censorship:''' since all connections to the Internet are forced to go through Tor, this would render Whonix useless for everything except for working offline on documents, etc.
# '''Using Tor is dangerous or considered suspicious:''' in this case starting Whonix in its default configuration might get you into serious trouble.

Tor bridges, also called Tor bridge relays, are alternative entry points to the Tor network that are not all listed publicly. Using a bridge makes it harder, but not impossible, for your Internet Service Provider to know that you are using Tor.

If you are in one of the situations described above you might want to use Tor bridges in Whonix. Please also read The Tor Project's [https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges dedicated page about bridges] to get a general idea about what bridges are. Also, learn about [https://www.torproject.org/projects/obfsproxy.html.en how obfsproxy works]. Obfsproxy is the application that Tor uses to connect bridges.

''Bridges are less reliable and tend to have lower performance than other entry points. If you live in a uncensored area, they are not necessarily more secure than entry guards.'' ''Source: [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-May/024378.html bridge vs non-bridge users anonymity].''

{{Just Connectivity}} See [[#Better Connectivity without real Censorship Circumvention]].

== If using Tor is dangerous or seems suspicious in your country ==
The Tor Project's [https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges documentation on bridges] mainly focuses on censorship circumvention (i.e. trying to get around ISP or governments from blocking Tor users). If using Tor is dangerous or considered suspicious in your country, then using bridges may be advisable to prevent you from being identified as a Tor user.

'''Note:''' ''Bridges are important tools that work in many cases but'' '''they are not an absolute protection''' ''against the technical progress that an adversary could do to identify Tor users.''

== Additional info and recommendations ==

1. When Whonix starts for the first time, it won't automatically connect to the public Tor network, which is good. Whonix Setup Wizard, which is automatically started, will guide you.

2. Only use [https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges#PluggableTransports {{Code2|obfuscated bridges}}] since they are harder to identify than other bridges.

3. The less publicly known the bridges are, the better. Unfortunately, since some bridge addresses can be obtained by anyone from the Tor website or by email, it is also possible for an adversary to get the same bridge information by the same means. The Tor Project has some protection against that, but they are far from being perfect.

So the best is if you can find a trusted friend or an organization in a different country who runs a {{Code2|private obfuscated bridge}} for you. In this case "{{Code2|private}}" means that the bridge is configured with the option {{Code2|PublishServerDescriptor 0}}. <ref>
[https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en#PublishServerDescriptor Tor manual: PublishServerDescriptor]
</ref> Without this option The Tor Project can learn about the bridge and may distribute its address to others and so it could end up in the hands of your adversary.

See also [[Hide Tor and Whonix from your ISP]]!

= Finding a bridge and choosing the right protocol =
In order to use bridges, you must know in advance the address of at least one bridge. It is preferable to have a {{Code2|private obfuscated bridge}} because the alternative ({{Code2|public obfuscated bridges}}) have a greater likelihood of being censored, simply due to the fact that {{Code2|public obfuscated bridges}} are by their very nature publicly listed. The Tor Project distributes {{Code2|public bridge}} addresses in several ways, for example from their [https://bridges.torproject.org/ website] and via email. The easiest way to find a list of public bridges is from [https://bridges.torproject.org/options The Tor Project Bridge Database]

As of August 2015, according to The Tor Project, "{{Code2|obfs3}} is currently the recommend type, but depending on where you are located another type may work better for you." [https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges.html.en#5a%29] The Tor Project provides a database of [https://bridges.torproject.org/bridges?transport=obfs3 {{Code2|public obfs3 bridges}}] A more exhaustive list of public obfuscated bridges is available at [https://bridges.torproject.org/options The Tor Project Bridge Database]. It is not recommended to use {{Code2|obfs}} and {{Code2|obfs2}} bridges, which "are now deprecated and were replaced by {{Code2|obfs3}} . . . and {{Code2|obfs4}}."[https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges.html.en#PluggableTransports]. 

As time goes on and more {{Code2|obfs4}} bridge operators go online, it may be preferable to use {{Code2|obfs4}} instead of {{Code2|obf3}}, as {{Code2|obf4}} "should be able to defend more effectively against active probing." [https://blog.torproject.org/blog/recent-and-upcoming-developments-pluggable-transports#obfs2_deprecation]

= How to use bridges in Whonix =
=== Introduction ===
How to use obfuscated, (private) and/or ordinary bridges in Whonix?

Whonix does not include a wizard that guides you through the process of setting up bridges before connecting to Tor. The graphical [[Tor_Browser#tor-launcher_vs_torbrowser-launcher|tor-launcher]] ([[Dev/tor-launcher|screenshots]]) that you might now from {{Code2|The Tor Project}}'s {{Code2|Tor Browser Bundle}} ({{Code2|TBB}}) cannot be used in Whonix yet. ([[#Using_Tor_.2F_Pluggable_Transports_from_the_Tor_Browser_Bundle|TODO]]) You must add bridges manually to {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}.

({{Code2|Private}}) Ordinary, {{Code2|obfs2}}, {{Code2|obfs3}} and {{Code2|obfs4}} bridges can currently be configured on Whonix-Gateway the same way they would be configured when not using Whonix, i.e. as if you were using Debian, because [[About#Based_on_Debian|Whonix is based on Debian]]. This is done by editing {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}} within the Whonix-Gateway.

=== Step 1: access {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}} to add bridges ===
{{Open_/etc/tor/torrc}}

=== Step 2: edit {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}} (for all Whonix platforms) ===
Once inside {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}, scoll all the way to the bottom, and copy-paste the following text:
{{CodeSelect|code=
UseBridges 1
ClientTransportPlugin obfs2,obfs3 exec /usr/bin/obfsproxy managed
ClientTransportPlugin obfs4 exec /usr/bin/obfs4proxy managed
}}

Now you must add IP addresses for your bridges. For finding IP addresses, See section above, titled [[#Finding_a_bridge_and_choosing_the_right_protocol|Finding a bridge and choosing the right protocol]].

Copy-paste the IP addresses at the bottom of {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}.  Make sure to manually add the text "bridge" at the beginning of each line entry.

Example of text to add to {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}. ('''Note: do not copy-paste this list'''; these IP's will not work.) Get your own [https://bridges.torproject.org/bridges?transport=obfs3 obfs3 bridges] and [https://bridges.torproject.org/bridges?transport=obfs4 obfs4 bridges] from Tor:
{{CodeSelect|code=
bridge obfs3 109.195.132.77:22321 4352e58420e68f5e40bf7c74faddccd9d1349413
bridge obfs3 55.32.27.22:38123  4352e58420e68f5e40bf7c74faddccd9d1349413
bridge obfs3 192.24.131.513:62389 4352e58420e68f5e40bf7c74faddccd9d1349413

bridge obfs4 192.235.207.85:42086 0EEB10BF4B4FAF56D46E cert=oue8sYYw5wi4n3mf2WDOg iat-mode=0
bridge obfs4 34.218.26.20:43263 DD21A551767816A0C9495 cert=7qzS6KASquPvJU82Fm7qoJw iat-mode=0
bridge obfs4 161.217.177.95:10703 B3B8009D01BB7E5FDFAEC cert=4RaIqGiOytEXm6Hw iat-mode=0
}}

Once you have completed editing {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}, now save and exit.
<pre>
<Ctrl-X> --> press Y --> <Enter>
</pre>

=== Step 3: make changes to {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}} take effect ===
{{Reload_Tor}}

=== obfs3 ===
Example of using {{Code2|obfs3}} bridges:
You cannot use the example bridge {{Code2|141.201.27.48:420}} below, because it's only an example. You still need to find your own bridges as explained in the section above, titled [[#Finding_a_bridge_and_choosing_the_right_protocol|Finding a bridge and choosing the right protocol]].

{{CodeSelect|code=
UseBridges 1
ClientTransportPlugin obfs2,obfs3 exec /usr/bin/obfsproxy managed

}}

=== obfs4 ===
Example using {{Code2|obfs4}} bridges (Note: '''Requires Whonix 11 or higher''').

You cannot use the example bridge {{Code2|141.201.27.48:420}} below, because it's only an example. You still need to find your own bridges as explained in the section above, titled [[#Finding_a_bridge_and_choosing_the_right_protocol|Finding a bridge and choosing the right protocol]].

= Troubleshooting =
== Connection Issues ==
Perhaps you are behind a firewall that blocks outgoing connections to the ports the bridge is providing. Try using a [private] [obfuscated] bridge that uses port 80 or 443. How do you know what port the bridge is using? See the following example.

<pre>
bridge 109.195.132.77:22321
</pre>

IP would be {{Code2|109.195.132.77}}. Port would be {{Code2|22321}}.

== Better Connectivity without real Censorship Circumvention ==
Better Connectivity without "real" Censorship Circumvention

{{Just Connectivity}}

The following will limit Tor to establish only connections to the public Tor network relays that listen on ports 80 and 443.

{{Open /etc/tor/torrc}}

Add. <ref>
https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en#FascistFirewall
</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
FascistFirewall 1
}}

Save.

{{Reload Tor}}

== Missing ClientTransportPlugin line ==
When one is using

{{CodeSelect|code=
bridge obfs4 ...:... ... cert=... iat-mode=0
}}

but misses the corresponding

{{CodeSelect|code=
ClientTransportPlugin obfs4 exec /usr/bin/obfs4proxy managed
}}

line, then only a warning will be shown in the logs.

<pre>
[warn] We were supposed to connect to bridge '...:...' using pluggable transport 'obfs4', but we can't find a pluggable transport proxy supporting 'obfs4'. This can happen if you haven't provided a ClientTransportPlugin line, or if your pluggable transport proxy stopped running.
</pre>

== Missing ClientTransportPlugin executable ==
<pre>
[warn] Could not launch managed proxy executable at '/usr/bin/obfs4proxy' ('No such file or directory').
