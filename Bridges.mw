= Bridges: Description and When to Use Them =
When Tor is used with Whonix in the default configuration, anybody observing the flow of network traffic from the Internet connection can determine that Tor is being used. Potential observers include the Internet Service Provider (ISP), advanced adversaries, censorship enforcement bodies, and other interested parties.

This may be a problem for users residing in certain countries. For instance:

# '''Tor use is blocked by censorship:''' Since all Internet traffic is routed through Tor, Whonix would be rendered useless for most activities except working offline on documents, etc.
# '''Tor use is dangerous or considered suspicious:''' Starting Whonix in the default configuration might land the user in serious trouble.


Tor bridges ("Tor bridge relays") are alternative entry points to the Tor network, not all of which are listed publicly. Using a bridge makes it harder, but not impossible, for the ISP to determine a user is connecting to Tor.

Users facing one of the situations described above should consider using Tor bridges in Whonix. Prior to taking this step, please read The Tor Project's [https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges dedicated page about bridges] to get a better understanding of bridges and their operation. Users should also learn [https://www.torproject.org/projects/obfsproxy.html.en how Obfsproxy works], since it is the application that Tor uses to connect bridges.

Bridges are not bullet-proof. Here is a reminder regarding bridge versus non-bridge anonymity: <ref>https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-May/024378.html</ref>

<blockquote>Bridges are less reliable and tend to have lower performance than other entry points. If you live in a uncensored area, they are not necessarily more secure than entry guards.</blockquote>

{{Just Connectivity}} See [[#Better Connectivity without real Censorship Circumvention]].

== If Tor Use is Dangerous or Deemed Suspicious in your Location ==
The Tor Project's [https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges documentation on bridges] mainly focuses on censorship circumvention i.e. overcoming attempts by ISPs or governments to block Tor use. If Tor use is dangerous or deemed suspicious in your location, then using bridges <i>may</i> be advisable to prevent identification as a Tor user.

'''Note:''' ''Bridges are important tools that work in many cases but'' '''they are not an absolute protection''' ''against the technical progress an adversary might make in identifying Tor users.''

== Additional Information and Recommendations ==

1. When Whonix starts for the first time, it won't automatically connect to the public Tor network, which is beneficial for safety reasons. Users are guided by the Whonix Setup Wizard, which is automatically started.

2. Only use [https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges#PluggableTransports {{Code2|obfuscated bridges}}], since they are harder to identify than other bridges.

3. Less publicly known bridges are safer. Unfortunately, since some bridge addresses can be obtained by anyone from the Tor website or by email, adversaries can also get the same bridge information via the same means (and likely do). The Tor Project has some protection against adversary threats, but they are far from perfect.

For greater safety, ideally a trusted friend or organization in a different country would run a {{Code2|private obfuscated bridge}} for a user. In this case "{{Code2|private}}" means that the bridge is configured with the option {{Code2|PublishServerDescriptor 0}}. <ref>
[https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en#PublishServerDescriptor Tor manual: PublishServerDescriptor] 
</ref> Without this option set, The Tor Project can learn about the bridge and may distribute its address to others, potentially handing this information to an adversary seeking to generate a list of all known bridges.

See also [[Hide Tor and Whonix from your ISP]]!

4. Avoid using a meek provider that also runs DNS core servers, like Google's (now defunct) bridge. Google sees forty percent of Tor Exits' DNS traffic and so using them as a bridge aids website fingerprinting attacks.  <ref>Although there is evidence that website fingerprinting is more difficult to mount than previously thought. See: [https://nymity.ch/tor-dns/tor-dns.pdf The Effect of DNS on Torâ€™s Anonymity]</ref>

= Finding a Bridge and Choosing the Right Protocol =
In order to use bridges, the address of at least one bridge must be known in advance. It is preferable to have a {{Code2|private obfuscated bridge}} because the alternative - {{Code2|public obfuscated bridges}} - have a greater likelihood of being censored, since they are publicly listed. The Tor Project distributes {{Code2|public bridge}} addresses in several ways, including from their [https://bridges.torproject.org/ website] and via email. The easiest way to find a list of public bridges is from [https://bridges.torproject.org/options The Tor Project Bridge Database].

As of early 2017, The Tor Project advice is that the recommended bridge type has been changed: <ref>https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/18072</ref>

<blockquote>... in Tor Browser to obfs4, given that we now have several high capacity obfs4 bridges and obfs4 is more likely to work in more regions than obfs3."
</blockquote>
As time goes on and more {{Code2|obfs4}} bridge operators go online, it may be preferable to use {{Code2|obfs4}} instead of {{Code2|obfs3}}, as {{Code2|obfs4}}: <ref>https://blog.torproject.org/blog/recent-and-upcoming-developments-pluggable-transports#obfs2_deprecation</ref>
<blockquote> ... should be able to defend more effectively against active probing.</blockquote>

The Tor Project provides a database of [https://bridges.torproject.org/bridges?transport=obfs3 {{Code2|public obfs3 bridges}}] and [https://bridges.torproject.org/bridges?transport=obfs4 {{Code2|public obfs4 bridges}}] A more exhaustive list of public obfuscated bridges is available at [https://bridges.torproject.org/options The Tor Project Bridge Database]. It is not recommended to use {{Code2|obfs}} and {{Code2|obfs2}} bridges, which: <ref>https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges.html.en#PluggableTransports</ref> 
<blockquote>... are now deprecated and were replaced by {{Code2|obfs3}} . . . and {{Code2|obfs4}}.</blockquote>
Do not select the "IPv6 compatible" check box when [https://bridges.torproject.org/options sourcing bridges] from the database, as they [https://phabricator.whonix.org/T509 cannot be used in Whonix] yet.

= How to Use Bridges in Whonix =
=== Introduction ===
This section will explain how to use (private) obfuscated bridges in Whonix.

Whonix does not yet include a wizard to assist in setting up bridges before connecting to Tor. The graphical [[Tor_Browser#tor-launcher_vs_torbrowser-launcher|tor-launcher]] ([[Dev/tor-launcher|screenshots]]) that some users might know from The Tor Project's Tor Browser cannot be used in Whonix.

{{Code2|obfs2}}, {{Code2|obfs3}} and {{Code2|obfs4}} bridges can currently be configured on Whonix-Gateway. The process is identical to the steps completed on a Debian platform because [[About#Based_on_Debian|Whonix is based on Debian]]. Bridges are configured by simply editing {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}} within the Whonix-Gateway.

=== Step 1: Access {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}} to Add Bridges ===
{{Open_/etc/tor/torrc}}

=== Step 2: Edit {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}} ===

Note: This step is the same on all Whonix platforms.

Once inside {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}, scoll all the way to the bottom of the file and copy and paste the following text.
{{CodeSelect|code=
UseBridges 1
ClientTransportPlugin obfs2,obfs3 exec /usr/bin/obfsproxy managed
ClientTransportPlugin obfs4 exec /usr/bin/obfs4proxy
}}

<ref>
{{CodeSelect|code=
ClientTransportPlugin fte exec /usr/bin/fteproxy --managed
}}
</ref>

Now the bridge IP addresses you discovered in the section [[#Finding_a_bridge_and_choosing_the_right_protocol|Finding a Bridge and Choosing the Right Protocol]] must be added to the file.

Copy and paste those IP addresses to the very bottom of {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}, <u>after the ClientTransportPlugin entries</u>. Make sure to manually add the text "bridge" at the beginning of each line entry.

In the <i>obfs3</i> and <i>obfs4</i> examples below:
* '''Do not copy and paste this list of bridge entries to the torrc file.''' They will not work.
* Make sure you have already retrieved your own [https://bridges.torproject.org/bridges?transport=obfs3 obfs3 bridges] or better yet [https://bridges.torproject.org/bridges?transport=obfs4 obfs4 bridges] from The Tor Project.
* Use '''either''' the <i>obfs3</i> or <i>obfs4</i> protocol, not both.
* '''Capitalization in the torrc file matters.''' Bridges will not connect if you enter "Bridge" instead of "bridge" etc.


{{Code2|Obfs3}} example text to add to {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}.

{{CodeSelect|code=
bridge obfs3 109.195.132.77:22321 4352e58420e68f5e40bf7c74faddccd9d1349413

= Troubleshooting =
== Connection Issues ==
After configuration, connection problems can relate to firewall settings that block outgoing connections to the ports provided by the bridge. To check the {{Code2|port}} the bridge is using, see the following example.

<pre>
bridge 109.195.132.77:22321
</pre>

In this example, the IP address is {{Code2|109.195.132.77}}, while the the port is {{Code2|22321}}.

Try using a (private) (obfuscated) bridge that uses port {{Code2|80}} or {{Code2|443}}, as these ports are mostly used for web browsing and therefore usually unblocked.

== Trying Packet Size and Timing Obfuscation for obfs4 ==

If a provided {{Code2|obfs4}} bridge doesn't work, the user can try enabling packet size and timing obfuscation by changing the <code>iat-mode</code> value in each last line to either <code>1</code> or <code>2</code>. <ref>
 1 = Enabled: ScrambleSuit-style with bulk throughput optimizations.
 2 = Paranoid: Each IAT write will send a length sampled from the length distribution (expensive). See: https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-commits/2014-August/079402.html</ref>

== Better Connectivity Without Real Censorship Circumvention ==

{{Just Connectivity}}

The following will limit Tor to establish only connections to the public Tor network relays that listen on ports {{Code2|80}} and {{Code2|443}}.

{{Open /etc/tor/torrc}}

Add. <ref>
https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en#FascistFirewall
</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
FascistFirewall 1
}}

Save.

{{Reload Tor}}

Done.

== Missing ClientTransportPlugin Line ==
When one is using.

{{CodeSelect|code=
bridge obfs4 ...:... ... cert=... iat-mode=0
}}

But forgot to add the corresponding line.

{{CodeSelect|code=
ClientTransportPlugin obfs4 exec /usr/bin/obfs4proxy
}}

Then only a warning will be shown in the logs.

<pre>
[warn] We were supposed to connect to bridge '...:...' using pluggable transport 'obfs4', but we can't find a pluggable transport proxy supporting 'obfs4'. This can happen if you haven't provided a ClientTransportPlugin line, or if your pluggable transport proxy stopped running.
</pre>

== Missing ClientTransportPlugin Executable ==
<pre>
[warn] Could not launch managed proxy executable at '/usr/bin/obfs4proxy' ('No such file or directory').
</pre>
