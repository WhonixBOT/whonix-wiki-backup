= Bridges Description and User Groups =

== Introduction ==

When Tor is used with {{project name}} in the default configuration, anybody observing the flow of network traffic from the Internet connection can determine that Tor is being used. Potential observers include the Internet Service Provider (ISP), advanced adversaries, censorship enforcement bodies and other interested parties.

[https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges Tor bridges ("Tor bridge relays")] are alternative entry points to the Tor network, not all of which are listed publicly. Using a bridge makes it harder, but not impossible, for the ISP to determine a user is connecting to Tor.

{{mbox
| type      = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text       = If a website cannot be reached over Tor, this does not necessarily relate to network level censorship that requires a bridge to be configured; it may relate to blacklisting of Tor IP addresses by the server. In that case, [[Tor_Browser#Bypass_Tor_Censorship|simple bypass methods]] usually succeed in circumventing censorship by destination servers. It is rarely necessary to combine Tor with a proxy, VPN or SSH tunnel in order to access content or services that are blocked.
}}

== Intended User Groups ==

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = Tor non-functionality is often related to [https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#DoesntWork local configuration problems] rather than ISP or state-level censorship.
}}


For the majority of {{project name}} users, connecting to Tor with the default configuration is appropriate and will work successfully. The minority of users requiring a bridge normally fall into three categories: <ref>https://blog.torproject.org/different-ways-use-bridge</ref>

<blockquote>
* Tor is blocked, and some way - any way - to reach the network has to be found. The adversary is not very dangerous, but very annoying.
* Tor may or may not be blocked, but the user is trying to hide the fact they're using Tor. The adversary may be extremely dangerous.
*Other bridge users: Testing whether the bridge works (automated or manual), probing, people using bridges without their knowledge because they came pre-configured in their bundle.</blockquote>

The first group of users is only concerned with circumventing Tor censorship that is based on IP address or fingerprinting of protocols. Circumvention is necessary because {{project name}} would otherwise be rendered useless for most activities except working offline on documents and so on, since all Internet traffic is routed through Tor by default. This group is not worried about hiding the use of Tor and will need to use bridges or possibly [[Censorship_Circumvention_Tools|other circumvention tools]].

The second user group is unable to safely start {{project name}} in the default configuration due to Tor being considered dangerous or suspicious in their locality. In this case [[Hide_Tor_and_Whonix_from_your_ISP|private bridges or a VPN/SSH tunnel]] should be utilized instead of public obfuscated bridges, as this makes it ''harder'' (not impossible) to detect Tor. <ref>Over time, censors have gotten better at detecting Tor network traffic between the client and the first hop, even with the use of more advanced pluggable transports. There is a cyber-censorship arms race in effect.</ref>  Note that <code>meek_lite</code> pluggable transports may be necessary to deal with highly aggressive ISP censorship or national firewalls, like those found in China and the Middle East.

The third group is only concerned with testing bridge connections.

== Before Configuring a Bridge ==

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text       = 
'''Warning:''' Bridges are important tools that work in many cases but they are <u>not</u> an absolute protection against the technical progress an adversary might make in identifying Tor users. Using bridges <u>might</u> be advisable to prevent identification as a Tor user, but the Tor Project's [https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges bridges documentation] is primarily focused on censorship circumvention, that is, overcoming attempts by ISPs or government to block Tor use.
}}


Users falling into one of the three groups described above should consider using Tor bridges. Before taking this step, please review The Tor Project's [https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges dedicated page about bridges] to better understand their design and operation. It is also recommended to review [https://www.torproject.org/projects/obfsproxy.html.en how Obfsproxy works], since it is the most commonly used application for connecting bridges.

Always remember that bridges are not bullet-proof. The following is a reminder about bridge versus non-bridge anonymity: <ref>https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-May/024378.html</ref>

<blockquote>Bridges are less reliable and tend to have lower performance than other entry points. If you live in a uncensored area, they are not necessarily more secure than entry guards.</blockquote>

{{Just Connectivity}} See [[Bridges#Better_Connectivity_Without_Real_Censorship_Circumvention|Better Connectivity without Real Censorship Circumvention]].

== Additional Information and Recommendations ==
{{mbox
| type      = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text       = For safety reasons, the first run of {{project name}} <u>will not</u> automatically connect to the public Tor network. Instead, user networking decisions are guided by [[Anon_Connection_Wizard|Anon Connection Wizard]] which automatically starts.
}}


When deciding on the type of bridge to configure, it is recommended to:

* Prefer [https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges#PluggableTransports {{Code2|obfuscated bridges}}], since they are harder to identify than other bridges.
* Use less well-known bridges, since it is safer. <ref>Some bridge addresses are freely provided by the Tor website or by email upon request, meaning adversaries likely use these methods to obtain bridge information. The Tor Project has some protection against adversary threats, but they are far from perfect.</ref>
* Consider whether [[Hide Tor and {{project name}} from your ISP|Hiding Tor and {{project name}} from your ISP]] is advisable in your circumstances.
* Avoid using a meek provider that also runs DNS core servers, like Google's (now defunct) bridge. <ref>Google sees forty percent of Tor Exits' DNS traffic and so using them as a bridge aids website fingerprinting attacks. That said, there is evidence that website fingerprinting is more difficult to mount than previously thought. See: [https://nymity.ch/tor-dns/tor-dns.pdf The Effect of DNS on Torâ€™s Anonymity]</ref>
* Note that domain fronting [https://blog.torproject.org/domain-fronting-critical-open-web has been pulled by Google and Amazon], limiting the <code>meek_lite</code> pluggable transport options.
* For greater safety, use a {{Code2|private obfuscated bridge}} bridge run by a trusted friend or organization in a different country. In this case "{{Code2|private}}" means that the bridge is configured with the option {{Code2|PublishServerDescriptor 0}}. <ref>
[https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en#PublishServerDescriptor Tor manual: PublishServerDescriptor] 
Without this option set, The Tor Project can learn about the bridge and may distribute its address to others, potentially handing this information to an adversary seeking to generate a list of all known bridges.</ref>

= Finding a Bridge and Choosing the Right Protocol =
In order to use bridges, the address of at least one bridge must be known in advance. It is preferable to have a {{Code2|private obfuscated bridge}} because the alternative -- {{Code2|public obfuscated bridges}} -- are more likely to be censored, since they are publicly listed. The Tor Project distributes {{Code2|public bridge}} addresses in several ways, including from their [https://bridges.torproject.org/ website] and via email. The easiest way to find a list of public bridges is from [https://bridges.torproject.org/options The Tor Project Bridge Database].

In early 2017, The Tor Project advice regarding recommended bridges changed: <ref>https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/18072</ref>

<blockquote>... in Tor Browser to obfs4, given that we now have several high capacity obfs4 bridges and obfs4 is more likely to work in more regions than obfs3."
</blockquote>
As time goes on and more {{Code2|obfs4}} bridge operators come online, it may be preferable to use {{Code2|obfs4}} instead of {{Code2|obfs3}}, as the former: <ref>https://blog.torproject.org/blog/recent-and-upcoming-developments-pluggable-transports#obfs2_deprecation</ref>
<blockquote> ... should be able to defend more effectively against active probing.</blockquote>

The Tor Project provides a database of [https://bridges.torproject.org/bridges?transport=obfs3 {{Code2|public obfs3 bridges}}] and [https://bridges.torproject.org/bridges?transport=obfs4 {{Code2|public obfs4 bridges}}]. A more exhaustive list of public obfuscated bridges is available at [https://bridges.torproject.org/options The Tor Project Bridge Database]. It is not recommended to use {{Code2|obfs}} and {{Code2|obfs2}} bridges, which: <ref>https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges.html.en#PluggableTransports</ref> 
<blockquote>... are now deprecated and were replaced by {{Code2|obfs3}} . . . and {{Code2|obfs4}}.</blockquote>
Do not select the "IPv6 compatible" check box when [https://bridges.torproject.org/options sourcing bridges] from the database, as they [https://phabricator.whonix.org/T509 cannot be used in Whonix] yet.

= How to Use Bridges in {{project name}} =
This section will explain how to use bridges in {{project name}} 14 and above.

It is possible to configure {{Code2|obfs3}}, {{Code2|obfs4}}, and {{Code2|meek_lite}} bridges.

For most users, the [[Anon_Connection_Wizard|Anon Connection Wizard]] GUI application is recommended. Advanced users also have the option of [[Tor#Manual_Bridge_Configuration|Manual Bridge Configuration]].

==== Step 1: Start Anon Connection Wizard ====

{{Start_Anon_Connection_Wizard}}

==== Step 2: Use the Bridge Configuration Page ====

{{Anon_Connection_Wizard_Use_Bridges}}

= Troubleshooting =
== Check Tor Network Connection is Using a Tor Bridge ==
Concerned bridge users can complete a simple check.

1. Open [[Tor_Controller#Arm|Arm]] as follows.

{{Start_Arm}}

2. Use the right arrow button to navigate to page 2 of 5 in Arm.

3. If a bridge is in use, the circuit information will be similar to this.

<pre>
192.168.0.1 UNKNOWN 1 / Guard
</pre>

4. If a bridge is ''not'' in use, the circuit information will be similar to this.
<pre>
IP Nickname 1 / Guard
</pre>
The IP is the real IP (''not'' 192.168.0.1) of the Guard, and the Nickname is the name of that Guard relay.

5. Exit Arm by pressing the following.
<pre>
q
q
</pre>

== Connection Issues ==
After configuration, connection problems can relate to firewall settings that block outgoing connections to the ports provided by the bridge. To check the {{Code2|port}} the bridge is using, see the following example.

<pre>
bridge 109.195.132.77:22321
</pre>

In this example, the IP address is {{Code2|109.195.132.77}}, while the the port is {{Code2|22321}}.

Try using a (private) (obfuscated) bridge that uses port {{Code2|80}} or {{Code2|443}}, as these ports are mostly used for web browsing and therefore usually unblocked.

== Trying Packet Size and Timing Obfuscation for obfs4 ==

If a provided {{Code2|obfs4}} bridge does not work, the user can try enabling packet size and timing obfuscation by changing the <code>iat-mode</code> value in each last line to either <code>1</code> or <code>2</code>. <ref>
 1 = Enabled: ScrambleSuit-style with bulk throughput optimizations.
 2 = Paranoid: Each IAT write will send a length sampled from the length distribution (expensive). See: https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-commits/2014-August/079402.html</ref>

== Better Connectivity Without Real Censorship Circumvention ==

{{Just Connectivity}}

The following setting only establishes Tor connections to public Tor network relays that listen on ports {{Code2|80}} and {{Code2|443}}.

{{Open /usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf}}

Add. <ref>
https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en#FascistFirewall
</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
FascistFirewall 1
}}

Save.

{{Reload Tor}}

The procedure is complete.

== Missing ClientTransportPlugin Line ==
When a user has configured the following.

{{CodeSelect|code=
bridge obfs4 ...:... ... cert=... iat-mode=0
}}

But forgot to add the corresponding line.

{{CodeSelect|code=
ClientTransportPlugin obfs4 exec /usr/bin/obfs4proxy
}}

Then warnings will only be shown in logs.

<pre>
[warn] We were supposed to connect to bridge '...:...' using pluggable transport 'obfs4', but we can't find a pluggable transport proxy supporting 'obfs4'. This can happen if you haven't provided a ClientTransportPlugin line, or if your pluggable transport proxy stopped running.
</pre>

== Missing ClientTransportPlugin Executable ==
<pre>
[warn] Could not launch managed proxy executable at '/usr/bin/obfs4proxy' ('No such file or directory').
</pre>
