= Bridges Description and User Groups =

== Introduction ==

{{mbox
| type      = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = If a website cannot be reached over Tor, this does not necessarily relate to network level censorship that requires a bridge to be configured; it may relate to blacklisting of all Tor exit IP addresses by the server. In that case, [[Tor_Browser#Bypass_Tor_Censorship|simple bypass methods]] usually succeeds in circumventing censorship by destination servers. It is rarely necessary to combine Tor with a proxy, VPN or SSH tunnel in order to access content or services that are blocked.
}}

When Tor is used with {{project name}} in the default configuration, anybody observing the properties of its application protocol can discover its presence. Potential observers include the Internet Service Provider (ISP), advanced adversaries, censorship enforcement bodies and other interested parties.

[https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/bridges Tor bridges ("Tor bridge relays")] are alternative entry points to the Tor network, acting as substitutes to regular Tor guards rather than an additional hop to the 3 hop journey. Not all bridges are obtainable publicly. Using a bridge makes it harder, but not impossible, for the ISP to determine a user is connecting to Tor.

== Intended User Groups ==

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = Tor non-functionality is often related to [https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#DoesntWork local configuration problems] rather than ISP or state-level censorship.
}}

For the majority of {{project name}} users, connecting to Tor with the default configuration is appropriate and will work successfully. The minority of users requiring a bridge normally fall into three categories: <ref>https://blog.torproject.org/different-ways-use-bridge</ref>

<blockquote>
* Tor is blocked, and some way - any way - to reach the network has to be found. The adversary is not very dangerous, but very annoying.
* Tor may or may not be blocked, but the user is trying to hide the fact they're using Tor. The adversary may be extremely dangerous.
*Other bridge users: Testing whether the bridge works (automated or manual), probing, people using bridges without their knowledge because they came pre-configured in their bundle.</blockquote>

The first group of users is only concerned with circumventing Tor censorship that is based on IP address or fingerprinting of protocols. Circumvention is necessary because {{project name}} would otherwise be rendered useless for most activities except working offline on documents and so on, since all Internet traffic is routed through Tor by default. This group is not worried about hiding the use of Tor and will need to use bridges or possibly [[Censorship_Circumvention_Tools|other circumvention tools]].

The second user group is unable to safely start {{project name}} in the default configuration due to Tor being considered dangerous or suspicious in their locality. In this case [[Hide_Tor_and_{{project name short}}_from_your_ISP|private bridges or a VPN/SSH tunnel]] should be utilized instead of public obfuscated bridges, as this makes it ''harder'' (not impossible) to detect Tor. <ref>Over time, censors have gotten better at detecting Tor network traffic between the client and the first hop, even with the use of more advanced pluggable transports. There is a cyber-censorship arms race in effect.</ref>

Note that the <code>meek_azure</code> pluggable transport may be necessary to deal with highly aggressive ISP censorship or national firewalls, like those found in China and the Middle East.

The third group is only concerned with testing bridge connections.

== Before Configuring a Bridge ==

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text    = 
'''Warning:''' Bridges are important tools that work in many cases but they are <u>not</u> an absolute protection against the technical progress an adversary might make in identifying Tor users. Using bridges <u>might</u> be advisable to prevent identification as a Tor user, but the Tor Project's [https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/bridges bridges documentation] is primarily focused on censorship circumvention, that is, overcoming attempts by ISPs or government to block Tor use.
}}

Users falling into one of the three groups described above should consider using Tor bridges. Before taking this step, please review The Tor Project's [https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/bridges dedicated bridges page] to better understand their design and operation. It is also recommended to review [https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports how Obfsproxy works], since it is the most commonly used application for connecting bridges.

Always remember that bridges are not bullet-proof. The following is a reminder about bridge versus non-bridge anonymity:

[https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-May/024378.html Quote] Roger Dingledine, cofounder of Tor:

<blockquote>
[...] Bridges are less reliable and tend to have lower performance than other entry points. If you live in a uncensored area, they are not necessarily more secure than entry guards. [...]
</blockquote>

Quote question:

<blockquote>
If that is true, that also means, that bridge users are sufficiently more vulnerable to attacks, which are circumvented by entry guards?
</blockquote>

[https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-May/024378.html Quote] Roger Dingledine, cofounder of Tor:

<blockquote>
[...] They're probably more vulnerable, but I don't know if I'd say "sufficiently". [...]
</blockquote>

If a user is only concerned with connectivity (getting Whonix connected) and local ISPs do not usually hinder connections to the public Tor network, then something simpler than Bridges can be tried; see: [[Bridges#Better_Connectivity_without_Real_Censorship_Circumvention|Better Connectivity without Real Censorship Circumvention]].

== Additional Information and Recommendations ==

{{mbox
| type      = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = For safety reasons, the first run of {{project name}} <u>will not</u> automatically connect to the public Tor network. Instead, user networking decisions are guided by [[Anon_Connection_Wizard|Anon Connection Wizard]] which automatically starts.
}}

When deciding on the type of bridge to configure, it is recommended to:

* Prefer [https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/bridges#PluggableTransports {{Code2|obfuscated bridges}}], since they are harder to identify than other bridges.
* Use less well-known bridges, since it is safer. <ref>Some bridge addresses are freely provided by the Tor website or by email upon request, meaning adversaries likely use these methods to obtain bridge information. The Tor Project has some protection against adversary threats, but they are far from perfect.</ref>
* Avoid using a meek provider that also runs DNS core servers, like Google's (now defunct) bridge. <ref>Google sees forty percent of Tor Exits' DNS traffic and so using them as a bridge aids website fingerprinting attacks. That said, there is evidence that website fingerprinting is more difficult to mount than previously thought. See: [https://nymity.ch/tor-dns/tor-dns.pdf The Effect of DNS on Tor’s Anonymity]</ref>
* Note that domain fronting [https://blog.torproject.org/domain-fronting-critical-open-web has been pulled by Google and Amazon], limiting the meek pluggable transport options to <code>meek_azure</code> only in Anon Connection Wizard.
* For greater safety, use a {{Code2|private obfuscated bridge}} bridge run by a trusted friend or organization in a different country. In this case "{{Code2|private}}" means that the bridge is configured with the option {{Code2|PublishServerDescriptor 0}}. <ref>
[https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en#PublishServerDescriptor Tor manual: PublishServerDescriptor] 
Without this option set, The Tor Project can learn about the bridge and may distribute its address to others, potentially handing this information to an adversary seeking to generate a list of all known bridges.</ref>

Please note that it has been assessed as difficult beyond practicality to [[Hide_Tor_from_your_Internet_Service_Provider|Hide Tor use from the Internet Service Provider]] with proxies, bridges, VPNs or SSH tunnels.

= Finding a Bridge and Choosing the Right Protocol =
In order to use bridges, the address of at least one bridge must be known in advance. It is preferable to have a {{Code2|private obfuscated bridge}} because the alternative -- {{Code2|public obfuscated bridges}} -- are more likely to be censored, since they are publicly listed. The Tor Project distributes {{Code2|public bridge}} addresses in several ways, including from their [https://bridges.torproject.org/ website] and via email. The easiest way to find a list of public bridges is from [https://bridges.torproject.org/options The Tor Project Bridge Database].

In early 2017, The Tor Project advice regarding recommended bridges changed: <ref>
https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/18072
</ref> <ref>
This pluggable transport has been deprecated by The Tor Project in favor of [https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports.html.en obfs4, meek, Format-Transforming Encryption (FTE) and ScrambleSuit].
</ref>

<blockquote>... in Tor Browser to obfs4, given that we now have several high capacity obfs4 bridges and obfs4 is more likely to work in more regions than obfs3."
</blockquote>
As time has gone on, more {{Code2|obfs4}} bridge operators have come online, and {{Code2|obfs4}} is now routinely recommended by Tor developers over {{Code2|obfs3}}, because the former: <ref>
https://blog.torproject.org/blog/recent-and-upcoming-developments-pluggable-transports#obfs2_deprecation
</ref>
<blockquote>
... should be able to defend more effectively against active probing.
</blockquote> As a consequence, obfs3 bridges have been deprecated as a configurable pluggable transport option in Tor Browser. <ref>https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/bridges.html.en#PluggableTransports
</ref> <ref>https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports.html.en</ref> Also see: [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/PluggableTransports/Obfs4Evaluation obfs4 Transport Evaluation]. <ref>
<blockquote>
The obfs4 protocol was developed and is in the process of being deployed by the Tor Project in response to the vulnerability of the obfs3 protocol to detection via active probing attacks. It is expected to supersede the obfs3 protocol as the front-line Pluggable Transport used by most Tor users.
</blockquote>
</ref>

The Tor Project provides a database of [https://bridges.torproject.org/bridges?transport=obfs4 {{Code2|public obfs4 bridges}}]. A more exhaustive list of public obfuscated bridges is available at [https://bridges.torproject.org/options The Tor Project Bridge Database]. {{Code2|obfs}} and {{Code2|obfs2}} bridges are no longer available since they: <ref>https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges.html.en#PluggableTransports</ref> 
<blockquote>
... are now deprecated and were replaced by {{Code2|obfs3}} . . . and {{Code2|obfs4}}.
</blockquote>
Do not select the "IPv6 compatible" check box when [https://bridges.torproject.org/options sourcing bridges] from the database, as they [https://phabricator.whonix.org/T509 cannot be used in {{project_name}}] yet.

= How to Use Bridges in {{project name}} =

It is possible to configure {{Code2|obfs4}} and {{Code2|meek_azure}} bridges.

For most users, the [[Anon_Connection_Wizard|Anon Connection Wizard]] GUI application is recommended. Advanced users also have the option of [[Tor#Manual_Bridge_Configuration|Manual Bridge Configuration]].

== Snowflake ==

The Tor Project describes the design of the Snowflake pluggable transport: <ref>https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/Snowflake</ref>
<blockquote>Snowflake is a [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/PluggableTransports pluggable transport] that proxies traffic through temporary proxies using ​[https://webrtc.org/ WebRTC], a peer-to-peer protocol with built-in NAT punching. It aims to work kind of like flash proxy, but without flash proxy's problems with NAT.</blockquote>

Configuration of Snowflake in {{project_name}} is only recommended for advanced users because it is difficult to get the <code>snowflake-client</code> into {{gateway product name}} ([[Qubes|Qubes-Whonix]]: <code>{{whonix-gw}}</code>).

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Locate the <code>snowflake-client</code> client.

The binary <code>snowflake-client</code> can be found in:
* <code>/var/cache/tb-binary/.tb/tor-browser/Browser/TorBrowser/Tor/PluggableTransports/snowflake-client</code> in {{workstation product name}} <ref><code>/home/user/.tb/tor-browser/Browser/TorBrowser/Tor/PluggableTransports/snowflake-client</code></ref>; or 
* in the Tor Browser alpha download for Linux from torproject.org <ref>https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/19001</ref> -- once extracted it is found in the <code>tor-browser</code> folder in sub folder <code>./Browser/TorBrowser/Tor/PluggableTransports/snowflake-client</code>. 

'''2.''' Move the <code>snowflake-client</code> client.

Move the <code>snowflake-client</code> to a location in {{gateway product name}}. Afterward it needs to be copied to <code>/usr/bin/snowflake-client</code>.

The following command assumes the user is directly inside the home folder <code>/home/user</code> (which is the default when starting a terminal emulator) on {{gateway product name}}, and already has the file <code>/home/user/snowflake-client</code>. The path to <code>snowflake-client</code> might need to be adjusted.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo cp snowflake-client /usr/bin/snowflake-client
}}

'''3.''' Make <code>snowflake-client</code> readable and executable.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo chmod og+rx /usr/bin/snowflake-client
}}

'''4.''' Edit the Tor configuration file.

{{Open /usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf}}

'''5.''' Paste the following setting.

{{CodeSelect|code=
UseBridges 1
ClientTransportPlugin snowflake exec /usr/bin/snowflake-client -url https://snowflake-broker.azureedge.net/ -front ajax.aspnetcdn.com -ice stun:stun.l.google.com:19302
Bridge snowflake 0.0.3.0:1 2B280B23E1107BB62ABFC40DDCC8824814F80A72
}}

'''6.''' Save the file and have the changes take effect.

{{Restart Tor}}

The procedure is complete.

<ref>
Fortunately <code>snowflake-client</code> is a standalone binary that can be easily copied.

AppArmor has appropriate permissions for Snowflake operation. [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-gw-anonymizer-config/blob/master/etc/apparmor.d/local/system_tor.anondist /etc/apparmor.d/local/system_tor] already contains <code>/usr/bin/snowflake-client ix,</code>.</ref>

== Check Tor Network Connection is Using a Tor Bridge ==
Concerned bridge users can complete a simple check.
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Open [[Tor_Controller#Nyx|Nyx]] as follows.

{{Start_Arm}}

'''2.''' Use the right arrow button to navigate to page 2 of 5 in Nyx.

'''3.''' If a bridge is in use, the circuit information will be similar to this.

<pre>
192.168.0.1 UNKNOWN 1 / Guard
</pre>

'''4.''' If a bridge is ''not'' in use, the circuit information will be similar to this.
<pre>
IP Nickname 1 / Guard
</pre>
The IP is the real IP (''not'' 192.168.0.1) of the Guard, and the Nickname is the name of that Guard relay.

'''5.''' Exit Nyx by pressing the following.
<pre>

</pre>
}}

== Connection Issues ==
After configuration, connection problems can relate to firewall settings that block outgoing connections to the ports provided by the bridge. To check the {{Code2|port}} the bridge is using, see the following example.

<pre>
bridge 109.195.132.77:22321
</pre>

In this example, the IP address is {{Code2|109.195.132.77}}, while the the port is {{Code2|22321}}.

Try using a (private) (obfuscated) bridge that uses port {{Code2|80}} or {{Code2|443}}, as these ports are mostly used for web browsing and therefore usually unblocked.

== Trying Packet Size and Timing Obfuscation for obfs4 ==

If a provided {{Code2|obfs4}} bridge does not work, the user can try enabling packet size and timing obfuscation by changing the <code>iat-mode</code> value in each last line to either <code>1</code> or <code>2</code>. <ref>
 1 = Enabled: ScrambleSuit-style with bulk throughput optimizations.
 2 = Paranoid: Each IAT write will send a length sampled from the length distribution (expensive). See: https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-commits/2014-August/079402.html</ref>

== Better Connectivity without Real Censorship Circumvention ==

If a user is only concerned with connectivity (getting Whonix connected) and there is no need to ''attempt'' to [[Hide_Tor_from_your_Internet_Service_Provider|Hide Tor use from the Internet Service Provider]] and/or local ISPs do not usually hinder connections to the public Tor network, then something simpler than [[Bridges]] can be tried.

The following setting only establishes Tor connections to public Tor network relays that listen on ports {{Code2|80}} and {{Code2|443}}.
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Edit the Tor configuration file.

{{Open /usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf}}

'''2.''' Add the following setting. <ref>
https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en#FascistFirewall
</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
FascistFirewall 1
}}

'''3.''' Save the file and have the changes take effect.

{{Reload Tor}}

The procedure is complete.

== Missing ClientTransportPlugin Line ==
When a user has configured the following.

{{CodeSelect|code=
bridge obfs4 ...:... ... cert=... iat-mode=0
}}

But forgot to add the corresponding line.

{{CodeSelect|code=
ClientTransportPlugin obfs4 exec /usr/bin/obfs4proxy
}}

Then warnings will only be shown in logs.

= Hosting Bridges =
While most of this page is dedicated to bridge use, this section clarifies a few concepts about Tor Bridge hosting and doesn't provide a detailed how-to. To help others you have to have a reasonably fast connection and reside in a country that doesn't censor Tor. The VM or host you are using should have port forwarding enabled to allow direct connections. All bridge server types need this even Snowflake.

Volunteer Snowflakes run proxies to the bridge and are *not bridges themselves*. These proxies can be run behind a NAT because clients use the built-in NAT punching properties of WebRTC to connect. The proxies then open a WebSocket connection the Snowflake bridge and relay data between the WebRTC connection with the client and the bridge. The Snowflake bridges cannot run behind a NAT and are similar to all other existing PTs in this regard.<ref>https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/Snowflake</ref>

Using bridge users' traffic to mask your own Onion service traffic is difficult to do properly<ref>https://github.com/mikeperry-tor/vanguards/blob/master/README_SECURITY.md#the-best-way-to-run-tor-relays-or-bridges-with-your-service</ref> and may be of questionable efficacy if traffic is not heavy and other PT's bridge traffic is likely easily excluded by advanced adversarial traffic analysis. In order to implement a similar defense using a Snowflake proxy (as opposed to bridge) a custom client needs to be written that would encapsulate your Tor traffic and send it through a TCP WebSocket connection to the
Snowflake bridge. This measure is ineffective for the same reasons bridge cover traffic is not. To really have a chance of other traffic providing cover, client traffic needs to be mixed with concurrent relayed Tor relay traffic, which may require a relatively high speed main network relay to happen frequently enough to help. Note that website fingerprinting of client traffic is not a severe enough threat to warrant
this type of defense for clearnet-destined tor traffic, but it is helpful in case of protecting against end-to-end correlation attacks.<ref>https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2020-January/014127.html</ref><ref>https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#BetterAnonymity</ref>.
