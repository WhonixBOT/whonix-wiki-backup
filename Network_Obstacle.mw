{{project name}} is a [[What_we_do|research]] and implementation project that is based on thousands of freely available software packages. You can learn more about the organizational structure [[Linux_User_Experience_versus_Commercial_Operating_Systems|here]].

The [[Why_does_Whonix_use_Tor|Tor]] software is used to establish anonymized external connections, but the {{project name}} project does not maintain Tor. Further, the reliance of the {{project name}} platform on Tor does not imply developers are experts about the Tor software.

Some users will experience "network obstacles" when using {{project_name}} because some internet service providers (ISPs) in various countries block (censor, prevent) access to the public Tor network. In this instance, [[Bridges]] may or may not help in circumventing Tor censorship.

When users experience connectivity issues it is unreasonable to automatically assume that the {{project_name}} project is the underlying cause. Nor are {{project_name}} developers experts in resolving various network obstacles. For these reasons, the [[Troubleshooting]] page recommends:

<blockquote>In case of connectivity issues: Check if [https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en Tor Browser] works on the host.</blockquote>

<blockquote>If the Tor Browser Bundle is not functional on the host, then {{project name}} is unlikely to work either. It is recommended to have a recent Tor Browser Bundle version installed at all times. This way users can test if they live in a censored area or not and whether Tor is blocked by the ISP. Further, if (private) (obfuscated) bridges are necessary for Tor Browser Bundle functionality on the host, then {{project name}} will similarly require them.</blockquote>

In conclusion, if connectivity issues are experienced with {{project name}} a sensible first step is to test Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) functionality on the host. If issues persist on the host then the Tor community should be directly contacted about the issue, since the {{project_name}} platform cannot be the primary source of the problem.
