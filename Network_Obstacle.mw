* {{project name}} is a [[What_we_do|research]] and implementation project.
** {{project name}} is based on thousands of freely available software packages. You can learn more about the organizational structure [[Linux_User_Experience_versus_Commercial_Operating_Systems|here]].
* To establish anonymized external connections, {{project name}} uses the [[Why_does_Whonix_use_Tor|Tor]] software.
** {{project name}} project is not the maintainer of the Tor software.
* Creating a software using Tor, i.e. {{project name}} does not make {{project name}} an expert on the Tor software.
* Some internet service providers (ISPs) in some countries block (censor, prevent) access to the public Tor network. This is sometimes called a network obstacle.
* Using [[Bridges]] may or may not help to get around Tor being censored.

In conclusions, the {{project name}} project is in most cases not the cause for connectivity issues nor the expert on resolving network obstacles.

For these reasons, the {{project name}} [[Troubleshooting]] page recommends.

<blockquote>In case of connectivity issues: Check if [https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en Tor Browser] works on the host.</blockquote>

<blockquote>If the Tor Browser Bundle is not functional on the host, then {{project name}} is unlikely to work either. It is recommended to have a recent Tor Browser Bundle version installed at all times. This way users can test if they live in a censored area or not and whether Tor is blocked by the ISP. Further, if (private) (obfuscated) bridges are necessary for Tor Browser Bundle functionality on the host, then {{project name}} will similarly require them.</blockquote>

Therefore, in case you're having connectivity issues with {{project name}}... Forget about {{project name}} for a moment. First try to make the Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) functional on the host. In case of issues, you can contact the Tor community directly without any distractions about potential issues caused by {{project name}}.
