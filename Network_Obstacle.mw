* {{project name}} is a [[What_we_do|research]] and implementation project.
** {{project name}} is based on thousands of freely available software packages. You can learn more about the organizational structure [[Linux_User_Experience_versus_Commercial_Operating_Systems|here]].
* To establish anonymized external connections, {{project name}} uses the [[Why_does_Whonix_use_Tor|Tor]] software.
** {{project name}} project is not the maintainer of the Tor software.
* Creating a software using Tor, i.e. {{project name}} does not make {{project name}} an expert on the Tor software.
* Some internet service providers (ISPs) in some countries block (censor, prevent) access to the public Tor network. This is sometimes called a network obstacle.
* Using [[Bridges]] may or may not help to get around Tor being censored.

In conclusions, the {{project name}} is in most cases not the cause for connectivity issues nor the expert on resolving network obstacles.

For these reasons, the {{projecg name}} [[Troubleshooting]] page recommends.
