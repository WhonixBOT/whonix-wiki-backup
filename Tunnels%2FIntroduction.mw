It is possible to combine Tor with tunnels like VPNs, proxies and SSH. Your traffic can be sent through both Tor and the second tunnel, in either order. However, this is an advanced topic and appropriate only for special cases. Adding a second connection does not automatically add security, but will add significant complexity. In fact, improper combination of Tor and another service [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN may] decrease your security and anonymity. For almost all users of Whonix, using Tor alone – without a VPN or proxy – is the right choice.

=== Connecting to a tunnel (proxy/VPN/SSH) before Tor ===

''' User -> proxy/VPN/SSH -> Tor -> Internet '''

In this case, your internet traffic will (1) pass through your ISP as proxy/VPN/SSH traffic; (2) exit your proxy/VPN/SSH server as encrypted Tor traffic; (3) enter to the Tor network; (4) exit the Tor network at a Tor exit node as normal internet traffic (encrypted or unencrypted).

''' Possible uses: '''
* You must connect to your VPN or proxy to access the internet.
* Your ISP blocks Tor and Tor bridges but doesn’t block the tunnel-link.
* Fear of de-anonymizing attacks against the Tor network; belief that your VPN is able to protect your identity in such case.

''' Warnings: '''
* A VPN or proxy that knows your identity and/or location may be more willing and able to compromise your privacy than your ISP.
* If your software configuration doesn’t block all traffic when your connection to your VPN or proxy suddenly disconnects, your encrypted Tor traffic will go through your ISP without warning. This is the default nature of most VPN configurations and not an issue specific to Whonix.
* If the use of Tor is dangerous in your area, VPNs may not provide enough protection (due to software misconfiguration or sophisticated packet inspection). Proxies do not provide encryption and should not be used to hide Tor use.

=== Connecting to a tunnel (proxy/VPN/SSH) after Tor ===

''' User -> Tor -> proxy/VPN/SSH -> Internet '''

In this case, your internet traffic will (1) pass through your ISP as encrypted Tor traffic; (2) exit the Tor network at a Tor exit node as proxy/VPN/SSH traffic; (3) exit your proxy/VPN/SSH as normal internet traffic (encrypted or unencrypted).

''' Possible uses: '''
* As one part of using a VPN or proxy anonymously for some specific reason.
* You must use Tor, but need to connect to an internet server who bans Tor exit nodes.

''' Warnings: '''
* Even though Tor will hide your IP address from your VPN or proxy, you can still be located with your payment method, usage logs, or other identifying information the service knows about you.
* You will not be able to access Tor hidden services.
