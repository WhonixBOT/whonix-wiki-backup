{{Tunnel Automation Sale}}

It is possible to combine [[Tor]] with tunnels like VPNs, proxies and SSH. The traffic can be sent through both Tor and the second tunnel, in either order. However, this is an advanced topic and appropriate only for special cases. Adding a second connection does not automatically improve security, but it will add significant complexity. The potential [https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/TorPlusVPN positive or negative effects on anonymity] are being [https://matt.traudt.xyz/posts/vpn-tor-not-mRikAa4h.html controversiall]y d[https://gist.github.com/joepie91/5a9909939e6ce7d09e29 ebated]. On the balance of the evidence [[#VPN_Tunnel_Risks|VPNs should be avoided]], and these same arguments could be made against other tunnels too.

The improper combination of Tor and another service may actually degrade a user's security and anonymity. These configurations are difficult to set up and should only be attempted by advanced users. For the vast majority of {{project_name}} users, using Tor in isolation – without a VPN or proxy – is the correct choice.

== Tunnel Link Risks ==

Anonymity can be negatively affected under some circumstances by using an additional tunnel, such as a VPN, proxy or SSH. <ref>https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2016-July/041757.html</ref> <ref>[https://phabricator.whonix.org/T492 research / document impact for tunnel users if Tor relays hosted at the same tunnel provider]</ref> To mitigate any potential risks refer to the background information below, draw your own conclusions and take preventative steps where necessary.

'''Table:''' ''Tunnel Warnings'' 

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! scope="col"| '''Configuration'''
! scope="col"| '''Description'''
|-
! scope="row"| Individual Tunnel Links
| Individual tunnel-links should only be used for a single configuration and never reused in any other tunnel-link chains. If this advice is ignored, any anonymous identities associated with the tunnel-link might be tied to the user's ISP-assigned IP address.
|-
! scope="row"| Qubes Tunnel Configuration
| It is not recommended to run the tunnel software from within a TemplateVM. This is because the <code>{{whonix-gw}}</code> TemplateVM acts more like a workstation since it is behind <code>sys-whonix</code> and is <u>not</u> <code>sys-whonix</code> itself.<br />
<br />
If <code>openvpn</code> is used inside {{gateway_product_name}} (<code>sys-whonix</code>) or {{workstation_product_name}} (<code>anon-whonix</code>) as per the {{project_name}} documentation, <code>openvpn</code> will not start inside the <code>{{whonix-gw}}</code> or <code>{{whonix-ws}}</code> TemplateVM. <ref>This is because file [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/usability-misc/blob/master/lib/systemd/system/openvpn%40openvpn.service.d/50_unpriv.conf /lib/systemd/system/openvpn@openvpn.service.d/50_unpriv.conf] checks the following condition:
<pre>
ConditionPathExists=!/var/run/qubes-service/whonix-template
</pre>
This means if file <code>/var/run/qubes-service/whonix-template</code> exists, which is the case in {{project_name}} TemplateVMs, the {{Code2|openvpn@openvpn}} service will not start.</ref> In Qubes R4 and above, by default the [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/1858 TemplateVMs's NetVM is purposely set to <code>none</code>]. (They are upgraded through the qrexec-based updates proxy that is running on <code>sys-whonix</code>.)
|-
! scope="row"| Tunnel Provider / Configuration
| Do not use the same tunnel provider / configuration in more than one place at the same time. For example, do not use the same tunnel setup inside {{gateway_product_name}} as well as inside {{workstation_product_name}}. Also do not use the same tunnel setup on the host and inside a {{gateway_product_name}} or {{workstation_product_name}} at the same time. <br />
<br />
Example:

In tunnel-chain 1, the ISP-assigned IP address is permanently linked to the tunnel-link. In tunnel-chain 2, the same tunnel-link was reused. Since the user's ISP-assigned IP address was previously linked to that same tunnel-link, the "anonymous" identity can now be linked to the user's actual IP address. 

* <u>Tunnel-chain 1</u>: (<code>User</code> &rarr; <code>Tunnel-link</code> (user's IP address is linked) &rarr; <code>Tor</code> &rarr; <code>Internet</code>)
* <u>Tunnel-chain 2</u>: (<code>User</code> &rarr; <code>Tor</code> &rarr; <code>Tunnel-link</code> (anonymous activities linked) &rarr; <code>Internet</code>)

The previous example also holds true if the tunnel-link is first used with tunnel-chain 2 and then reused in tunnel-chain 1. In this case, all anonymous activities conducted with tunnel-chain 2 would be linked with the user's ISP-assigned IP address.

== VPN Tunnel Risks ==

As noted in the [[#Introduction|introduction]], whether or not VPNs materially improve security and/or anonymity is a hotly debated topic, and a configuration that is frequently raised in the {{project_name}} forums. The consensus opinion of security professionals is that VPNs pose more risks than benefits, and it is for this reason {{project_name}} does not endorse their use.

|-
! scope="row"| Anonymity
| 
* In the <code>User</code> &rarr; <code>VPN</code> &rarr; <code>Internet</code> configuration or <code>User</code> &rarr; <code>VPN</code> &rarr; <code>Tor</code> &rarr; <code>Internet</code> configuration, anonymous payments with Bitcoin, cash and other methods does not improve anonymity because a user is still connecting to the service from their own IP address (which can be logged). <br />
* In the <code>User</code> &rarr; <code>VPN</code> &rarr; <code>Internet</code> configuration or <code>User</code> &rarr; <code>Tor</code> &rarr; <code>VPN</code> &rarr; <code>Internet</code> configuration the use of shared IP addresses does not confuse modern surveillance systems which have a host of additional [[Data_Collection_Techniques|fingerprinting methods]] (like user agents) to identify persons of interest. <br />
* VPN traffic is sensitive to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_packet_inspection Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)] and [https://blog.torproject.org/critique-website-traffic-fingerprinting-attacks Website Traffic Fingerprinting], <ref><blockquote>Website traffic fingerprinting is an attack where the adversary attempts to recognize the encrypted traffic patterns of specific web pages without using any other information. In the case of Tor, this attack would take place between the user and the Guard node, or at the Guard node itself.</blockquote></ref> so it is ineffective in hiding use of {{project_name}} and Tor from the ISP or skilled adversaries.
* Certain variables make it likely {{project_name}} / Tor users can be identified. This includes: the hardened network configuration fingerprint, the list of installed packages and those fetched from repositories, the amount of traffic going to one IP address daily (guard nodes), and examination of dropped (invalid) versus non-dropped packets when the firewall is probed. <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/hiding-tor-whonix-is-difficult-beyond-practicality/7408</ref> <br />
* Apart from a few exceptions (see Use Case Exceptions), VPNs do not provide additional privacy -- it is still possible for adversaries to tap your connection, except at a different point (where traffic leaves the VPN server).
|-
! scope="row"| Design
| 
* VPNs are 'glorified proxies'. Since they can observe all user traffic, there is nothing preventing them from using that data for any purpose they like, including logging. <ref>It could be argued these services truly only exist to sell overpriced bandwidth, with flimsy promises made to attract gullible customers.</ref>
|-
! scope="row"| Logging
|
* Claims that providers do not log user activity are unverifiable; in fact this claim is exactly what could be expected from a malicious provider. <br />
* Recent research reveals that around one-third of all popular VPN providers are owned by Chinese companies, while others are based in countries like Pakistan, with non-existent or weak privacy laws. <ref>
https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252466203/Top-VPNs-secretly-owned-by-Chinese-firms
</ref> The implication is that traffic might be routinely examined in a high percentage of cases, despite corporate promises to the contrary. <br />
* The only safe assumption to make is that all VPN providers log activity in order to deflect potential legal actions and to satisfy government demands for (meta)data on 'suspect' users. <br />
* A number of high profile VPN providers like HideMyAss have already handed over user data in the past; <ref>
https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/09/26/hidemyass_lulzsec_controversy/
</ref> many VPN adherents are unaware of these precedents.
|-
! scope="row"| Malware
|
* VPNs do no necessarily protect against today's advanced malware that tries to discover the true IP address via browser and other exploits. <br />
* Adversaries who can break Tor Browser to make web requests not travel over Tor are probably also capable of: running arbitrary commands as a non-root user, gaining root privileges, or ultimately performing a VM escape from {{project_name}}. In this case a VPN is useless in providing additional security.
|-
! scope="row"| Security
| 
* VPNs do not magically improve security; they are just a glorified proxy. 'Honeypot' or malicious providers might be ubiquitous. <ref>It is logical that governments would set up providers in this manner to attract citizens who have a greater interest in protecting their privacy, since that traffic is deemed more interesting for intelligence purposes.</ref> 
* The need to run additional software like OpenVPN can actually increase the attack surface and complicated configuration instructions can lead to mistakes that <u>reduce</u> overall security.
* The claim of 'additional encryption' does not stack up in providing more security; even with a VPN if the endpoint expects plaintext, it is not technically possible for a VPN to change that. It is still necessary to use SSL/TLS and HTTPS (for centralized services), or end-to-end encryption for P2P and social applications for improved security. <br />
* The only encrypted part of the connection when using a VPN is from the user to the provider. From the VPN provider onward the traffic is the same as it would have been without a VPN. Since the VPN provider can see this traffic (and potentially mess with it), this is arguably a net loss in security.
|-
! scope="row"| Tor + VPN
| 
* The <code>User</code> &rarr; <code>Tor</code> &rarr; <code>VPN</code> &rarr; <code>Internet</code> configuration attempts to display an IP address that is not associated with Tor. <br />
* This throws away many of the anonymity and security benefits associated with Tor and places sole trust in the VPN provider where the traffic exits. <br />
** Traffic is no longer separated on different browser tabs -- a single circuit is built in the Tor network, and this can break local state separation within Tor Browser. <br />
** If other things are done over the VPN connection like SSH traffic, IRC traffic, SMTP or OS updates, all of this traffic is sitting right next to each other. <br />
* Anonymity is affected because the ISP will see connections to the Tor guard (unless trying to hide it with a bridge) and a global adversary is likely capable of performing traffic analysis on the limited number of VPN exit points. Further, the VPN provider is granted greater trust under this configuration.
* This configuration slows down connection speed because there is a TCP stream (OpenVPN) inside of a TCP stream (Tor). <ref>If any of these streams detect packet loss, then there is backing off of the transmission rates and re-transmitting of packets thought to be lost.</ref>
|-
! scope="row"| Trust
| VPN providers represent a single point/entity of potential failure. Unlike Tor which distributes trust across multiple relays, VPN adherents must trust the provider does not: <br />
* keep payment information <br />
* keep logs <br />
* lie about their geolocation (see [https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/north-korea-dprk-bgp-geoip-fruad here])
* share information with adversaries <br />
* get breached by advanced adversaries (see this recent [https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/10/hackers-steal-secret-crypto-keys-for-nordvpn-heres-what-we-know-so-far/ NordVPN breach])
* fail to keep servers secure (see this recent [https://nordvpn.com/blog/torguard-lawsuit/ TorGuard server configuration file error])
|-
! scope="row"| Use Case Exceptions
| There are two ''possible'' use cases that might warrant a VPN provider: <br />
* A potentially 'hostile' network must be used, like those found in public airports (WiFi access points) and where ISPs have a questionable record of man-in-the-middle attacks. (<code>User</code> &rarr; <code>VPN</code> &rarr; <code>Tor</code> &rarr; <code>Internet</code>) <br />
* It is necessary to hide an IP address from non-government-sanctioned adversaries. <ref>In this case, the VPN provider will still be able to snoop on traffic and potentially manipulate it.</ref>
* If a VPN is essential in your circumstances for whatever reason, it is <u>not</u> recommended to set up your own [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server Virtual Private Server (VPS)]. This will lead to a unique fingerprint, and there is no guarantee that a rented server is less likely to be malicious than a standard VPN provider.
|-
! scope="row"| VPN + Tor
| 
* It is questionable the <code>User</code> &rarr; <code>VPN</code> &rarr; <code>Tor</code> &rarr; <code>Internet</code> configuration adds any additional protection; see this [https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/125005/why-is-home-vpn-tor-worse-than-home-tor/125008#125008 stackexchange discussion]. <br />
* If Tor is blocked for whatever reason it is simpler to configure a [[Bridges|bridge]] with a pluggable transport to try and bypass it. <ref>Pluggable transports make Tor traffic look different so it is not fingerprinted, and thus hopefully not blocked.</ref>
* This configuration is unlikely to hide Tor use from a [https://mice.cs.columbia.edu/getTechreport.php?techreportID=556&format=pdf& Global Passive Adversary (GPA)]. Since a GPA is capable of watching all traffic enter and exit the Tor network, they are ''more'' likely to be capable of watching all traffic enter and exit from a single VPN provider. <ref>It is arguably better for a larger Tor user base to form over time and the Tor network to scale up in size to stymie this capability.</ref> <ref>It is likely GPAs will also compromise the most popular VPNs as part of their lawless 'Collect It All' philosophy.</ref> It has been assessed as difficult beyond practicality to [[Hide_Tor_from_your_Internet_Service_Provider|Hide Tor use from the Internet Service Provider]] with proxies, bridges, VPNs or SSH tunnels.

== Challenges in Tunnel-link Provider Selection ==

It is essential to consider the following factors when selecting a tunnel-link provider. Anonymity can be materially affected by the chosen network/operator's location, network/operator/IP address commonality with Tor relays, use of shared infrastructure, and other variables.

'''Table:''' ''Provider Selection Considerations'' 

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! scope="col"| '''Domain'''
! scope="col"| '''Description'''
|-
! scope="row"| End-to-end Correlation (Confirmation) Attacks
| 
* Tor avoids using more than one relay belonging to the same operator in the circuits it is building. Legitimate Tor relay operators adhere to Tor's relay operator practices of announcing which relays belong to them by declaring this in the Tor relay family setting. Tor also avoids using Tor relays that are within the same network by not using relays within the same /16 subnet. <ref>
http://tor.stackexchange.com/a/114/80
</ref> Tor however does not take into account your real external IP address nor destination IP addresses. <ref>
* https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2016-July/041753.html
* https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2016-July/041756.html
</ref>
* In essence, you must avoid using the same network/operator as your first and last Tor relays since this would open up [[Warning#Confirmation_attacks|Confirmation Attacks]].
|-
! scope="row"| Shared IP Addresses
| 
* Many tunnel providers use shared IP addresses which means that many users share the same external IP address. On the one hand this configuration is beneficial, since it is similar to Tor whereby many users share the same Tor exit relays. On the other hand, in some circumstances this may result in making you <u>less</u> anonymous.
|-
! scope="row"| Operator/Network Shared Infrastructure
| 
* It is possible to host Tor relays -- including bridges, entry, middle or exit relays -- behind VPNs or tunnel-links. For example, there are VPN providers that support [https://proprivacy.com/guides/vpn-port-forwarding-guide VPN port forwarding]. This is an interesting way to contribute to Tor while not exposing oneself to too much legal risk. This also means in certain situations a VPN or other tunnel-link could be hosted by the same operator providing support to Tor relays, in the same network or even on the same IP address.
* In an economy with deep labor division, certain operators are providing a service to host servers (VPS etc.), while others provide VPN and other tunnel-link services and rent such servers. It is therefore not uncommon for diverse customers to run or share the same IP address. This is another situation where a VPN or other tunnel-link could be hosted by the same operator supporting Tor relays, in the same network or even on the same IP address.
|-
! scope="row"| Tunnel-link Connection Chain Risk
| 
* Based on the section immediately above, it follows that adding arbitrary tunnel-links might lead to the same operator/network being used twice in your connection chain. Consider the scenarios below.
* <u>Scenario 1</u>:
** A VPN with a fixed IP address is used on the host, thereby it acts as the first relay.
** The same user's Tor client coincidentally selects a Tor exit relay running on the same VPN IP address.
** The user is now using the same IP address as the first and last proxy, meaning overall anonymity is reduced in this scenario.
* <u>Scenario 2</u>:
** A VPN with a fixed IP address is set up inside {{workstation_product_name}}. This results in the connection scheme <code>User</code> &rarr; <code>Tor</code> &rarr; <code>VPN</code> &rarr; <code>Internet</code>.
** A Tor entry guard is also hosted on the VPN IP address.
** The user is now using the same IP address as the first and last proxy, meaning overall anonymity is reduced in this scenario.
|-
! scope="row"| Tunnel Provider Criteria
| 
* Consider the physical location of networks/servers and the legal jurisdiction(s) they are operating in.
* Perhaps avoid using VPN or SSH providers that support port forwarding.
* Perhaps only use tunnel-link providers that are assigning private (non-shared), unique IP addresses. However, as noted earlier it is unclear if this does more harm than good.
* Perhaps use tunnel-link providers that run their own servers rather than relying on shared infrastructure.
|-
! scope="row"| Tor Relay Selection
| 
* It might be safer to manually select your Tor relay(s), specifically the [[Tor_Entry_Guards|Entry Guard(s)]] or [[Bridges|Bridge(s)]] in operation.
* Tor documentation generally discourages tampering with Tor's routing algorithm by manually choosing relays. However, if you have decided to extend the length of the Tor chain -- despite the difficulty of this endeavor and potential adverse anonymity impacts -- then it might make sense to pick the entry guard(s) by hand.
* Using [[Bridges]] might be an alternative, but note this [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-May/024378.html warning from experienced Tor developers]: <blockquote>Bridges are less reliable and tend to have lower performance than other entry points. If you live in a uncensored area, they are not necessarily more secure than entry guards.</blockquote>

* It is necessary to connect to an Internet server who bans Tor exit nodes. <br />
* Concerns exist over de-anonymizing attacks against the Tor network and a user believes a VPN or proxy may help protect their identity in such a case.
|-
! scope="row"| Warnings <ref>These warnings are not specific to {{project_name}}, but are general issues with combining Tor and various tunnel-links.</ref>
| 
* Even though Tor will hide the IP address from the VPN or proxy, you can still be located via payment methods, usage logs, or other identifying information the tunnel-link service holds. <br />
* This configuration prevents access to Tor onion ({{Code2|.onion}}) services. <ref>When configuring <code>User</code> &rarr; <code>Tor</code> &rarr; <code>proxy/VPN/SSH</code> &rarr; <code>Internet</code>, it is impossible to connect to [[Onion Services]] because the last server is not a Tor relay. The only exception is running another Tor client on top, but this would lead to a [[DoNot#Prevent_Tor_over_Tor_scenarios|Tor over Tor scenario]] which is discouraged for security reasons.</ref>
* Malware on {{workstation_product_name}} cannot bypass Tor, but it can ignore the VPN or proxy unless a separate Tunnel-Gateway is configured.
* It is not simple to configure VPNs, SSH or proxies in a foolproof, leak-free manner. However, in the case of {{project_name}} it is impossible for traffic to bybass Tor, even if the VPN or proxy is misconfigured. <ref>
If setting up a socksifier, proxy settings, transparent proxy with local redirection, SSH tunnel or a VPN in a leak-free manner were easy -- ensuring nothing will bypass the VPN, SSH or proxy -- then it would have been unnecessary to develop {{project_name}} in the first place.

The methods described in the tunnel documentation have all been tested to work. In the case of misconfiguration or leak bugs, the protections afforded by {{project_name}} and Tor still apply. This means the leak will still go through {{gateway_product_name}} and therefore be forced through Tor. The methods in the tunnel documentation are not as safe as a {{gateway_product_name}}. There were earlier development discussions and some progress (see [[Dev/Inspiration]]) towards chaining multiple Gateways (VPNBOX, JonDoBOX, I2PBOX, FreenetBOX and ProxyBOX), but nothing was finished due to the lack of community interest, support and developer input.</ref>
* Most of the pre-installed software on {{workstation_product_name}}, including [[Tor Browser]], is configured to take advantage of [[Stream Isolation]]. As a side effect, this software will ignore the VPN by default. It is necessary to reconfigure this software to disable stream isolation.
* When connecting to Tor before a tunnel link, the browser tab stream isolation feature of Tor Browser will be lost (or difficult to access). <ref>[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3455 Bug #3455: Tor Browser should set SOCKS username for a request based on referer]</ref> The reason is Tor Browser will not talk to Tor directly anymore, but will connect to the tunnel-link instead.
* When using a browser, connecting to Tor before a tunnel link worsens the [[Fingerprint#web_fingerprint|web fingerprint]]. The anonymity effects of using the configuration: <code>User</code> &rarr; (<code>Proxy / VPN / SSH</code> &rarr;) <code>Tor</code> &rarr; <code>Proxy / VPN / SSH</code> &rarr; <code>Tor Browser</code> &rarr; <code>Website</code> are unknown. This setup is so specialized that very few people are likely to configure it, reducing the Tor Browser user pool to a far smaller subset. Due to potential fingerprinting harm it is recommended against. 
* If proceeding despite the risk, the tunnel configuration should not be combined with any browser other than Tor Browser (like Firefox or Chrome). This would further exacerbate the browser fingerprinting risk. <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/vpn-after-whonix-inside-workstation-not-work-anymore-with-tbb/2153/5?u=patrick</ref>
