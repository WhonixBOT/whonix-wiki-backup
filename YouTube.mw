Watching YouTube Videos in {{project name}}
}}

{{stub}}

= Introduction =
YouTube Videos can be watched in [[Tor Browser]] or downloaded (for example by using the [[youtube-dl]] command line downloader, [[#Invidious|Invidious]] or YouTube video download sites) and then watched in VLC Media Player (pre-installed).

= Tor Browser =
Leave security slider at the lowest setting. Video playback might be dysfunctional at higher levels. Feel free to test as this might change over time.

Video playback might interrupt because [[Why is Tor slow|Tor is slow]], so called "buffering issues". To workaround that, it might help to stop video right after started for a while. This allows the video to "buffer", i.e. load enough of the upcoming video play back in advance to allow an uninterrupted viewing experience. Another workaround for buffering issues would be to download videos instead, playing these without need for any internet connection in VLC Media Player instead of watching these online on the YouTube website.

= Invidious =
Consider using [https://invidio.us/ invidious] ([https://github.com/iv-org/invidious project homepage]) which is an alternative front-end to YouTube, which is more lightweight than YouTube itself and comes with many features not possible on YouTube itself such as video download. It is also a good option to skip the YouTube nag screens for terms of service and login.

= MPV =
== Installation ==
You can install MPV video player to stream videos from Youtube or Invidious without enabling JavaScript.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt install mpv
}}

== Usage ==
When you found video you want to play copy URL and run

{{CodeSelect|code=
mpv your URL
}}

= Virtualizer Specific =
== VirtualBox ==
VirtualBox users note: Performance of videos might be slow. For a possible solution, see [[VirtualBox/Troubleshooting#Slow_Video_Playback|VirtualBox, Troubleshooting: Slow Video Playback]].

= Troubleshooting =
# "Forget" about {{Project name}} for a moment and imagine you had never heard of the platform. Test this using the virtualizer software (such as VirtualBox, KVM or Qubes) without {{project name}} being involved first.
# Try a VM other than {{Project name}} such as for example Debian <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}</code>.
# If that does not fix the issue, that means the root issue is not caused by {{project name}}. Therefore it is recommended to attempt to resolve the issue as per [[Free Support Principle]].
