= Introduction =
To watch YouTube videos anonymously, users have three options:
# Watching videos directly in [[Tor Browser]] via the YouTube or [[#Invidious|Invidious]] websites.
# Downloading videos -- for example via the [[youtube-dl]] command line downloader, [[#Invidious|Invidious]] or YouTube video download sites -- and then watching them in VLC Media Player (pre-installed).
# Using the YouTube URL to watch videos directly in MPV or VLC Media Player via the network streaming option.

= Tor Browser =
== YouTube Website ==

To watch videos directly on the YouTube website, leave the security slider at the lowest setting; video playback is usually dysfunctional at higher levels. Higher security settings might work at a later time, so readers are encouraged edit this page if the situation changes. In late 2020 it is common for YouTube to report 'suspicious network activity' when attempting to stream videos in Tor Browser (due to the detection of Tor exit nodes in use).

It is common to experience "buffering issues" (interrupted video playback) because [[Why is Tor slow|Tor is slow]]. A simple workaround is to pause the video when it first starts so it can "buffer". This allows enough of the upcoming video playback to load in advance for an uninterrupted viewing experience. Alternatively the videos can be downloaded instead and watched in a media application like VLC Media Player, rather than relying upon an online internet connection with the YouTube website.

== Invidious ==
It is strongly recommended to utilize [https://invidio.us/ Invidious] ([https://github.com/iv-org/invidious project homepage]) as an alternative front-end to YouTube. Note that at the time of writing, the primary invidio.us site presents with a message stating it has closed down as of 1 September, 2020. However a number of alternative instances are available and have been tested to work: 
<div style="column-count:3;-moz-column-count:3;-webkit-column-count:3">
* invidious.snopyta.org
* invidious.ggc-project.de
* invidious.13ad.de
* yewtu.be
* invidious.fdn.fr
* invidious.toot.koeln
* invidiou.site
* yt.iswleuven.be
* vid.mint.lgbt
* watch.nettohikari.com
</div>
Invidious is more lightweight than YouTube itself and comes with many additional features such as a video download option and onion addresses. Also, it does not present the user with login prompts or terms of service messages.

= MPV =
== Installation ==
You can install MPV video player to stream videos from Youtube or Invidious without enabling JavaScript.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt install mpv
}}

== Usage ==
When you found video you want to play copy URL and run

{{CodeSelect|code=
mpv your URL
}}

= Virtualizer Specific =
== VirtualBox ==
VirtualBox users note: Performance of videos might be slow. For a possible solution, see [[VirtualBox/Troubleshooting#Slow_Video_Playback|VirtualBox, Troubleshooting: Slow Video Playback]].

= Troubleshooting =
# "Forget" about {{Project name}} for a moment and imagine you had never heard of the platform. Test this using the virtualizer software (such as VirtualBox, KVM or Qubes) without {{project name}} being involved first.
# Try a VM other than {{Project name}} such as for example Debian <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}</code>.
# If that does not fix the issue, that means the root issue is not caused by {{project name}}. Therefore it is recommended to attempt to resolve the issue as per [[Free Support Principle]].
