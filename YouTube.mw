= Introduction =
YouTube Videos can be watched in [[Tor Browser]] or downloaded (for example by using the [[youtube-dl]] command line downloader or YouTube video download sites) and then watched in VLC Media Player.

= Tor Browser =
Leave security slider at the lowest setting. Video playback might be dysfunctional at higher levels. Feel free to test as this might change over time.

= Virtualizer Specific =
== VirtualBox ==
VirtualBox users note: Performance of videos might be slow. For a possible solution, see [[VirtualBox/Troubleshooting#Slow_Video_Playback|VirtualBox, Troubleshooting: Slow Video Playback]].

= Troubleshooting =
# "Forget" about {{Project name}} for a moment and imagine you had never heard of the platform. Test this using the virtualizer software (such as VirtualBox, KVM or Qubes) without {{project name}} being involved first.
# Try a VM other than {{Project name}} such as for example Debian <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}</code>.
# If that does not fix the issue, that means the root issue is not caused by {{project name}}. Therefore it is recommended to attempt to resolve the issue as per [[Free Support Principle]].
