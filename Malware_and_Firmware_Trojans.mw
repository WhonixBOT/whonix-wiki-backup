== Watering Hole Attacks ==

It should be noted that advanced malware can infect a user's computer via a [https://www.techopedia.com/definition/31858/watering-hole-attack Watering Hole Attack]. This vector has similarities to the software version of a [[Firmware_Security_and_Updates#Supply_Chain_Attacks|Supply Chain Attack]], and these methods are not mutually exclusive: <ref name=Watering_hole_attack>https://www.techopedia.com/definition/31858/watering-hole-attack</ref>

<blockquote>A watering hole attack is a malware attack in which the attacker observes the websites often visited by a victim or a particular group, and infects those sites with malware. A watering hole attack has the potential to infect the members of the targeted victim group. Although uncommon, a watering hole attack does pose a significant threat to websites, as these attacks are difficult to diagnose.</blockquote>

In the case of (Qubes-)Whonix users, any future attempt would logically target hosted content on GitHub, SourceForge, various forum locations,  mirrors, popular documentation links, and frequently visited security and anonymity sites like Tails, The Tor Project and so on. <ref>More commonly attacks favor banks, large organizations and government offices due to the obvious political and profit motives. In general, only intelligence entities would bother to attack users of popular anonymity software in this way.</ref> The hope is that developers, contributors and general users of the software become infected with stealthy malware that is immune to detection.

The attack involves a few steps: <ref name=Watering_hole_attack /> <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watering_hole_attack</ref>

# Zero-day or other vulnerabilties target the website software.
# Malicious JavaScript or HTML are most often used to inject malicious programming code.
# The code redirects visitors to a different site that serves "malvertisments" or malware masquerading as legitimate software.
# Once installed, the malware can infect various members of the targeted group.

It should be noted that advanced adversaries are capable of gaining knowledge about the behavioral patterns of target groups -- where they congregate, topics of research, related interests, and handle mapping of anonymous networks. This generic browsing and membership knowledge, along with observed security practices, greatly narrows the number of specific sites that need be targeted and the suitable attack mode. One way to mitigate this threat is to rigorously inspect websites for malicious code.
