= Wallet Security Considerations =
== General Security Considerations ==
Avoid mixing wallets for ETH long term storage with wallets used for DeFi or NFT.

[https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/infinite-approval Be aware of the security issue with unlimited and infinite token approval.]

== How does the industry, institutional ETH custodians secure their funds? ==

* full nodes vs light nodes: Running ETH full nodes.
* anonymity: No regard for Tor / anonymity.
* wallet security: Using smart contract based on chain multisig (public, source-available) such as Gnosis Safe or proprietary Threshold Signatures Scheme (TSS) wallets

[https://mobile.twitter.com/gnosispm/status/1298302244677451783 Gnosis Safe allegedly storing more than 1 billion $ USD.] Would require more research if that is so indeed. No mainstream sources have been found yet.

== smart contract based on chain multisig ==
Discouraged. [https://www.springworks.in/blog/parity-multi-sig-wallets-funds-frozen-explained/ Millions worth of ETH was and still is frozen in the parity multisig smartcontract.] More references under [[Cryptocurrency_Security_Threats#Smart_Contract_On_Chain_Multisig_vs_Threshold_Signature_Wallets|Smart Contract On Chain Multisig vs Threshold Signature Wallets]].

[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66068627/is-there-a-way-to-use-multisig-without-smart-contracts-on-ethereum Is there a way to use multisig without smart contracts on Ethereum?]

<blockquote>Ethereum does not support native [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_cryptosystem threshold wallets]. You need to use multisignature wallets like [https://gnosis-safe.io/ Gnosis Safe].</blockquote>

<blockquote>Gnosis Safe requires only one transaction per execution from the multisig wallet. Other communication happens off-chain. Thus your assumption "very expensive and slow, because it requires a lot of transactions." is incorrect.</blockquote>

== Threshold Signature Wallets ==
Great in theory. In practice, there are no known Freedom Software based implementations available.

Proprietary products are discouraged due to privacy issues. Presumably as for any corporation, they would want to setup a call with their customer, identify, onboard, want to know details about the operation, possibly upsale and vendor lock-in.

= Full vs Light Node =
== Full Node Advantages ==
Similar to [[Bitcoin Core]] / [[ElectrumX]], the whole blockchain gets downloaded and analyzed for the user's addresses/transactions locally on their own local computer.

== Light Node Advantages ==
Very, very much easier to use.

== Light Node Disadvantages ==
Similar to electrum Bitcoin wallet when using third-party servers. A bit less severe since a Bitcoin wallet contains multiple addresses but a Ethereum wallet contains only one address. Could use a Qubes Disposables for watch-only.

== Disk Space ==
Full Blockchain Validating Node disk space requirement more than 1 TB.

== Full Node Boxes ==
Difficult. There are ETH full node ready-made box one can buy.

* https://ava.do/
* https://medium.com/@JustinMLeroux/running-ethereum-full-nodes-a-guide-for-the-barely-motivated-a8a13e7a0d31

But these aren't optimized for anonymity / use with Tor. Any anonymity features wouldn't have Whonix leak-proof robustness since for them it would be a gimmick and not project focus.

One could consider to purchase such as box

== ETH vs Tor generally ==
Apparently the ETH developers are not prioritizing anonymity or Tor-anything even though it's supposedly uncensorable smart contracts.

Chaos issue tracker with nonsense lazy stale-bot that is closing issues which aren't fixed:

* https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/1855
* https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/17686

ETH peer discovery over Tor is difficult because it requires UDP:

== ETH full node on own remote server ==
High disk space requirements.

Personal experience by {{project name}} developer Patrick. Maintenance intensive, things keep breaking, broken blockchain synchronization, development team was highly unresponsive in fixing critical issues such as blockchain synchronization, sync bugs. See bug report [https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/14571 Unable to sync ethereum blockchain] which was opened in 2017. No Ethereum developer attempted to debug the issue by asking other users or otherwise acknowledged the issue which was then automatically closed by the stale bot.

== Full Node Conclusion ==
Looks very difficult and very messy.

== Pruning Mode ==

= Installation =

TODO: Investigate feasibility of MyCrypto v MyEthereumWallet v MetaMask in {{project_name}}

* https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ
* https://github.com/myetherwallet/
* https://github.com/MetaMask

= Wallets =
== Metamask ==
Metamask by ConsenSys.

Pros:

* Reputation.

Cons:

* No offline signing at time of writing.
* No desktop app.

Neutral:

* Stateful. Reset wallet feature often needed.

== MyCrypto ==
Pros:

* desktop app 

Cons:

* Stateless. Have to enter private keys over and over again.

== MyEtherWallet ==
Also called MEW. Very similar to MyCrypto.

Cons:

* No desktop app.
