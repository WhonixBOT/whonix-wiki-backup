= Wallets =
== General Security Considerations ==
Avoid mixing wallets for ETH long term storage with wallets used for DeFi or NFT.

[https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/infinite-approval Be aware of the security issue with unlimited and infinite token approval.]

== Smart Contract On Chain Multisig ==
[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66068627/is-there-a-way-to-use-multisig-without-smart-contracts-on-ethereum Is there a way to use multisig without smart contracts on Ethereum?]

<blockquote>Ethereum does not support native [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_cryptosystem threshold wallets]. You need to use multisignature wallets like [https://gnosis-safe.io/ Gnosis Safe].</blockquote>

<blockquote>Gnosis Safe requires only one transaction per execution from the multisig wallet. Other communication happens off-chain. Thus your assumption "very expensive and slow, because it requires a lot of transactions." is incorrect.</blockquote>

Discouraged. See [[Cryptocurrency_Security_Threats#Smart_Contract_On_Chain_Multisig_vs_Threshold_Signature_Wallets|Smart Contract On Chain Multisig vs Threshold Signature Wallets]].

== Metamask ==
Metamask by ConsenSys.

Pros:

* Reputation.

Cons:

* No offline signing at time of writing.
* No desktop app.

Neutral:

* Stateful. Reset wallet feature often needed.

== MyCrypto ==
Pros:

* desktop app 

Cons:

* Stateless. Have to enter private keys over and over again.

== MyEtherWallet ==
Also called MEW. Very similar to MyCrypto.

Cons:

* No desktop app.
