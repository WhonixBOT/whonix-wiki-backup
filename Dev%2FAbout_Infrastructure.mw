= Current Situation =
== Introduction ==
[[{{project name short}}:Privacy_policy|Whonix.org Site Security]]

This page talks about {{project name}} online hosting and (non-existing) testing infrastructure.

== File Hosting ==
Hosted on whonix.org, downloadable using TLS.

== Bug / Feature Request Tracker ==
https://phabrication.whonix.org.

(Works much better than github for a project at this scale.)

== Testing infrastructure ==
* CI build environment required.
* Automated Test Suite <ref>
Port [https://tails.boum.org/contribute/release_process/test/automated_tests/ Tails Test Suite] to {{project name}} or create a new one from scratch.
</ref> required.

= backend =
== {{project name}} homepage backend ==
=== mediawiki ===
* [[Dev/mediawiki|mediawiki, codeselect, select code, short / long / recommended / detailed buttons]]

=== mediawiki advantages ===

* community contribution friendly - flagged revisions - usable way to allow anonymous users to edit and to let admins review changes before these go live
* seo - plugins provide good OpenGraph meta tags and meta settings (description, images)
* wiki templates
* footnotes
* expand buttons
* footer
* mobile view
* mediawiki markup text file backups (but are not easily importable)
* [https://forums.whonix.org/t/short-and-detailed-buttons-in-the-wiki-html-help-wanted short and detailed buttons] (probably not unique to mediawiki)

=== mediawiki disadvantages ===
* does not look that great
** our mediawiki skin "strapping" looks better than usual mediawiki / wikipedia with the huge space wasting sidebar that does not have much useful content related to the wiki page being viewed
** still does not look great (but perhaps another [https://forums.whonix.org/t/mediawiki-skins mediawiki skin] could solve that)
** the table of contents at the top may not be great? Perhaps a table of contents on the left or right side (???) would be better?
** too much white spaces everywhere
* offline documentation not solved - https://forums.whonix.org/t/offline-documentation-discussion
* translations not solved
* data base is binary (mysql) (requires mysql data base)
** in other words: not flat file
** not easy "transparent" backups
** (Backup using git-mediawiki: https://github.com/WhonixBot/whonix-wiki-backup - that can probably not easily be restored.)
** (XML backup: https://github.com/WhonixBOT/WhonixWikiBackups)
** cannot rebuild from clean human readable source files

=== goals for new website ===
* git based?
* prose.io ([http://prose.io/#adrelanos/vpn-firewall/edit/master/README.md example]) compatible?
* breadcrumbs navigation?
* javascript free?
* CMS free?
* bootstrap based?

* mobile friendly!
* illustrative images!
* quick page load times!
* footer links (legal, imprint)!
* seo!
