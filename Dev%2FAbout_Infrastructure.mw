== Introduction ==
[[Privacy Policy Technical Details|{{project_name}}.org Site Security]]

This page talks about {{project name}} online hosting and (non-existing) testing infrastructure.

== File Hosting ==
Hosted by mirror, downloadable using TLS.

== Bug / Feature Request Tracker ==
https://phabricator.whonix.org.

(Works much better than github for a project at this scale.)

== Testing infrastructure ==
* CI build environment required.
* Automated Test Suite <ref>
Port [https://tails.boum.org/contribute/release_process/test/automated_tests/ Tails Test Suite] to {{project name}} or create a new one from scratch.
</ref> required.

= backend =
== mediawiki ==
* [[Dev/mediawiki|mediawiki, codeselect, select code, short / long / recommended / detailed buttons]]

=== mediawiki advantages ===

* community contribution friendly - flagged revisions - usable way to allow anonymous users to edit and to let admins review changes before these go live
* sufficient protection from spam
* seo - plugins provide good OpenGraph meta tags and meta settings (description, images)
* wiki templates
* footnotes
* expand buttons
* footer
* mobile view
* mediawiki markup text file backups (but are not easily importable)
* [https://forums.whonix.org/t/short-and-detailed-buttons-in-the-wiki-html-help-wanted short and detailed buttons] (probably not unique to mediawiki)

=== mediawiki disadvantages ===
* does not look that great
** our mediawiki skin "foreground" looks better than usual mediawiki / wikipedia with the huge space wasting sidebar that does not have much useful content related to the wiki page being viewed
** still does not look great (but perhaps another [https://forums.whonix.org/t/mediawiki-skins mediawiki skin] could solve that)
** the table of contents at the top may not be great? Perhaps a table of contents on the left or right side (???) would be better?
** too much white spaces everywhere
* offline documentation not solved - https://forums.whonix.org/t/offline-documentation-discussion
* translations not solved
* data base is binary (mysql) (requires mysql data base)
** in other words: not flat file
** not easy "transparent" backups
** (Backup using git-mediawiki: https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}Bot/whonix-wiki-backup - that can probably not easily be restored.)
** (XML backup: https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}BOT/{{project_name_short}}WikiBackups)
** cannot rebuild from clean human readable source files

=== goals for new website ===
* flat file
* git based?
* prose.io ([http://prose.io/#adrelanos/vpn-firewall/edit/master/README.md example]) compatible?
* breadcrumbs navigation?
* javascript free?
* CMS free?
* bootstrap based?

* mobile friendly
* illustrative images
* quick page load times
* footer links (legal, imprint)!
* seo

quote https://mytechiethoughts.com/linux/implementing-dane-with-certbot-using-lets-encrypt/

<blockquote>
The problem with regular Let’s Encrypt certificates

As you know, Let’s Encrypt certificates renew every 90 days. This is not a problem in itself, however, the standard procedure is to generate a new private key with each renewal and, thus, an entirely new public key also. This will necessarily change the hashed key value that would appear in our TLSA record meaning that we would have to remember to update our DNS records on each renewal otherwise the wrong key will be specified and no one will trust our site/server/application! We need to tell Let’s Encrypt to re-use our private key so that the public key hash value does NOT change – that way our DNS record remains valid across certificate renewals.
