= Current Situation =
== Introduction ==
[[Whonix:Privacy_policy|Whonix.org Site Security]]

This page talks about Whonix online hosting and (non-existing) testing infrastructure.

== File Hosting ==
Hosted on whonix.org, downloadable using TLS.

== Bug / Feature Request Tracker ==
https://phabrication.whonix.org.

(Works much better than github for a project at this scale.)

== Testing infrastructure ==
* CI build environment required.
* Automated Test Suite <ref>
Port [https://tails.boum.org/contribute/release_process/test/automated_tests/ Tails Test Suite] to Whonix or create a new one from scratch.
</ref> required.

= Old Criteria and Plan for Web Hosting =
== Requirements for Good Hosting ==
=== Requirements ===

* Some webspace and sufficient traffic.
* Needs a wiki, a forum, a blog, a mailing list.
* We can either use free project hosting or own hosting.
* Tor friendly.
* No tracking scripts. (Google analytics etc.)
* Permit to sign up and to use the page exclusively over Tor.
* A wiki on that site (media wiki). (And spoilers.) (And flagged revisions.)
* A free SSL certificate.
* All parts off the website reachable over SSL without any warnings.
** sourceforge.net does not offer that (SSL warnings).
** startssl.com offers free SSL certificates. You simply have to prove, that you have control over the domain - but that's not possible with subdomains.
* Hosting and domain.
** Censor resistant in sense of "Whonix will not get deleted."
** Free - if that is possible. No one is willing to pay and in the beginning there are no donations.
* We allow guest/anonymous postings (bug report, feedback, etc.) and moderate it very non-restrictive. (Allow any critique. Only delete off topic talk such as warez.)
** It's still desired to have the less critical parts of the wiki open for guest edits.
** Where no random trolls/crackers can modify anything important.
** A wiki where guest edits are allowed only works when having a feature for [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagged_revisions Flagged revisions] Sighted versions, where admins review changes and manually make the edited version the default visible page for everyone. To my knowledge, only mediawiki has such a feature.

=== Answered Questions ===

* Is there a free project hosting fulfilling all requirements?
** Last time checked, no.

== Ideal Hosting offers additionally... ==

* We better don't choose something based in non-free countries, such as US.
* Fully accessible by text mode browsers.
* Fully accessible without JavaScript.
* Optionally reachable by a hidden service.

= Reviewed Hosting Services =
== sourceforge.net ==
In past, all components of Whonix were hosted on sourceforge.net. Whonix still uses sourceforge.net as primary bulk file download service. Unfortunately, sourceforge does not provide direct download links (hotlinking).

The internal wiki, forum and the mailing list and download mirrors provided by sf.net provide unlimited traffic, which is very good.

The forum provided by sourceforge.net was not very well suited for Whonix. Most users are expected to post to the forums over Tor. sourceforge.net doesn't handle changing IP's very well. Registered users often had to post twice until their message got stored. And if they haven't stored their draft beforehand it was lost, which was really annoying. Positive points were, that the forum was viewable over SSL, but only for registered users. Let's say user's managed to successfully post a message, then it was still confusing because the message had to be manually moderated due to automatic spam scripts targeting Whonix forum. Sourceforges wiki was unfortunately not viewable over SSL, which was very bad.

sf.net generally provides two different categories of hosting. [http://sourceforge.net/p/allura/ Allura] with "some" SSL, i.e. the wiki, forum, mailing list, download mirrors on the other hand [http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/wiki/Project%20web%20and%20developer%20web%20platform project web].

Project web (no SSL) has somewhat low limited traffic, but according to their support will be manually increased.

One of the major issues with sf.net is, that is does not support SSL everywhere. In past, the [[Contribute]] page contained a [[Contribute#Vote Ideas|Vote]] chapter and one of the votes users are encouraged to, was [http://sourceforge.net/apps/ideatorrent/sourceforge/ideatorrent/idea/721/ Idea #721: Allow SSL for SourceForge pages whenever possible]. Unfortunately, very few users voted.

A very strong point for sf.net is, that big files (virtual machine images) and unlimited traffic are allowed. Another strong one of course is, that sf.net allows Whonix to be hosted on sf.net.

Sourceforge.net blocks users from "Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria".

Other severe usability bugs:

* [https://sourceforge.net/p/allura/tickets/5661/ Improve Support for Tor Browser; option to disable IP check]
* [https://sourceforge.net/p/allura/tickets/5662/ Prevent drafts from getting lost]
* [https://sourceforge.net/p/allura/tickets/6207/ Long content pages broken]

== Google Code ==
* Google Code blocks users from "Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria".
* [http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2013/05/a-change-to-google-code-download-service.html No file downloads.]

=== wikimedia / wikpedia ===
Last time we checked wikipedia (wikimedia) derivatives and wikia weren't Tor friendly.

== savannah ==
* https://savannah.nongnu.org (with SSL) looked promising and they are expected to be gone soon or to do any other stupid stuff (banning countries etc.).
* They offer homepages, for example http://www.nongnu.org/qwe/ but seems like there are no subdomains (qwe.nongnu.org) with SSL (for nongnu.org). That's the minimum requirement.
* Support direct download links (hotlinking).
* Can't provide file hosting for Whonix, because it would cause too much traffic. <ref>https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/savannah-hackers-public/2013-09/msg00015.html</ref>

== github ==
* Already using github as main git repository.
* github.com offers [https://github.com/blog/272-github-pages sub domains], but they are not reachable over SSL.
* github triggers [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7084 a] [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7265 scary], [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6253 error] message. After either many pages trigger that error so it doesn't matter any more or until this message gets fixed in Tor Browser, we shouldn't use the github as issue tracker or website to avoid FUD. When that got somehow a non-problem, we could think about using github as issue tracker.
* How autocreate table of contents using markdown on github? But...
* Github also [https://github.com/github/markup/ supports] mediawiki syntax.
** Seems it automatically creates a table of contents, good!
** Bug: [https://github.com/github/markup/issues/193 Mediawiki Pictures now shown in Github Wiki], unless this bug gets fixed, we could think about using the github source code hosting as website, see [https://github.com/adrelanos/testw/blob/master/README.mediawiki example].
** We haven't found out yet how to use \[\[include ref=WikiHeader\]\] for github mediawiki pages. It's an important feature for Whonix pages.
** Looks like mediawiki support is just a gimmick. More advanced formatting like font size, syntax highlighting and so on doesn't work.
* No file hosting service.

== gitorious ==
* Nice as a git mirror. [https://gitorious.org/whonix/whonix In use] as a git mirror.
* SSL for the whole page including the wiki.
* The wiki supports less features, no html (not that important) and no tables. The side bar takes too much space and leaves too less page for the wiki. The wiki is more suited for smaller documentation but not as a whole website replacement like Whonix needs.
* No file hosting service.

== self hosted hidden service ==
* Adrelanos is not willing to do it.

== free onion hosting service ==
* We could host a website on third party (free) hidden service webspace service.
* Risky, because those services can go away any time without notice. - Looks like a valid risk, two just went down. <ref>
* <s>[http://bj6sy3n7tbt3ot2f.onion OnionHosting] (DOWN)</s>
** <s>Price 5 BTC of "life time".</s>
** <s>Seems like it's a legit service. The Administrator is hosting many services in onionland for a long time. - Turns out this wasn't true</s>
** <s>We don't have 5 BTC to open an account. (Written long time before bitcoin skyrocketed.)</s>
* <s>[http://torhostg5s7pa2sn.onion/ torhost] (DOWN)</s>

* Can they handle the load when we release a new version? Not talking about bandwidth. Just about page views.
* Clearnet users could only access them through onion.to and tor2web.
** onion.to has a scary landing page.
** tor2web [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-February/027344.html does not yet appear in search engines]

== mirror.fsf.org ==
* http://mirror.fsf.org/
* Providing direct download links (hotlinking).
* Probably it will not be possible. They have a quite firm policy ([https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html Guidelines for Free System Distributions]) and if Debian didn't manage to fulfill it, surely Whonix can't either.
* In theory, an option could be to base Whonix on a distribution which is [https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html on their list already], but that might not be doable for technical reasons. (Questions open up, such as: Are they in sync with Debian unstable? Are they in sync with Debian testing? How long does it take until they deploy updates from security.debian.org? How up to date are their packages? How are they different from Debian?)
* Whonix contacted FSF to be their list. Thes declined, because Whonix is not standalone. (Does not fulfill point "Complete Distros", since physical isolation users have to install Debian first.)

== seul.org ==
* Sent registration request for seul.org. They don't accept new registrations, but Roger Dingledine (surprise, surprise) said in private mail, he's seeding Tails already and would volunteer to seed Whonix, if there was an announcement mailing list or if we mailed him new releases. Doing this.

== Conclusion ==
In summary there where no open source hosting sites, which offer SSL everywhere and unlimited download of big files. An open source hosting facility providing free webspace and SSL everywhere would be much desirable, but doesn't exist.

= Hosting Services to be reviewed =
== General Questions ==
* Download traffic?
* Quota?
* Direct download links (hotlinking) possible?
* Optional: SSL downloads?

== Mirror Providers ==
There are a few lists

* http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/wiki/Mirrors#MirrorProviders
* http://mirror.slitaz.org/mirrors
* http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/mirrors-rsync.html
* http://www.debian.org/distrib/archive

of mirror providers. We could contact them and ask if there were willing to provide direct download links (hotlinking) (+SSL) for Whonix.

When they are able to sponsor sourceforge, in comparison, sponsoring Whonix would be only peanuts to them. The question is, if they provide service for individual requests.

== codeplex ==
* Seem to offer direct download links. Just stored some random download links to see how long the direct link is valid.
* https://kinectmultipoint.codeplex.com/downloads/get/692328
* http://download-codeplex.sec.s-msft.com/Download/Release?ProjectName=kinectmultipoint&DownloadId=692328&FileTime=130174287196930000&Build=20602

== bitbucket ==
* Seem to offer direct download links. Just stored some random download links to see how long the direct link is valid.
* https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/downloads
* http://cdn.bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/downloads/pypy-2.1-beta1-arm-armhf-raspbian.tar.bz2

== autistici ==
https://vpn.autistici.org could be asked, if they were willing to act as webseed.

== alioth ==
http://alioth.debian.org could be asked, if they accepted Whonix as a new project, related enough to Debian, then they might be used as webseed.

== Asked ==
* http://linux.psu.ru/ linux at psu.ru
** November 2013: wants to test Whonix for a few months and then decide

* November 2013: mirror.aarnet.edu.au
** asked where their sourceforge folder is
** and if they tell us: asked if we may use them as master mirror for other mirrors

* November 2013: mirrorservice.org
** asked if we are allowed to directly download from them
** asked if we may use them as master mirror for other mirrors

Answer:

<pre>
We have no problem with you direct linking to us or you suggesting other
sites using us to mirror from (we offer rsync too).

But bear in mind that the data in that mirror is controlled by
SourceForge. They don't ship all files to all mirrors - each mirror
specifies how much data it can take, and they put stuff on up to that
limit based on popularity (presumably). Their delivery mechanism knows
which files are on which mirrors, so end users don't get pointed at a
mirror that doesn't contain the file they're after.

So it's possible that we may not have a complete copy of all your files,
and it may change in the future without any intervention from us.

If you're happy with that situation then go ahead and link to us.

Answer to follow up email:

<pre>
We don't have any upload facilities I'm afraid. We only offer downloads.

One solution is to run a private rsync server yourselves that only
certain mirrors can access. It doesn't have to be that quick.

You may find other mirrors do offer an upload facility though.

* November 2013: switch.ch
** asked for an upload account
** asked for master rsync capabilities

Answer:

<pre>
Dear Sir 

Thank you for your e-mail of 25th November 2013 regarding Whonix. 

Sorry, we are not interested in your offer.
