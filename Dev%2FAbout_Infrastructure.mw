}}
= Current Situation =
== Introduction ==
[[Whonix:Privacy_policy|Whonix.org Site Security]]

This page talks about Whonix online hosting and (non-existing) testing infrastructure.

== File Hosting ==
Hosted on whonix.org, downloadable using TLS.

== Bug / Feature Request Tracker ==
https://phabrication.whonix.org.

(Works much better than github for a project at this scale.)

== Testing infrastructure ==
* CI build environment required.
* Automated Test Suite <ref>
Port [https://tails.boum.org/contribute/release_process/test/automated_tests/ Tails Test Suite] to Whonix or create a new one from scratch.
</ref> required.

= Hosting Services to be reviewed =
== General Questions ==
* Download traffic?
* Quota?
* Direct download links (hotlinking) possible?
* Optional: SSL downloads?

== Mirror Providers ==
There are a few lists

* http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/wiki/Mirrors#MirrorProviders
* http://mirror.slitaz.org/mirrors
* http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/mirrors-rsync.html
* http://www.debian.org/distrib/archive

of mirror providers. We could contact them and ask if there were willing to provide direct download links (hotlinking) (+SSL) for Whonix.

When they are able to sponsor sourceforge, in comparison, sponsoring Whonix would be only peanuts to them. The question is, if they provide service for individual requests.

== codeplex ==
* Seem to offer direct download links. Just stored some random download links to see how long the direct link is valid.
* https://kinectmultipoint.codeplex.com/downloads/get/692328
* http://download-codeplex.sec.s-msft.com/Download/Release?ProjectName=kinectmultipoint&DownloadId=692328&FileTime=130174287196930000&Build=20602

== bitbucket ==
* Seem to offer direct download links. Just stored some random download links to see how long the direct link is valid.
* https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/downloads
* http://cdn.bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/downloads/pypy-2.1-beta1-arm-armhf-raspbian.tar.bz2

== autistici ==
https://vpn.autistici.org could be asked, if they were willing to act as webseed.

== alioth ==
http://alioth.debian.org could be asked, if they accepted Whonix as a new project, related enough to Debian, then they might be used as webseed.

== Asked ==
* http://linux.psu.ru/ linux at psu.ru
** November 2013: wants to test Whonix for a few months and then decide

* November 2013: mirror.aarnet.edu.au
** asked where their sourceforge folder is
** and if they tell us: asked if we may use them as master mirror for other mirrors

* November 2013: mirrorservice.org
** asked if we are allowed to directly download from them
** asked if we may use them as master mirror for other mirrors

Answer:

<pre>
We have no problem with you direct linking to us or you suggesting other
sites using us to mirror from (we offer rsync too).

But bear in mind that the data in that mirror is controlled by
SourceForge. They don't ship all files to all mirrors - each mirror
specifies how much data it can take, and they put stuff on up to that
limit based on popularity (presumably). Their delivery mechanism knows
which files are on which mirrors, so end users don't get pointed at a
mirror that doesn't contain the file they're after.

So it's possible that we may not have a complete copy of all your files,
and it may change in the future without any intervention from us.

If you're happy with that situation then go ahead and link to us.

Answer to follow up email:

<pre>
We don't have any upload facilities I'm afraid. We only offer downloads.

One solution is to run a private rsync server yourselves that only
certain mirrors can access. It doesn't have to be that quick.

You may find other mirrors do offer an upload facility though.

** asked for an upload account
** asked for master rsync capabilities

Answer:

<pre>
Dear Sir 

Thank you for your e-mail of 25th November 2013 regarding Whonix. 

Sorry, we are not interested in your offer.
