Multiple Whonix-Gateways can be used alongside multiple Whonix-Workstations, but this has both advantages and disadvantages. One security benefit is the isolation of separate Whonix-Gateway VM instances. In the event that one Whonix-Gateway is compromised, it is not certain the other(s) will be similarly compromised. On the downside, newly cloned Whonix-Gateway(s) will end up with a different set of Tor entry guards unless precautions are taken. <ref>Such as manually configuring identical Tor entry guards. Qube-Whonix users can [[Tor#Copy_Tor_Configuration_files_and_Settings_to_Another_sys-whonix_Instance|copy the Tor state folder to another <code>sys-whonix</code>]] instance or use the same [[Bridges]].</ref> <ref>At present, full instructions are not available for every Non-Qubes-Whonix platform.</ref> 

In this configuration ISPs are probably capable of detecting that two different Tor data folders are in use, but this is not necessarily an anonymity threat. Similarly, if multiple Tor Browsers are used with distinct Whonix-Gateways, then a different set of Tor entry guards will be used as well (unless by chance the same Tor guards are chosen for different Whonix-Gateways).

When multiple Whonix-Gateways are run in parallel, the risks explained in the [[Multiple_Whonix-Workstations#Safety_Precautions|Multiple Whonix-Workstations: Safety Precautions]] section equally apply.

== KVM ==

See [[KVM#Multiple_Whonix-Gateways|Multiple Whonix-Gateways]].

== VirtualBox ==
In this case, it is necessary to change the Whonix-Gateway network ''interface2'' and Whonix-Workstation network ''interface1'' from internal network <code>Whonix</code> to something else.

= Qubes-Whonix =

It is simple to create additional Whonix-Gateways (<code>sys-whonix</code> instances) in [[Qubes|Qubes-Whonix]]; see 
[[Qubes/Create_Gateway_ProxyVMs|Create Gateway ProxyVMs]].

The only requirement is that the newly created <code>sys-whonix</code> is based on the <code>{{whonix-gw}}</code> TemplateVM and has a <u>distinctive VM name</u>, so it is not confused with other VMs.
