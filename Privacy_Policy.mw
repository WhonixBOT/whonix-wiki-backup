{{name}} ("us", "we", or "our") operates the website {{name-website}} (the "Service").

This Privacy Policy document contains types of information that is collected and recorded by {{name}} and how we use it. This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.

<!--We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our enterprise. At {{name}}, accessible from {{name-website}}, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our visitors for the management of the {{name}}. The use of the Internet pages of the {{name}} is possible without any indication of personal data; however, if a data subject wants to use special enterprise services via our website, processing of personal data could become necessary.-->
If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject.

The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, email address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the {{name}}. <!--By means of this data protection declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.-->

<!--As the controller, the {{name}} has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website. However, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g. by telephone.-->

<!--We use your data to provide and improve the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our [[Terms of Service]].-->

<!--If you have additional questions or require more information about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us through email at {{name-email}}.-->

If you click on a link to a third party, you will be directed to that third party's site.

We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.
}}

== Information Collection And Use ==

We collect several different types of information for various purposes to provide and improve our Service to you.

=== Types of Data Collected ===

==== Personal Data ====
{{Privacypolicy/Left|content=
Examples of what personally identifiable information may include.
}}

{{Privacypolicy/Right
| arrow text =
Back to top 
| content =
We collect and process your personal data if you purchase certain products or services from {{name}}.

We also collect and process your personal data if you supply us with certain products or services and we need your data to complete the obligation.

While using our Service, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you ("Personal Data"). Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to:

{{Box|text=
* Email address
* First name and last name
* Phone number
* Address, State, Province, ZIP/Postal code, City
* avatar (graphical representation of the user) or photography
* Cookies and Usage Data
}}

Any information that falls outside of this is "non-personal information."

If we store your personal information with information that is non-personal, we will consider the combination as personal information. If we remove all personal information from a set of data then the remaining is non-personal information.
}}

==== Usage Data ====
{{Privacypolicy/Left|content=
We may also collect information on how our web services are accessed and used ("Usage Data").

Like other websites, we receive some information about you automatically when you visit the our Sites.

Examples of usage data.
}}

{{Privacypolicy/Right
| arrow text =
Back to top 
| content =
{{name}} follows a standard procedure of using log files. These files log visitors when they visit websites. Most if not all hosting companies do this and a part of hosting services' analytics.

This Usage Data may include:

{{Box|text=
<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">
* IP address of the requesting computer
* Name of the user’s internet access provider
* the website that referred you to our Service
* Cookies and Usage Data

For more examples please press on Expand on the right side.
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
* exit pages, the last page you view before leaving our Sites
* possibly the number of clicks
* the time and date of your visit
* Name and URL of the retrieved file
* the pages of our Service that you visit
* the time spent on those pages
* Amount of transmitted data
* Access status (file transfer, file not found, etc.)
* unique device identifiers
* diagnostic data
* Detection information for the browser and operating system such as
** browser type
** browser version
** your browser's language preference
* any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.
</div>
</div>
}}

The collection, processing, and use of this data are to:

* enable the use of the website, and
* deliver the content of our website correctly,
* customize content and set language preferences
* optimize the content of our website as well as its advertisement,
* improve performance,
* understand how users interact with our Sites,
* track and study use of various features,
* analyze trends,
* gain understanding about the demographics of our different Sites,
* ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and
* for system security and technical administration of the network infrastructure, fight vandalism
* test features to see what works
* provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. 

A comparison with other data or a transfer to third parties, even in excerpts, does not take place. We do not draw any conclusions about the data subject.

{{name}} usually stores data about how you use our Sites in identifiable form for just a few weeks. In special circumstances, like extended investigations about technical attacks, {{name}} may preserve log data longer, for analysis.

<!-- own -->
When usage data gets deleted which happens in most if not all cases automatically we will not notify any data subject of the deletion since:

* this would involve disproportionate effort or,
* may even be impossible,

because we cannot infer your contact information from usage data. Rather, we have no interest to infer your contact information from usage data for purposes of data minimization.
<!-- /own -->

{{name}} stores aggregate statistics about use of for as long as {{name}} hosts the website, but those statistics do not include data identifiable to you personally with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.

{{Box|text=
Legal basis for the collection of usage data is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), §6, 1, (f), the legitimate interest of the data controller.
}}
}}

{{Anchor|IP Addresses}}
{{Anchor|IP Addresses Logging Policy}}

==== IP Addresses and IP Addresses Logging Policy ====
{{Privacypolicy/Left|content=
We keep your IP address confidential whenever possible.

We disable IP logging whenever possible.
}}

{{Privacypolicy/Right
| arrow text =
Back to top 
| content =
When you visit any of our Sites, we automatically receive the IP address of the device (or your proxy server) you are using to access the Internet, which could be used to infer your geographical location. We keep IP addresses confidential, except as provided in this Policy. We don't infer your geographical location, except as provided in this Policy.

A web server is a computer program that answers the request of viewing this website. RAM means volatile memory. Web application means a program run by the web server responsible for showing content. Localhost means the very computer, the local computer where the program is running.

Whenever possible we disable IP logging in the web server which means that the IP address is only known to the web server while only being kept in RAM only to process the request by the web browser. It gets replaced to 127.0.0.1 before it gets forwarded to web applications. Since the IP address is set to a common shared value 127.0.0.1 for everyone and since 127.0.0.1 means localhost it is no longer personal data. No conclusions can be drawn from 127.0.0.1.

We reserve the right to enable IP logging in special circumstances which could include for example the case of technical attacks on {{name}} or for purposes required by law.

This policy is in place to minimize the amount of stored data. Historically this resulted in periods where IP addresses are effectively excluded from [[#Log Files]]. However, future periods with IP logging enabled cannot be predicted.
}}

==== Tracking and Cookies Data ====
{{Privacypolicy/Left|content=
<!--We use certain technologies to collect information about how you use our Sites.-->
<!--We use Cookies, JavaScript, Local Storage to improve our service.-->
<!--We also use a variety of commonly-used technologies, like cookies, to collect information regarding how you use the our Sites, make our services safer and easier to use, and to help create a better and more customizable experience for you.-->
Like most other websites, {{name}} uses 'cookies' to collect information regarding how you use the our Sites, make our services safer and easier to use, and to help create a better and more customizable experience for you.

We never used tracking technologies for advertising. We do not sell or rent the information collected.

<!-- A "tracking pixel" (sometimes called "web beacons", "transparent GIFs", "clear GIFs", Wpixel gifsW, or Wpixel tagsW) is a tiny, invisible image that allows us to track activities on our Sites or activities based on email notifications we send. Although tracking pixels are commonly associated with advertising, we never use tracking pixels for advertising nor do we sell or rent the information collected through tracking pixels. Information collected through tracking pixels can only be shared with third parties in aggregated form and in accordance with the Privacy Policy. Tracking pixels help us figure out if certain features, notifications, and products are effective and if they can be improved. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_beacon Learn more on Wikipedia]. -->
<!--"JavaScript" is a standard software programming language used on most modern websites. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript Learn more on Wikipedia.]-->
<!--"Local Storage" (also known as "Web Storage") is a way for a website to collect and store information "locally" (i.e. on the user's device rather than on the website’s server) and then later retrieve it again. For example, by using LocalStorage, a user’s visits can be stored on their own computer, counted, and then given to us. This allow us to receive important use statistics (the count of visits), while the specific information about when each individual visit occurred would never be transmitted to us.-->
<!--We actively collect some types of information with a variety of commonly-used technologies. These generally include, JavaScript, and a variety of "locally stored data" technologies, such as cookies and local storage. We realize that some of these technologies do not have the best reputation in town and can be used for less-than-noble purposes. So we want to be as clear as we can about why we use these methods and the type of information we collect with them.-->
<!--Depending on which technology we use, locally stored data can be anything from text, pictures, and whole articles (as we explain further below) to Personal Information (like your IP address) and information about your use of our Sites (like your username or the time of your visit).-->
<!--Tracking technologies also used are beacons, tags, and scripts to collect and track information and to improve and analyze our Service.-->

Cookies are text files that are stored in a computer system via an Internet browser. Cookies are files with small amount of data which may include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a website and stored on your device.

Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the data subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.

Through the use of cookies, the {{name}} can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.

Examples of Cookies we use:

* Preference Cookies: We use Preference Cookies to remember your preferences and various settings such as your language preference.
* Performance and Analysis: These cookies collect information about how you use our website, so that we can better understand how the website works and improve it for you and other users.
* Session Cookies: We use Session Cookies to operate our Service.
* Security Cookies: We use Security Cookies for security purposes.
* Functionality: These cookies help the our Sites work, including essential features like user sign-in and authentication so you can bypass entering your passwords on our website for example if you choose the "remember me" option during login.
* Third-Party: These cookies allow us to render services provided by third parties, such as "like" and "share" buttons. When a third party provides these kinds of services, they may require the use of a cookie in order to provide their services. These would only be used with your affirmative consent.
** If you ever come across a third party data collection tool that has not been authorized by you (such as one that may have been mistakenly placed by another user or administrator), please report it to us at {{name-email}}.
<!--* Deliver more relevant content to you faster. For example, we use local storage to store your most recently read articles directly on your device, so they can be retrieved quickly. Also, we use cookies to learn about the topics searched so that we can optimize the search results we deliver to you.-->
<!--* Understand how you use our Sites, so that we know what works and what is useful. For example, we might use cookies to learn about the list of articles you are following on your watchlist so that we can recommend similar articles that you may be interested in.-->
<!--* Understand how you use the our Sites across different devices, so that we can make our varied Sites more efficient and effective for you.-->

Want to create an account? Great! Don't want to create an account? No problem!

You are not required to create an account to read or contribute to our Sites, except under rare circumstances. However, if you contribute without signing in, your contribution might be publicly attributed to the IP address associated with your device. 

By registering on the website of the controller,

* the IP address-assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data subject,
* date, and
* time of the registration

are also stored.

<!-- specific -->
The stored IP address may be anonymized as explained in chapter [[#IP Addresses]].

The storage of this data takes place against the background that this is the only way to prevent the misuse of our services, and, if necessary, to make it possible to investigate committed offenses. Insofar, the storage of this data is necessary to secure the controller. This data is not passed on to third parties unless there is a statutory obligation to pass on the data, or if the transfer serves the aim of criminal prosecution.

The registration of the data subject, with the voluntary indication of personal data, is intended to enable the controller to offer the data subject contents or services that may only be offered to registered users due to the nature of the matter in question. Registered persons are free to change the personal data specified during the registration at any time.

{{Box|text=

==== Usernames ====
{{Privacypolicy/Left|content=
Your username will be publicly visible, so please be careful about using your real name as your username. You can choose a pseudonym as your username if you wish.

No other personal information is required: no name, no date of birth, no credit card information.

Your password is only used to verify that the account is yours. Your IP address is also automatically submitted to us, and we might record it temporarily to help prevent abuse.

Once created, user accounts cannot be removed entirely (although you can usually hide the information on your user page if you choose to). This is because your public contributions must be associated with their author (you!).

===== Third Party Account Information =====
{{Privacypolicy/Left|content=
If you choose to link your account to certain third-party accounts on services such as GitHub, Google or Facebook (each, a "Third-Party Account"), you may be prompted to grant us access to certain personal information, such as your username and avatar or photo. We receive the information you agree to provide. We don't receive or store passwords for any of your Third-Party Accounts.

This information is used to authenticate your identity, and to simplify the account registration process by prefilling some of the fields.

===== Forums =====
{{Privacypolicy/Left|content=
Our forums make automated decisions determining if a post contains spam.

{{Privacypolicy/Right

The forums by {{name}} require an account to post and reply to topics.

To sign up for a forum account, the forum software requires a username, and an email address.

{{name}} uses your account data to identify you on the forum, and to create pages specific to you, like your profile page. If the forum is public, {{name}} publishes your account data. If the forum is access-restricted, {{name}} makes your account data available to everyone who can access the forum, according to the forum administrator’s configuration.

{{name}} uses your email address to:

* notify you about posts and other activity on the forum
* reset your password and help keep your account secure
* contact you in special circumstances related to your account
* contact you about legal requests, like DMCA takedown requests

You may provide additional data for your account, like a short biography, your location, your birthday or an avatar (graphical representation of the user) or photography on the profile settings page for your account. {{name}} makes that data available to others who can access the forum. You don’t have to provide this additional information, and you can erase it at any time.

{{name}} stores your account data as long as your account remains open.

{{name}} collects data about posts and other activity on the forum.

{{name}} collects the content of your posts, plus data about bookmarks, likes, and links you follow in order to share that data with others, through the forum. If the forum is public, {{name}} publishes your activity. If the forum is access-restricted, or access restrictions apply to the specific post, {{name}} makes your activity available only to users permitted to see it.

<!-- SPECIFIC -->{{name}} also collects data about private messages that you send through the forum. {{name}} makes private messages available to senders and their recipients, and also to forum administrators.  Since the private message function has always been disabled by {{name}}, you cannot write private messages through the forums.

{{name}} stores your posts and other activity as long as your account remains open.

You can make choices about how data about you is used on the settings page for your account. When a forum uses access restrictions that vary by category, you can choose who will see your post by choosing the appropriate category.

You can see your account data at any time by visiting your account page on the forum. Your account page also lists your posts and other activity on the forum.

'''Where can I access data about me?'''

Your account activity page also includes a link to download all of your activity in standard [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values comma-separated values] format.

'''How can I change or erase data about me?'''

You can change your account data at any time by visiting the profile settings page for your account. The settings for a particular forum may also allow you to close your account, on the settings page for your account. Closing your account starts a process of erasing or anonymizing {{name}}’s records of data you provided for your account. Forum administrators can also erase and anonymize accounts.

You are also able to edit, anonymize, or erase your posts. When you edit posts, {{name}} will keep all versions of your posts. Forum administrators can view old versions of posts, and optionally make them visible to other forum visitors.

{{Anchor|automated_forum}}
'''Does the forum make automated decisions based on data about me?'''

{{name}} uses data about your posts and other activity on many forums to make automated decisions about whether your posts to the forums that {{name}} hosts are spam. When the forum software decides that a post is likely spam, the forum refuses to accept the post.

If you think a post has been wrongly blocked or removed, contact an administrator of your forum. They can override the decision that a post was spam.

'''{{name}} uses data about posts and activity to set trust levels automatically.'''

The forum may use data about your posts and activity to award you badges and calculate a trust level for your account. Your trust level may affect how you can participate in the forum, such as whether you can upload images, as well as give you access to moderation and management powers in the forum. Your trust level therefore reflects forum administrators’ confidence in you, and their willingness to delegate community management functions, like moderation.

If you think your trust level has been set incorrectly, contact an administrator of your forum. They can manually adjust the trust level of your account.
}}

===== Wiki =====
{{Privacypolicy/Left|content=
Information on how the wiki can be used with as little information provided by you as possible.

You do not need to create an account to use our wiki.

If you do create an account, you do not need to give us your name or email address.

If you do not create an account, your contributions may not be attributed.

You may:

* Read all public wiki pages without registering an account.
* Register for an account without providing an email address or real name.
* In many cases even suggest modifications (edit) wiki pages. Those wiki pages closed to edits without account have been limited due to vandalism or high risk of vandalism.

"contributions" means content you add or changes you make to any of our Sites.

If you want to create a standard account, in most cases we require only a username and a password.

As per a mediawiki default feature, the wiki user settings allow to optionally choose your gender. It defaults to gender neutral. The user could change its gender setting but this is neither required nor desired. The user is recommended to leave this setting as is.

Anyone with Internet access (and not otherwise restricted from doing so) may edit the publicly editable pages of these sites with or without logging in as a registered user. By doing this, editors create a published document, and a public record of every word added, subtracted, or changed. This is a public act, and editors are identified publicly as the author of such changes. All contributions made to our Sites, and all publicly available information about those contributions, are irrevocably licensed according to our [[Terms of Service]].

Whatever you post on our Sites can be seen and used by everyone.

When you make a contribution to any of our Site, including on user or discussion pages, you are creating a permanent, public record of every piece of content added, removed, or altered by you. The page history will show:

* when your contribution or deletion was made, as well as
* your username (if you are signed in)

We may use your public contributions, either aggregated with the public contributions of others or individually, to create new features or data-related products for you or to learn more about how the Sites are used.

User contributions are aggregated according to their registration and login status. Data on user contributions, such as the times at which users edited and the number of edits they have made, are publicly available via user contributions lists, and in aggregated forms published by other users.

When you submit data in this manner it is associated with our website, not your personal account, and deleting your account does not delete this information.

Removing text from a page does not permanently delete it. Anyone can look at a previous version of an procedure and see what was there. Even if a page is "deleted", a user entrusted with higher level of access may still see what was removed from public view.
}}

==== Subscription to our newsletters ====
{{Privacypolicy/Left|content=
Subscription to our newsletter is volunteer. There are no positive or positive or negative consequences arising from subscription or unsubscription to our newsletter.

The personal data collected as part of a registration for the newsletter will only be used to send our newsletter.

The subscription to our newsletter may be terminated by the data subject at any time.

The consent to the storage of personal data, which the data subject has given for shipping the newsletter, may be revoked at any time.
}}

{{Privacypolicy/Right
| arrow text =

| content =
On the website of the {{name}}, users are given the opportunity to subscribe to our enterprise's newsletter. The input mask used for this purpose determines what personal data are transmitted, as well as when the newsletter is ordered from the controller.

The {{name}} informs its customers and business partners regularly by means of a newsletter about enterprise offers. The enterprise's newsletter may only be received by the data subject if (1) the data subject has a valid email address and (2) the data subject registers for the newsletter shipping. A confirmation email will be sent to the email address registered by a data subject for the first time for newsletter shipping, for legal reasons, in the double opt-in procedure. This confirmation email is used to prove whether the owner of the email address as the data subject is authorized to receive the newsletter.

During the registration for the newsletter, we might also store the IP address of the computer system assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data subject at the time of the registration. We will as well store the date and time of the registration. The collection of this data is necessary in order to understand the (possible) misuse of the email address of a data subject at a later date, and it therefore serves the aim of the legal protection of the controller.

The personal data collected as part of a registration for the newsletter will only be used to send our newsletter. In addition, subscribers to the newsletter may be informed by email, as long as this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or a registration in question, as this could be the case in the event of modifications to the newsletter offer, or in the event of a change in technical circumstances. There will be no transfer of personal data collected by the newsletter service to third parties.

{{Box|text=
Legal basis for the storage of account data is the:

* General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), §6, 1, (f), the legitimate interest of the data controller.
* General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), §6, 1, (a), the consent of the data subject
}}

{{Box|text=
right to revoke consent

The subscription to our newsletter may be terminated by the data subject at any time. 

The consent to the storage of personal data, which the data subject has given for shipping the newsletter, may be revoked at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

For the purpose of revocation of consent, a corresponding link is found in each newsletter. It is also possible to unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time directly on the website of the controller, or to communicate this to the controller in a different way.

==== Newsletter-Tracking ====
{{Privacypolicy/Left|content=
We may learn when you open our newsletter and which links you click.
}}

{{Privacypolicy/Right
| arrow text =
Back to top 
| content =
The newsletter of the {{name}} contains so-called tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic embedded in such emails, which are sent in HTML format to enable log file recording and analysis. This allows a statistical analysis of the success or failure of online marketing campaigns. Based on the embedded tracking pixel, the {{name}} may see if and when an email was opened by a data subject, and which links in the email were called up by data subjects.

Such personal data collected in the tracking pixels contained in the newsletters are stored and analyzed by the controller in order to optimize the shipping of the newsletter, as well as to adapt the content of future newsletters even better to the interests of the data subject. These personal data will not be passed on to third parties. Data subjects are at any time entitled to revoke the respective separate declaration of consent issued by means of the double-opt-in procedure. After a revocation, these personal data will be deleted by the controller. The {{name}} automatically regards a withdrawal from the receipt of the newsletter as a revocation.
}}

==== Contact via website or electronic mail (email) ====
{{Privacypolicy/Left|content=
If you contact us via contact form or email, there is no transfer of this personal data to third parties.

The website of the {{name}} contains information that enables a quick electronic contact form to our enterprise, as well as direct communication with us, which also includes a general address of the so-called electronic mail (email address). If a data subject contacts the controller by email or via a contact form, the personal data transmitted by the data subject are automatically stored. Such personal data transmitted on a voluntary basis by a data subject to the data controller are stored for the purpose of processing or contacting the data subject.

{{Box|text=
Legal basis for the storage of account data is the:

* General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), §6, 1, (f), the legitimate interest of the data controller.
* General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), §6, 1, (a), the consent of the data subject.
* General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), §6, 1, (b), the performance of a contract.

==== Comments function ====
{{Privacypolicy/Left|content=
Your comments posted using the comment function contain personal information (such as your username) and are visible to the public.
}}

{{Privacypolicy/Right
| arrow text =
Back to top 
| content =
The {{name}} offers users the possibility to leave individual comments on the website of the controller like on a blog. A blog is a web-based, publicly-accessible portal, through which one or more people called bloggers or web-bloggers may post articles or write down thoughts in so-called blogposts. Blogposts may usually be commented by third parties.

If a data subject leaves a comment on the website, the comments made by the data subject are also stored and published, as well as information on the date of the commentary and on the user's (pseudonym) chosen by the data subject. In addition, the IP address assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) to the data subject might also be logged. This storage of the IP address takes place for security reasons, and in case the data subject violates the rights of third parties, or posts illegal content through a given comment. The storage of these personal data is, therefore, in the own interest of the data controller, so that he can exculpate in the event of an infringement. This collected personal data will not be passed to third parties, unless such a transfer is required by law or serves the aim of the defense of the data controller.
}}

==== Subscription to comments ====
{{Privacypolicy/Left|content=
If you subscribe to comments you consent that you will receive notifications by email.

The consent can be withdrawn any time resulting in an unsubscription to the comments.

The comments made on the website or blog of the {{name}} may be subscribed to by third parties. In particular, there is the possibility that a commenter subscribes to the comments following his comments on a particular page.

If a data subject decides to subscribe to the option, the controller will send an automatic confirmation email to check the double opt-in procedure as to whether the owner of the specified email address decided in favor of this option. The option to subscribe to comments may be terminated at any time.

=== Transfer Of Data ===
{{Privacypolicy/Left|content=
Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to - and maintained on - computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from your jurisdiction.

Some data may be passed on, under strict contractual and legal requirements, to external service providers for processing.

{{name}} may transfer your personal data to other {{name}} affiliates for the purpose of carrying out a business relationship/transaction  with you or preserving our legitimate interests.

The European Commission has the power to determine whether a country outside the EU offers an adequate level of data protection, called an "adequacy decision" by the European Commission. We may transfer your data to third-party countries outside of EU, where there has not been an adequacy decision made by the European Commission.

{{name}} will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and that no transfer of your Personal Data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of your data and other personal information.

Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.
}}

=== Sharing Of Data ===
{{Privacypolicy/Left|content=

When do we share your information with others?

* When we have asked and received your permission to share it.
** We share your information for a particular purpose, if you agree.
* For processing or providing products and services to you, but only if those entities receiving your information are contractually obligated to handle the data in ways that are approved by {{name}}.
** As hard as we may try, we can't do it all. So sometimes we use third-party service providers or contractors who help run or improve our Sites for you and other users. We give access to your Personal Information to these providers or contractors as needed to perform their services for us or to use their tools and services. We put requirements, such as data processing agreements, in place to help ensure that these service providers treat your information consistently with, and no less protective of your privacy than, the principles of this Privacy Policy.
* When we believe it is necessary to prevent harm to you or someone else. We will only share your information in this way if we have a good faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of you, our other users, {{name}} or the public.
* In case You Made It Public:
** Any information you post publicly on our Sites is just that – public. For example, if you put your mailing address on your talk page, that is public, and not protected by this Privacy Policy. And if you edit without registering or logging into your account, your IP address may be seen publicly. Please think carefully about your desired level of anonymity before you disclose Personal Information on your user page or elsewhere. 
** This was also already mentioned earlier in chapters [[#Your Public Contributions]], [[#Publicly Visible Information]] and [[#Public Logs]].
* See also [[#Disclosure Of Data]] below.

Under certain circumstances, {{name}} may be required to disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).

When we receive requests like this, we'll only release your personal information if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so.

We are committed to protecting your personal information once we receive it, from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We implement physical, commercial and technical security measures. Despite our efforts, if we learn of a security breach, we'll notify you so that you can take appropriate protective steps.

The security of your data is important to us, but unfortunately, there's no such thing as completely secure data transmission or storage, so we can't guarantee that our security will not be breached (by technical measures or through violation of our policies and procedures).

Measures we take include for example access control procedures, network firewalls, physical security and varying levels of encryption.

We will never ask for your password by email (but may send you a temporary password via email if you have requested a password reset). If you ever receive an email that requests your password, please let us know by sending it to {{name-email}}, so we can investigate the source of the email.
}}

== Legal Basis for Data Collection and Processing ==
{{Privacypolicy/Left|content=
{{name}} legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy Policy depends on the Personal Information we collect and the specific context in which we collect the information:

* {{name}} needs to perform a contract (obligation) with you
* You have given {{name}} permission to do so

Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services. Is our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data. Such processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).

After expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract.

{{name}} will also retain [[#Usage Data]] for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of our Service, or we are legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods.

Routine erasure and blocking of personal data

The data controller shall process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted by the European legislator or other legislators in laws or regulations to which the controller is subject to.

If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed by the European legislator or another competent legislator expires, the personal data are routinely blocked or erased in accordance with legal requirements.

{{Privacypolicy/Left|content=
The data controller shall collect and process the personal data of applicants for the purpose of the processing of the application procedure.
}}

{{Privacypolicy/Right
| arrow text =
Back to top 
| content =
The processing may also be carried out electronically. This is the case, in particular, if an applicant submits corresponding application documents by email or by means of a web form on the website to the controller. If the data controller concludes an employment contract with an applicant, the submitted data will be stored for the purpose of processing the employment relationship in compliance with legal requirements. If no employment contract is concluded with the applicant by the controller, the application documents shall be automatically erased two months after notification of the refusal decision, provided that no other legitimate interests of the controller are opposed to the erasure. Other legitimate interest in this relation is, e.g. a burden of proof in a procedure under the General Equal Treatment Act (AGG).

{{Box|text=

Many blockchains are open to forensic analysis which can lead to deanonymization and the unintentional revelation of private financial information, especially when blockchain data is combined with other data.
