* Did you know, that using non-anonymous activity in one browser and anonymous activity in another browser at the same time might get you deanonymized? We [[DoNot#Do_not_use_clearnet_and_Tor_at_the_same_time.|documented that]] and [[DoNot|lots of]] other [[Warning|stuff]].
* Reporting issues at other projects, such as:
** [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/created_by/adrelanos Qubes]
* The Tor Project
* troubadour: https://github.com/troubadoour?tab=repositories
* Thinking hard about obscure attacks on anonymity such as clock correlation deanonymization attacks. See [[Dev/TimeSync]].
* Keep the overview in the anonymity and privacy field, not focus too much into unimportant details, understand issues regular users are having.
* Successfully communicate issues in the Tor ecosystem and do so whenever we find something. Some suggestions have been implemented, others at least accepted.
