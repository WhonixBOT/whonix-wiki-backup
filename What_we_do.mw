}}



== Innovate ==

* Thinking hard about obscure attacks on anonymity such as clock correlation deanonymization attacks and develop countermeasures. See [[Dev/TimeSync]].
* Add support for multiple anonymity networks to cater to different user bases.
* Invent mechanisms for rapid Debian packaging.
** [https://github.com/Whonix/genmkfile genmkfile] - easy and turbo packaging of scripts and config files
** Demonstrating how to hassle free write man pages.
*** Example... (Using this for all related Whonix packages.)
*** Written in markdown.
*** Just 3 lines of packaging required.
*** https://github.com/Whonix/tor-ctrl/blob/master/man/tor-ctrl.8.ronn
**** https://github.com/Whonix/tor-ctrl/blob/a12d73ed01068baf32db067811c208034ced87fd/debian/control#L9
**** https://github.com/Whonix/tor-ctrl/blob/1c326b232b1f328a6542ae51f3f3afa3e1e44a55/debian/rules#L17-L18
* Focus on the anonymity and privacy field, not getting into unimportant details. Understand issues regular users are having and create a better UX.
* Develop Concepts:
** [[Dev/Permanent Takedown Attack Defender|Permanent Takedown Attack Defender, proposal to defend a permanent takedown threat]]
** [[Dev/apt-revoker|apt-revoker Check for Revocation Certificates before running apt-get]]
** [https://www.whonix.org/pipermail/whonix-devel/2019-January/001293.html package manager update security on/off switch]

== Cooperate ==

* Reporting issues at other projects, such as:
** [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/created_by/adrelanos Qubes]
* The Tor Project
* Successfully communicate issues in the Tor ecosystem and do so whenever we find something. Some suggestions have been implemented and others accepted.
** https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?reporter=proper&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&col=component&order=priority
** https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?reporter=adrelanos&col=id&col=summary&col=type&col=status&col=priority&col=milestone&col=component&order=priority
* Reported a number of security/privacy/anonymity issues some of them which could lead to deanonymization.

* https://secure-os.org/pipermail/desktops/
* Coordinate an active developer community [[Authorship#Current_Maintainers|Whonix team]].
* troubadour: https://github.com/troubadoour?tab=repositories
* Flexible packaging to allow cherry-picking of functionality by privacy and non-privacy distros alike: https://github.com/Whonix/anon-meta-packages/blob/master/debian/control
* providing all of Whonix improvements to Debian as reusable (by others) packages split by functionality: https://github.com/Whonix
* Timely review and merging of contributions.

== Educate ==

* Did you know, that using non-anonymous activity in one browser and anonymous activity in another browser at the same time might get you deanonymized? We [[DoNot#Do_not_use_clearnet_and_Tor_at_the_same_time.|documented that]] and [[DoNot|lots of]] other [[Warning|stuff]].
* answers are seldom disputed: http://tor.stackexchange.com/users/80/adrelanos?tab=answers
* Run a [https://forums.whonix.org/ community], doing user support.
* Extensive [[Documentation]] covering technical aspects and operational security.

== Maintenance ==

* Follow developments in anonymity, security and privacy, such as [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Operating_System_Software_and_Updates#apt_security_update_-_DSA_4371-1 this apt bug], post a [https://forums.whonix.org/t/special-instructions-required-to-securely-update-because-of-apt-security-update-dsa-4371-1/6721 news], develop [[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates#apt_security_update_-_DSA_4371-1|instructions]].
* Maintain various [[Contribute#Maintainer_List|components]].
* Development. See this [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/commits/master <u>subset</u> list of Whonix git commits].
* [https://github.com/Whonix >100 Whonix source code repositories].
* Keep whonix.org server safe and up to date with various webapps (website, wiki, forums, issue tracker).
* Test new packages.
* Call for, review feedback by, and process feedback by testers.
* Create [[Download|downloadable]] Whonix builds.
