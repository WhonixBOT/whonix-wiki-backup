== Innovate ==

* Thinking hard about obscure attacks on anonymity such as clock correlation deanonymization attacks and develop countermeasures. See [[Dev/TimeSync]].
* Add support for multiple anonymity networks to cater to different user bases.
* Invent mechanisms for rapid Debian packaging.
** [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/genmkfile genmkfile] - easy and turbo packaging of scripts and config files
** Demonstrating how to hassle free write man pages.
*** Example... (Using this for all related {{project_name}} packages.)
*** Written in markdown.
*** Just 3 lines of packaging required.
*** https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/tor-ctrl/blob/master/man/tor-ctrl.8.ronn
**** https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/tor-ctrl/blob/a12d73ed01068baf32db067811c208034ced87fd/debian/control#L9
**** https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/tor-ctrl/blob/1c326b232b1f328a6542ae51f3f3afa3e1e44a55/debian/rules#L17-L18
* Focus on the anonymity and privacy field, not getting into unimportant details. Understand issues regular users are having and create a better UX.
* Develop Concepts:
** [[Dev/project-news|Emergency Security News Notification]]
** [[Dev/Permanent Takedown Attack Defender|Permanent Takedown Attack Defender, proposal to defend a permanent takedown threat]]
** [[Dev/apt-revoker|apt-revoker Check for Revocation Certificates before running apt-get]]
** [https://www.whonix.org/pipermail/whonix-devel/2019-January/001293.html package manager update security on/off switch]
** And much more.
* General security interest, scrutiny, and connecting people. <ref>

== Cooperate ==

* Reporting issues at other projects, such as:
** [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/created_by/adrelanos Qubes]
** [https://www.virtualbox.org/query?status=%21closed&reporter=adrelanos VirtualBox]
* The Tor Project
* Successfully communicate issues in the Tor ecosystem and do so whenever we find something. Some suggestions have been implemented and others accepted.
** https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?reporter=proper&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&col=component&order=priority
** https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?reporter=adrelanos&col=id&col=summary&col=type&col=status&col=priority&col=milestone&col=component&order=priority
* Reported a number of security/privacy/anonymity issues some of them which could lead to deanonymization.
