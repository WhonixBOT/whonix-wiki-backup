}}



== Innovate ==

* Thinking hard about obscure attacks on anonymity such as clock correlation deanonymization attacks and develop countermeasures. See [[Dev/TimeSync]].
* Add support for multiple anonymity networks to cater to different user bases.
* Invent mechanisms for rapid Debian packaging.
** [https://github.com/Whonix/genmkfile genmkfile] - easy and turbo packaging of scripts and config files
** Demonstrating how to hassle free write man pages.
*** Example... (Using this for all related Whonix packages.)
*** Written in markdown.
*** Just 3 lines of packaging required.
*** https://github.com/Whonix/tor-ctrl/blob/master/man/tor-ctrl.8.ronn
**** https://github.com/Whonix/tor-ctrl/blob/a12d73ed01068baf32db067811c208034ced87fd/debian/control#L9
**** https://github.com/Whonix/tor-ctrl/blob/1c326b232b1f328a6542ae51f3f3afa3e1e44a55/debian/rules#L17-L18
* Focus on the anonymity and privacy field, not getting into unimportant details. Understand issues regular users are having and create a better UX.

== Cooperate ==

* Reporting issues at other projects, such as:
** [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/created_by/adrelanos Qubes]
* The Tor Project
* Successfully communicate issues in the Tor ecosystem and do so whenever we find something. Some suggestions have been implemented and others accepted.

** https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?reporter=adrelanos&col=id&col=summary&col=type&col=status&col=priority&col=milestone&col=component&order=priority
* Reported a number of security/privacy/anonymity issues some of them which could lead to deanonymization.

* Coordinate an active developer community [[Authorship#Current_Maintainers|Whonix team]].
* troubadour: https://github.com/troubadoour?tab=repositories
* Flexible packaging to allow cherry-picking of functionality by privacy and non-privacy distros alike: https://github.com/Whonix/anon-meta-packages/blob/master/debian/control
* providing all of Whonix improvements to Debian as reusable (by others) packages split by functionality: https://github.com/Whonix
* Timely review and merging of contributions.

== Educate ==

* Did you know, that using non-anonymous activity in one browser and anonymous activity in another browser at the same time might get you deanonymized? We [[DoNot#Do_not_use_clearnet_and_Tor_at_the_same_time.|documented that]] and [[DoNot|lots of]] other [[Warning|stuff]].
* answers are seldom disputed: http://tor.stackexchange.com/users/80/adrelanos?tab=answers
* Run a [https://forums.whonix.org/ community], doing user support.
* Extensive [[Documentation]] covering technical aspects and operational security.
