|-
! scope="row"| Anonymity
| 
* Thinking hard about obscure attacks on anonymity such as clock correlation deanonymization attacks and developing countermeasures; see [[Dev/TimeSync|TimeSync]].
* Adding support for multiple anonymity networks to cater to different user bases.
|-
! scope="row"| Invent mechanisms for rapid Debian packaging
| 
* [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/genmkfile genmkfile] - easy and turbo packaging of scripts and config files.
* Demonstrating how to write hassle free man pages.
** For example, the following methodology is used for all related {{project_name}} packages.
** Written in markdown.
** Just three lines of packaging is required.

== Cooperation ==

* Reporting issues at other projects, such as:
** [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/created_by/adrelanos Qubes]
** [https://www.virtualbox.org/query?status=%21closed&reporter=adrelanos VirtualBox]
* The Tor Project
* Successfully communicate issues in the Tor ecosystem and do so whenever we find something. Some suggestions have been implemented and others accepted.
** https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?reporter=proper&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&col=component&order=priority
** https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?reporter=adrelanos&col=id&col=summary&col=type&col=status&col=priority&col=milestone&col=component&order=priority
* Reported a number of security/privacy/anonymity issues some of them which could lead to deanonymization.
