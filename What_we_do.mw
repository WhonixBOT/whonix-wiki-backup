== Education ==

{{project_name}} undertakes a broad range of educational activities, including:
* Extensive [[Documentation]] covering technical aspects and operational security.
** Security and anonymity matters are documented in detail, including unique material not covered elsewhere. <ref>For example, the [[Warning|Tips on Remaining Anonymous]] page outlines that [[DoNot#Connect_to_a_Server_Anonymously_and_Non-anonymously_at_the_Same_Time|non-anonymous activity in one 
browser and simultaneous anonymous activity in another browser]] can lead to deanonymization.</ref> 
** Technical documentation is also provided, for example: [[Configuration_Files|Configuration Files]].
* {{project_name}} answers are seldom disputed; for example see [http://tor.stackexchange.com/users/80/adrelanos?tab=answers answers by Patrick Schleizer] on [https://tor.stackexchange.com/ Tor Stack Exchange].
* Operating a responsive [https://forums.whonix.org/ forum], providing user support for the community.
* Debian derivative development documentation, for example: [[Dev/About_Debian_Packaging|About Debian Packaging]]

== Maintenance ==

{{project_name}} maintenance activities are wide in scope and include:
* Following developments in anonymity, security and privacy and formulating solutions. For example [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Operating_System_Software_and_Updates#apt_security_update_-_DSA_4371-1 this <code>apt</code> bug] led to the posting of a [https://forums.whonix.org/t/special-instructions-required-to-securely-update-because-of-apt-security-update-dsa-4371-1/6721 news item] and  [[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates#apt_security_update_-_DSA_4371-1|instructions]] to safely resolve the matter.
* Maintaining various [[Contribute#Contributor_List|components]].
* Ongoing development: 
** Refer to this [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/{{project_name_short}}/commits/master <u>subset</u> list of {{project_name}} git commits]; and
** [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}} ~ 85 {{project_name}} source code repositories].
* Keeping the whonix.org server safe and up-to-date with various webapps (website, wiki, forums and issue tracker).
* Testing new packages.
* Calling for testers, then reviewing and processing feedback from testers.
* Creating [[Download|downloadable]] {{project_name}} builds.
* Keeping the community informed about [https://forums.whonix.org/t/recent-developments-at-whonix/7152 recent developments at Whonix].
* Porting to the next stable version of Debian. <ref>
