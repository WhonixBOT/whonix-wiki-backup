'''Introduction'''
<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">
Usually the build configuration does not need to be changed. {{project_name}} built from source code comes with safe defaults. Whonix's APT Repository will <b>not</b> be used.

The most interesting build configurations (Terminal-Only, NoDefaultApps etc.) are documented in the following chapters.

If build configurations were used earlier, it might be better to delete the build configuration folder. A few example filenames may have changed since the last build.

<pre>
sudo rm -r /etc/whonix_buildconfig.d
</pre>

Alternatively, experts can manually examine the {{Code2|/etc/whonix_buildconfig.d}} folder and change its contents to suit their preferences.

{{Code2|/etc/whonix_buildconfig.d}} is a [[{{project_name_short}}_Configuration_Files|modular flexible .d style configuration folder]].

Less popular build configurations are documented in the {{Code2|buildconfig.d}} folder and on the [[Dev/Source_Code_Intro#Build_Configuration]] page, but it is less user-friendly.

To avoid typos, it is best to copy and paste text when creating build configuration files. Take care that editors do not capitalize variable names which are supposed to be lower case during copy and paste procedures.
