|description=List of documentation articles, which were forked from Tails.
}}

= Introduction =

This is just a list. It keeps track of all documentation articles, which were forked from [https://tails.boum.org Tails]. This list will probably only be useful for myself and perhaps for the Tails developers.

Which exact version has been forked is stated inside the wiki source code in the linked articles.

For license information have a look on the linked pages and their wiki source code.

<s>There is an ''f'' button on the right top. The ''f'' stands for ''feed''. If you are interested in further forked articles you can subscribe to this page with your favorite RSS reader.</s>

This page will only be updated if new articles have been initially forked.

If you want to stay current which changes have been made to a particular page, please subscribe to the particular page.

<font size="-3">There is also a full [[Special:AllPages|index]] of all {{project name}} pages.</font>
