Users often find that the Tor network is slow. This page describes some reasons that make Tor slow. For further explanations, see [https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#WhySlow Why Tor is so slow?]

= Tor circuits lengthen the connections = <!--T:7-->
Tor provides anonymity by building circuits with three relays. So instead of connecting directly to the destination server, a connection
is made between each relay of the circuit and this takes more time.

<!--T:8-->
Furthermore, Tor tries to build circuits with relays in different countries which make connection travel more and appear slower.

= Quality of the relays = <!--T:9-->
The Tor relays are run by volunteers in a decentralized way. So all relays are not of the same quality. Some are big and fast, while some
others are smaller and slower. As a whole, the network could be faster it had more capacity. To improve the capacity of the Tor network, you
can either run a Tor relay yourself or [https://www.torservers.net/partners.html help existing relays].

= Misuse of the Tor network = <!--T:10-->
Some people misuse the Tor network, sometimes on purpose or sometimes by lack of knowledge. For instance, Tor is sometimes used to conduct
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack DDoS attacks]. By doing this, the Tor relays are the ones who actually suffer from the
attack, instead of the intended target.  Some people use [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer peer-to-peer software] through Tor which
is bad for the network.
