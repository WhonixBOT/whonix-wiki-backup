= Metadata Risk =

Metadata attached to files cannot be used to de-anonymize the user if the guidelines in this section are followed. However, whistleblowers should be aware of a host of other metadata and techniques that can be used to narrow the search for (or identify) leakers, including: <ref>https://theintercept.com/2019/08/04/whistleblowers-surveillance-fbi-trump/</ref>
<div style="column-count:2;-moz-column-count:2;-webkit-column-count:2">
* A list of persons who searched for, accessed or printed relevant documents.
* Persons inserting hardware devices like USBs into corporate computers, or those taking screenshots.
* Location data for handheld devices.
* Downloads and use of Tor Browser, Tails, Whonix or other anonymity, privacy, security and encryption (or related) software which is relatively unpopular.
* Inspection of ISP/corporate metadata associated with:
** Usernames, email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers and credit card numbers.
** Internet IP addresses and log on data.
** Clearnet browsing and use of the Tor network.
** All communications metadata, including the type, source and destination, and the file size and duration of the communication. This includes emails and (encrypted) messaging.
* Via search warrants, sourcing all data from Google, Facebook and other corporate accounts; for example, all Gmail messages, Google History, web browser activity based on web browser cookies, and backups of (Android) phones.
* Other information discovered after forensic analysis of personal computers, external HDDs/SSDs, phones and other devices. 
</div>

Be aware that most whistleblowers are identified by events and patterns of behavior that happen <u>before</u> they decide to blow the whistle or contact the media.

= Guidelines =

== General Principles ==

* Always think twice before uploading/sharing anything.
* Only upload/share files which were either created or downloaded inside the {{workstation_product_name}} and personally stripped of metadata.
* Before uploading/sharing photos or videos, it is safest to utilize a separate camera that is only used for anonymous purposes (unless the user is an expert).

== Specific File Format Data Leakage ==

* Anonymous photo sharing requires consideration of both metadata <u>and</u> [[Surfing_Posting_Blogging#Photographs|fingerprintable camera anomalies]].
* Files created by editing software -- such as Microsoft Word, LibreOffice, Excel and so on -- can leak information about incremental edits and updates. Re-saving a final copy of the document might be enough to mitigate this risk, but further research is required.
* If [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG JPEG images] are stored in PDFs in their complete form without modification, EXIF data can be leaked.
* It is possible for adversaries to link 'anonymous' [[Surfing_Posting_Blogging#Audio_Recordings|audio recordings]] to specific hardware (microphone) that is used, as well as fingerprint embedded audio acoustics associated with particular speakers -- the same [[Surfing_Posting_Blogging#Operational_Security_Advice|operational security advice]] recommended for photographs must be followed.
* This is an inexhaustive list of file format leak problems and the user should understand that file format specifications are not designed with potential adversaries in mind. <ref name=an-overview-of-pdf-potential-leaks>
https://speakerdeck.com/ange/an-overview-of-pdf-potential-leaks</ref>

== Scrubbing Metadata ==

Generally speaking, the only reliable way to scrub any type of document and avoid unintended leaks is to first use Imagemagick to convert them to images, then import them into a new PDF before distribution. This technique is reportedly used by advanced adversaries. <ref name=an-overview-of-pdf-potential-leaks /> 

This recommendation comes with an important caveat: untrusted files that are downloaded cannot be sanitized in this way, since malicious data can be crafted to remain intact even if processed by a format encoder. Therefore, the best way to interact with these files is to utilize the {{workstation_product_name}} and sanitize them with the pre-installed [https://0xacab.org/jvoisin/mat2 MAT2] program. <ref>Refer to the Metadata anonymisation toolkit v2 website for further information.</ref>

Failure to remove metadata does not always lead to de-anonymization, but it still may result in identity correlation to the same pseudonym. Consider the following example: 

* A video is created with media software and uploaded to a popular video portal under pseudonym A.
* Another video is created using the same software and computer and uploaded under pseudonym B.
* An adversary who checks the metadata of both video files would quickly correlate both pseudonyms.

== Warning on Leaking Original Source Documents ==

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text    = In recent times, leakers of high-value or high-security source documents have been identified (and jailed) via [http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2017/06/23/fingerprinting-documents-with-steganography.html embedded steganographic messages] or the [https://www.zachaysan.com/writing/2017-12-30-zero-width-characters zero-width space (homoglyph substitution)] technique. <ref>In the latter method, the leaker is unable to see additional zero-width or zero-width non-joiner characters which are used to fingerprint text. Even a single type of zero-width character provides enough bits of entropy to fingerprint the relevant text.</ref>
}}

It is highly unlikely that file cleaners will defeat these advanced fingerprinting methods. Persons who are considering leaking valuable, original source documents should adopt a far safer approach to avoid the threat of embedded signatures. Recommendations include: <ref>https://www.zachaysan.com/writing/2017-12-30-zero-width-characters</ref>

* Manually retype the related disclosures in a basic text editor which can easily be stripped of meta-data.
* Only leak short excerpts so the amount of information shared is kept to a minimum.
* At all times, avoid releasing the original documents in their raw form.
* Source the same documents from multiple leakers to confirm the content is identical byte-wise.

Specific cleaning tools do exist that strip non-whitelisted characters from the text. However, this is the least preferred approach for "safely" sharing documents if personal liberty is at stake.

= MAT2: Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit v2 =

At the time of writing, the latest version of MAT2 currently supports the following file formats: <ref name=MAT2>https://packages.debian.org/buster/mat2</ref>
<blockquote>
* Audio Video Interleave (.avi)
* Electronic Publication (.epub)
* Free Lossless Audio Codec (.flac)
* Graphics Interchange Format (.gif)
* Hypertext Markup Language (.html)
* Portable Network Graphics (PNG)
* JPEG (.jpeg, .jpg, ...)
* MPEG Audio (.mp3, .mp2, .mp1, .mpa)
* MPEG-4 (.mp4)
* Office Openxml (.docx, .pptx, .xlsx, ...)
* Ogg Vorbis (.ogg)
* Open Document (.odt, .odx, .ods, ...)
* Portable Document Fileformat (.pdf)
* Tape ARchive (.tar, .tar.bz2, .tar.gz)
* Torrent (.torrent)
* Windows Media Video (.wmv)
* ZIP (.zip)
</blockquote>

Take careful note of MAT2's limitations: <ref name=MAT2 />

<blockquote>
MAT2 only removes metadata from your files, it does not anonymise their content, nor can it handle watermarking, steganography, or any too custom metadata field/system.

If you really want to be anonymous, use file formats that do not contain any metadata, or better: use plain-text. 
</blockquote>

== Use Instructions ==

MAT2 does not have a GUI option and must be run from the command line. For a list of available MAT2 options, launch a terminal in {{workstation_product_name}} and run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
mat2
}}

<u>Note</u>: MAT2 does not clean files in-place. Instead, once 'dirty' files (with removable metadata) are cleaned, the clean files are created in the same directory with the {{code|.cleaned}} extension. For example,  "myfile.png" will lead to a new version named "myfile.cleaned.png".

Users also report that MAT2 is broken if bubblewrap is installed, since it is automatically used for MAT2 sandboxing which is currently incompatible with {{project_name}} <code>hidepid</code> settings. <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/install-bubblewrap-by-default-to-make-use-of-mat2s-sandboxing/8177</ref> <ref>https://0xacab.org/jvoisin/mat2/issues/120</ref> <ref>https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap/issues/198</ref> If this error is encountered, it can be bypassed with the <code>--no-sandbox</code> flag.

= Other Tools =

* [https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=Exiftool Exiftool] - a Perl application for editing metadata in a wide variety of files.
* [https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=exiv2 exiv2] - a C++ application to manage image metadata.
* [https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=jhead jhead] - a JPEG header manipulation tool.
