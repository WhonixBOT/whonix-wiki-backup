= What is Metadata? =
Office documents, pictures, videos and other files contain lots of information in the meta tags that may deanonymize their author. Before uploading them to the Internet you should remove this meta data.

For more information about metadata please read the [https://mat.boum.org/ MAT] website. Information about metadata can also be found on the Warning page, see [[Warning#Whonix_doesn.27t_clear_the_metadata_of_your_documents | Whonix doesn't clear the metadata of your documents]].

= Guidelines =

Metadata can not be used to de-anonymization, if you follow the following guidelines:

* Always think twice before uploading anything.
* Upload files only, which you, either:
** created inside your Whonix-Workstation
** downloaded using your Whonix-Workstation
** carefully scrubbed yourself
* For example, if you want to upload photos or videos, unless you know what you are doing, get a separate camera, which you only use for anonymous usage.
* Keep in mind that even if de-anonymization is not possible, identity correlation to the same pseudonym might still happen. For example, let's suppose you created a video using a video creation software and uploaded it to a popular video portal under the pseudonym A. Then you created another video using the same software on the same machine and uploaded it under the pseudonym B. An adversary checking the metadata could correlate pseudonym A with pseudonym B.
* Look into [https://mat.boum.org/ MAT] (Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit). Preinstalled on Whonix.

= MAT - Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit =

Start graphical user interface from start menu:

<pre>Start menu button -> Applications -> Utilities -> Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit</pre>

Or the command line interface:

<pre>
mat
# or for gui
mat-gui
</pre>

Add the files you want to clean to the list. The "dirty" state indicates that the file contains removable metadata. After cleaning, the cleaned files will be created in the same directory as the original files with the extension ".cleaned".
