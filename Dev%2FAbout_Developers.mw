= About Developers =

Whonix initially has been created by (at least) three people, see [[Authorship]]. A lot other people reserve credit, as outlined on the Authorship page. Please carefully read the [[{{project name short}}:General_disclaimer|Disclaimer]].

Documenting what {{project name}} does and what {{project name}} does not do is more a task for documenting what it does not do. Quoted from the [[About]] page: "Remember, {{project name}} is based on Debian, KDE, VirtualBox, Tor and Tor Browser. It is nothing very special. To oversimplify it: {{project name}} is just a collection of configuration files. <sup>1</sup>"

The result (Whonix) creates a picture in some people's minds that Patrick Schleizer (Whonix developer) must be similar to Tor developers a genius and expert for all kinds of technical topics. The facts are quite the opposite...

Patrick Schleizer:

* Has initiated the TorBOX project, which was later renamed to Whonix. (See [[History]].)
* Initially had some help by (at least) two different people.
* Many improvements are based on reading documentation, papers, researching, stating questions, discussion, communication with the community.

What Patrick Schleizer is NOT an expert for:

* Tor source code
* Tor anonymity
* Security
* Vulnerabilities
* Exploits
* Hardening
* ...

Creating {{project name}} was quite simple and you'll see it yourself if you care to read the source code and technical design. There was a learning curve involved and time investment. That does NOT make me automatically an expert in all kinds of topics.
