|description=Host Firewall Installation and Configuration
}}

= Introduction =

It is recommended to use a simple host firewall and deny any incoming connections on all ports. For a Linux host OS like Debian, Ubuntu and Arch Linux, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncomplicated_Firewall gufw] provides a simple graphical user interface for the Uncomplicated Firewall program. <ref>Uncomplicated Firewall by itself only provides a command-line interface for managing the netfilter firewall. Iptables are used by the program for configuration.</ref>

= How-to: Install and Configure a Firewall =

The following steps install [https://packages.debian.org/jessie/gufw gufw on a Debian host].

1. Install gufw.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gufw
}}

2. Start gufw.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gufw
}}

3. Press <code>Unlock</code>. Enter the password.

4. Press <code>Enabled</code>. <ref>The firewall is disabled by default.</ref>

5. Check the settings.

By default, the settings should be <code>Incoming: Deny</code> and <code>Outgoing: Allow</code>.

Although not recommended, users can add special firewall rules, use pre-configured options for common programs and services, or set other advanced options in gufw by following [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Gufw this guide].

For further information on firewalls, see [[Host_Firewall|here]].
