= Introduction =

It is recommended to use a simple host firewall and deny any incoming connections on all ports. For a Linux host OS like Debian, Ubuntu and Arch Linux, [https://gufw.org/ gufw] provides a simple graphical user interface for the [https://wiki.debian.org/Uncomplicated%20Firewall%20%28ufw%29 Uncomplicated Firewall] program. <ref>Uncomplicated Firewall by itself only provides a command-line interface for managing the netfilter firewall. [https://wiki.debian.org/iptables Iptables] are used by the program for configuration.</ref> It is easy to perform common tasks like blocking or allowing P2P, individual, or pre-configured ports.
