|description=Host Firewall Installation and Configuration
|image=https://www.whonix.org/w/images/9/9e/Firewall-34227640.png
}}

= Introduction =

It is recommended to use a simple host firewall and deny any incoming connections on all ports. For a Linux host OS like Debian, Ubuntu and Arch Linux, [https://gufw.org/ gufw] provides a simple graphical user interface for the [https://wiki.debian.org/Uncomplicated%20Firewall%20%28ufw%29 Uncomplicated Firewall] program. <ref>Uncomplicated Firewall by itself only provides a command-line interface for managing the netfilter firewall. [https://wiki.debian.org/iptables Iptables] are used by the program for configuration.</ref> It is easy to perform common tasks like blocking or allowing pre-configured, individual, or common P2P ports.

= How-to: Install and Configure a Firewall =

The following steps install [https://packages.debian.org/{{Stable_Whonix_based_on_Debian_codename}}/gufw gufw on a Debian host].

'''1.''' Install gufw.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gufw
}}

'''2.''' Start gufw.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gufw
}}

'''3.''' Press <code>Unlock</code>. Enter the password.

'''4.''' Press <code>Enabled</code>. <ref>The firewall is disabled by default.</ref>

'''5.''' Check the settings.

By default, the settings should be <code>Incoming: Deny</code> and <code>Outgoing: Allow</code>.

Although not recommended, users can add special firewall rules, use pre-configured options for common programs and services, or set other advanced options in gufw by following [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Gufw this guide].

For further information on firewalls, see [[Host_Firewall|here]].
