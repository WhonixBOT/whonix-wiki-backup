== Introduction ==

Multiple Whonix-Gateways can be used alongside multiple Whonix-Workstations, but this has both advantages and disadvantages. One security benefit is the isolation of separate Whonix-Gateway VM instances. In the event that one Whonix-Gateway is compromised, it is not certain the other(s) will be similarly compromised. On the downside, newly cloned Whonix-Gateway(s) will end up with a different set of Tor entry guards unless precautions are taken. <ref>Such as manually configuring identical Tor entry guards. Qube-Whonix users can [[Tor#Copy_Tor_Configuration_files_and_Settings_to_Another_sys-whonix_Instance|copy the Tor state folder to another <code>sys-whonix</code>]] instance or use the same [[Bridges]].</ref> <ref>At present, full instructions are not available for every Non-Qubes-Whonix platform.</ref> 

In this configuration ISPs are probably capable of detecting that two different Tor data folders are in use, but this is not necessarily an anonymity threat. Similarly, if multiple Tor Browsers are used with distinct Whonix-Gateways, then a different set of Tor entry guards will be used as well (unless by chance the same Tor guards are chosen for different Whonix-Gateways).

== Qubes-Whonix ==

It is simple to create additional Whonix-Gateways (<code>sys-whonix</code> instances) in [[Qubes|Qubes-Whonix]]; see 
[[Qubes/Create_Gateway_ProxyVMs|Create Gateway ProxyVMs]].

The only requirement is that the newly created <code>sys-whonix</code> is based on the <code>{{whonix-gw}}</code> TemplateVM and has a <u>distinctive VM name</u>, so it is not confused with other VMs.

=== Introduction ===
When multiple Whonix-Gateways are run in paralell, the risks explained in the [[Multiple_Whonix-Workstations#Safety_Precautions|Multiple Whonix-Workstations: Safety Precautions]] section equally apply.

=== VirtualBox ===
In this case, it is necessary to change the Whonix-Gateway network ''interface2'' and Whonix-Workstation network ''interface1'' from internal network <code>Whonix</code> to something else.

= Multiple Qubes-Whonix TemplateVMs =

Multiple [[Qubes-Whonix]] TemplateVMs provides much greater flexibility over a single template when choosing software packages. The additional cloned templates can be customized with software to meet specific requirements; something impossible to achieve with a single TemplateVM. <ref>Optionally, the default template can be cloned and used as the default template for AppVMs. Having a “known-good” backup template available at all times is best practice.</ref>

* '''Packages from a later release:''' Installing packages from a later release could end up breaking the system. For example, mixing packages from [https://wiki.debian.org/DebianStable Debian Stable] with those of a later release like [https://wiki.debian.org/DebianTesting Debian Testing] can lead to an unstable system because of associated software dependencies required for full functionality. <ref>Using packages from different repositories can lead to [[Install Software#Dependency_Hell|Dependency Hell]].</ref> <ref>This problem can be avoided by cloning additional Whonix templates and preferring packages from a single repository in each TemplateVM.</ref> Prior to installing Debian packages from a later release, first read [[Install Software#Install_from_Debian_testing|Install from Debian testing]].
* '''Custom software:''' Additional cloned templates makes it easy to install custom software used for a specific application. For example, users could [[Tunnel UDP over Tor]] by configuring <code>{{whonix-ws}}</code> to route all applications through a VPN tunnel. However, this method also increases the risk of identity correlation. To mitigate this risk, the AppVM based on this template should only be used for the particular application that must be routed through the <i>tunnel-link</i>.  Before installing custom software it is recommended to first read [[Install Software#General_Advice|Install Software General Advice]].
* '''Untrusted packages:''' It is unwise to install untrusted packages in a template used for sensitive activities. With multiple cloned TemplateVMs, a single template can be designated as a less trusted domain for that purpose. <ref>It is strongly encouraged to only install signed packages from a trusted source.</ref> Read [https://qubes-os.org/doc/software-update-vm/#notes-on-trusting-your-templatevms Notes on trusting your TemplateVM(s)] prior to installing untrusted packages.

Cloning templates in [[Qubes-Whonix]] is easily accomplished via Qube Manager. Be careful with naming conventions for both TemplateVMs and AppVMs (based on those templates) so they are not confused with each other. This will minimize the chance of basing an AppVM on the wrong template. 

When creating AppVMs based on cloned TemplateVMs, a purpose-based naming convention is sensible so there is no ambiguity regarding the intended function of an AppVM. For example, if an AppVM is created to tunnel UDP over Tor, appending <code>tunnel-udp</code> (the purpose) to the end of <code>anon-whonix</code> would lead to the name <code>anon-whonix-tunnel-udp</code>. 

To clone Qubes-Whonix TemplateVMs, follow the instructions below.

{{Box|text=
Cloning Qubes VMs is a simple process in Qube Manager:

<code>Qube Manager</code> -> <code>VM to be Cloned</code> -> <code>Clone qube</code> -> <code>Enter name for Qube clone</code> <br />

'''Figure:''' ''Cloning Whonix qubes''<br />
[[Image:Screenshot-clone-vm-qubes.png]]

When prompted, give the newly cloned VM a name that is not easily confused with other VMs. This minimizes the chances of basing an AppVM on the wrong template; there could be serious security concerns if a "trusted" AppVM was based on the wrong TemplateVM with untrusted packages.

If you like to change the UpdatesProxy setting for any TemplateVM, apply the following steps.

{{Box|text=
In dom0. Open <code>/etc/qubes-rpc/policy/qubes.UpdatesProxy</code> with root rights.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo nano /etc/qubes-rpc/policy/qubes.UpdatesProxy
}}

TODO: the following steps require testing.

Add at the very top of that file.

Syntax:

<pre>
name-of-template-vm $default allow,target=name-of-proxy-vm
</pre>

For example:

{{CodeSelect|code=
whonix-ws-14-clone-1 $default allow,target=sys-whonix-cloned
}}

Save.

<pre>
<Ctrl-X> --> press Y --> <Enter>
</pre>

The procedure is now complete.
