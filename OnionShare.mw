== Introduction ==

OnionShare is an open source program that allows a file of any size to be shared securely and anonymously using the Tor network. <ref>https://onionshare.org/</ref> The OnionShare wiki succinctly describes the design: <ref>https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/wiki</ref>

<blockquote>It works by starting a web server, making it accessible as a Tor Onion Service, and generating an unguessable URL to access and download the files. It does not require setting up a separate server or using a third party file-sharing service. You host the files on your own computer and use a Tor Onion Service to make it temporarily accessible over the internet. The receiving user just needs to open the URL in Tor Browser to download the file.</blockquote>

As of OnionShare 2, it is also possible to run the program in Receive mode, which allows you to receive files via OnionShare, uploaded by users using Tor Browser - a sort of 'SecureDrop Lite', or personal dropbox.

At the time of writing, the OnionShare package is not packaged in Debian stretch. <ref>https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/onionshare</ref> For these reasons, the following instructions use the most recent version available from GitHub. Advanced users may prefer to use APT pinning to install the version from Debian buster instead. However, installing from a tagged release in Git ensures you have access to the latest features.

== Install OnionShare ==

'''1.''' ''Optional'': Create a separate Whonix-Workstation ([[Qubes-Whonix]]: <code>anon-onionshare</code> AppVM).

Note: This is not strictly necessary, but best practice is to separate anonymous activities of a different nature in distinct VMs (AppVMs). <ref>Qubes-Whonix users should note the <code>{{whonix-ws}}</code> TemplateVM will pull in over 70Mb of dependencies at step 6. Consider creating a separate, cloned <code>{{whonix-ws}}</code> TemplateVM for this purpose beforehand.</ref>

In [[Qubes-Whonix]], to clone the existing <code>anon-whonix</code>: 

<code>Qube Manager</code> -> <code>Right-click on anon-vm</code> -> <code>Select "<u>C</u>lone qube"</code> -> <code>Rename to "anon-onionshare"</code>

'''2.''' Install git in Whonix-Workstation (<code>anon-onionshare</code>).

Open a terminal (Konsole) in Whonix-Workstation (<code>anon-onionshare</code>) and navigate to the persistent home directory. 

{{CodeSelect|code=
cd /home/user
}}

Next install git which is not available by default in the VM (AppVM). <ref>The git installation will not persist in Qubes-Whonix following reboot. This method avoids polluting the <code>{{whonix-ws}}</code> TemplateVM upon which it is based.</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install git
}}

'''3.''' Clone the OnionShare directory.

This will pull the OnionShare source code directly from GitHub.

{{CodeSelect|code=
git clone https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare.git
}}

Next navigate to the OnionShare directory.

{{CodeSelect|code=
cd onionshare
}}

'''4.''' Retrieve the OnionShare PGP signing key.

This step retrieves the OnionShare developer's PGP key using its long key ID. <ref>The OnionShare core developer is Micah Lee. The key ID has been taken directly from www.micahflee.com</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 0x927F419D7EC82C2F149C1BD1403C2657CD994F73
}}

'''5.''' Examine and verify the git tags and commit.

These steps list the available git tags, and verifies the latest version and its commit (v2.0 at the time of writing).

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text       = Good signature messages should appear for each verify command below. Do not proceed if signatures are bad! In that case, remove the OnionShare directory and repeat step 3.
}}


{{CodeSelect|code=
git tag
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
git verify-tag v2.0
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
git verify-commit v2.0^{commit}
}}

Qubes-Whonix users should shut down <code>anon-onionshare</code> prior to the next step.

'''6.''' Install OnionShare dependencies.

Several dependencies must be installed in Whonix-Workstation (<code>{{whonix-ws}}</code> TemplateVM) for OnionShare to work correctly. Locate the {{Code2|BUILD.md}} file in the OnionShare repository and run the necessary apt-get commands in the "Debian-like distros" section.

For example, for OnionShare 2 run in a terminal (Konsole).

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt install -y python3-flask python3-stem python3-pyqt5 python3-crypto python3-socks python-nautilus tor obfs4proxy python3-pytest build-essential fakeroot python3-all python3-stdeb dh-python
}}

Qubes-Whonix users should shutdown the <code>{{whonix-ws}}</code> TemplateVM after dependencies have installed, and restart the <code>anon-onionshare</code> AppVM.

'''7.''' Extend the onion-grater whitelist in Whonix-Gateway (<code>sys-whonix</code>).

{{Control_Port_Filter_Python_Profile_Add|
filename=/usr/share/onion-grater-merger/examples/40_onionshare.yml
}}

'''8.''' Modify the Whonix-Workstation (<code>anon-onionshare</code>) user firewall settings and reload them.

{{Firewall Settings Workstation}}

Add. <ref>As per https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/7870#note-15 OnionShare uses ports 17600 to 17659.</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
EXTERNAL_OPEN_PORTS+=" $(seq 17600 17659) "
}}

Save.

{{Reload_Firewall_Whonix-Workstation}}

== Start OnionShare ==

To start OnionShare in Whonix-Workstation (<code>anon-onionshare</code>) first navigate to the OnionShare folder.

{{CodeSelect|code=
cd onionshare
}}

Then either run the command line interface or GUI version, depending on your preference.

{{CodeSelect|code=
./dev_scripts/onionshare
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
./dev_scripts/onionshare-gui
}}

Advanced users can also build an OnionShare package to install. <ref>https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/blob/master/BUILD.md#gnulinux</ref> <ref>To create a .deb on Debian, run: <code>./install/build_deb.sh</code></ref>

=== OnionShare Configuration ===

On the first run of OnionShare:

* Select the settings button/icon (cog symbol) in the GUI.
* Under “How should OnionShare connect to Tor?” choose “Connect using socket file”, and set the socket file to ''/var/run/tor/control''
* Under “Tor authentication options” choose “No authentication, or cookie authentication”.

To test OnionShare is running correctly:

* Click the “Test Settings” button. If all steps were completed correctly, Tor will successfully connect.
* The GUI should say it supports both ephemeral onion services and stealth onion services.
* You can check “Create stealth onion services” (Client Auth) to make OnionShare operations more secure - however, this currently only works with legacy 'v2' (shorter) style onions. Support for Client Auth with v3/prop224/next-gen onions will be possible in a future release. 
** Note: Using Stealth mode makes it harder for the end user to connect to the share, because they must first edit their torrc file. Please see the [https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/wiki/Stealth-Onion-Services official documentation] for further information.
* By default, if the version of Tor in use is 0.3.5.7 or higher (as it is in Whonix 14), OnionShare will use next-gen or 'v3' (sometimes referred to as prop224) onion addresses by default. These are recognizable by their longer address. You can enable Legacy Mode in the settings if for some reason you want to use the shorter (but less secure) v2 onion addresses.

=== How to Use OnionShare ===

Once OnionShare has been installed correctly and the Tor check is successful, sharing files anonymously is easy: <ref>https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/wiki</ref>

<blockquote>Open OnionShare, drag and drop files and folders you wish to share into it, and click Start Sharing. After a moment, it will show you a .onion URL such as http://asxmi4q6i7pajg2b.onion/egg-cain. This is the secret URL that can be used to download the file you're sharing.<br />
<br />
Send this URL to the person you're sending the files to. If the files you're sending aren't secret, you can use normal means of sending the URL, like by emailing it, or sending it in a Facebook or Twitter private message. If you're sending secret files then it's important to send this URL securely.<br />
<br />
The person who is receiving the files doesn't need OnionShare. All they need is to open the URL you send them in Tor Browser to be able to download the file.
</blockquote>

As of OnionShare 2, a new feature exists called 'Receive Mode'. With this mode, you can start an onion service and allow other users to upload files to ''you'' via Tor Browser (rather than Share Mode, in which you share files from your OnionShare to those users). You can read more about Receive Mode [https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/wiki/Receive-Mode in the OnionShare wiki].

A complete user guide, along with advanced topics, hardening options <ref>Such as setting a Shutdown Timer to self-destruct shares if they are not downloaded within an acceptable time window. These topics are beyond the scope of this documentation.</ref> and development documentation is available on the [https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/wiki official website]. Do not change settings without fully understanding their function, otherwise onion addresses might be re-used, shares might be left open even after multiple downloads are performed, and so on.

== OnionShare AppArmor Profiles ==

AppArmor profiles are available to better contain OnionShare, but they have not yet been tested in Whonix. <ref>https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/tree/develop/apparmor</ref> Profile development is reported to be lagging behind the master and development branches of the OnionShare git repository. Therefore, willing testers should be knowledgeable about AppArmor profiles before attempting this procedure. 

Advanced users are encouraged to help progress the [https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/issues/686 open OnionShare AppArmor ticket] and help complete this wiki section. Successes or failures can also be reported in the [http://forums.{{Whonix_onion}}/c/apparmor Whonix AppArmor forum].

TODO: Test profiles and expand this section.
