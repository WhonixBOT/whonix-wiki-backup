= Introduction =

OnionShare is an open source program that allows users to share/receive files, host a website or chat anonymously utilizing the Tor network. <ref>https://onionshare.org/</ref> OnionShare is installed by default as of {{project_name}} 15. The OnionShare wiki succinctly describes the design: <ref>https://docs.onionshare.org/</ref>

<blockquote>Web servers are started locally on your computer and made accessible to other people as [https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/ Tor onion services].

By default, OnionShare web addresses are protected with a random password. A typical OnionShare address might look something like this:

<code>http://onionshare:constrict-purity@by4im3ir5nsvygprmjq74xwplrkdgt44qmeapxawwikxacmr3dqzyjad.onion</code>

You’re responsible for securely sharing that URL using a communication channel of your choice like in an encrypted chat message, or using something less secure like unencrypted e-mail, depending on your [https://ssd.eff.org/module/your-security-plan threat model].

The people you send the URL to then copy and paste it into their [https://www.torproject.org/ Tor Browser] to access the OnionShare service.</blockquote>

As of OnionShare v2 it is also possible to run the program in Receive mode. This means you can receive files via OnionShare after they are uploaded by Tor Browser users; this is a sort of 'SecureDrop Lite' or personal dropbox. Version 2.2 of OnionShare also permits the [https://micahflee.com/2019/10/new-version-of-onionshare-makes-it-easy-for-anyone-to-publish-anonymous-uncensorable-websites/ easy hosting of anonymous websites]: 

<blockquote>In addition to the “Share Files” and “Receive Files” tabs, OnionShare 2.2 introduces the “Publish Website” tab. You drag all of the files that make up your website into the OnionShare window and click “Start sharing.” It will start a web server to host your static website and give you a .onion URL. This website is only accessible from the Tor network, so people will need Tor Browser to visit it. People who visit your website will have no idea who you are – they won’t have access to your IP address, and they won’t know your identity or your location. And, so long as your website visitors are able to access the Tor network, the website can’t be censored.</blockquote>

Verion 2.3 of OnionShare allows users to share/receive files, host websites or chat anonymously at the same time using a tabs feature. The secure, ephemeral and anonymous chat feature is particularly useful since it does not require account creation, is encrypted end-to-end and reduces the risk of messages being stored locally: <ref>https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-onionshare-23</ref>

<blockquote>Now when you open OnionShare you are presented with a blank tab that lets you choose between sharing files, receiving files, hosting a website, or chatting anonymous. You can have as many tabs open as you want at a time, and you can easily save tabs (that's what the purple thumbtack in the tab bar means) so that if you quit OnionShare and open it again later, these services can start back up with the same OnionShare addresses. ... Another major new feature is chat. You start a chat service, it gives you an OnionShare address, and then you send this address to everyone who is invited to the chat room (using an encrypted messaging app like Signal, for example). Then everyone loads this address in a Tor Browser, makes up a name to go by, and can have a completely private conversation.</blockquote>

As OnionShare is an actively developed project, it is recommended to refer to [https://docs.onionshare.org/ official documentation] for the latest features and information before use. Advanced users should also consider [https://docs.onionshare.org/2.3.1/en/advanced.html additional features] like saving of tabs, turning off passwords, scheduled start/stop times, command line operations and legacy addresses.

== OnionShare Version ==

At the time of writing, Debian <code>buster</code> (which {{project name}} is based on) provides version <code>1.3.2</code> of OnionShare. This means the following instructions will only enable the anonymous sharing/receiving of files with legacy v2 onion addresses which are [https://blog.torproject.org/v2-deprecation-timeline being deprecated], will stop working around <code>July 15th, 2021</code> <ref>
Quote [https://blog.torproject.org/v2-deprecation-timeline The Tor Project: Onion Service version 2 deprecation timeline]:

<blockquote>Here is our planned deprecation timeline:
 
1. September 15th, 2020
0.4.4.x: Tor will start warning onion service operators and clients that v2 is deprecated and will be obsolete in version 0.4.6.
 
2. July 15th, 2021
0.4.6.x: Tor will no longer support v2 and support will be removed from the code base.
 
3. October 15th, 2021
We will release new Tor client stable versions for all supported series that will disable v2.</blockquote>
</ref>; this is a known [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2020-May/014322.html security risk].

Users with higher security needs should follow the [[#Flatpak_OnionShare_Installation|optional instructions]] to install a later OnionShare version with flatpak (<code>2.3.1</code> at the time of writing) to permit v3 onion connections and full functionality.

== OnionShare Configuration ==

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text    = Do not use the bundled Tor configuration for OnionShare; this would lead to a Tor-over-Tor scenario.
}}

On the first run of OnionShare: <ref>https://docs.onionshare.org/2.3.1/en/tor.html#using-a-system-tor-in-linux</ref>

# Select the settings button/icon (cog symbol) in the GUI.
# Under “How should OnionShare connect to Tor?” choose “Connect using socket file”, and set the socket file to <code>/var/run/tor/control</code>
# Under “Tor authentication options” choose “No authentication, or cookie authentication”.

To test OnionShare is running correctly:
* Click the “Test Tor Settings” button. If all steps were completed correctly, Tor will successfully connect.
* The GUI should say it supports both ephemeral onion services and stealth onion services.

'''Figure:''' ''OnionShare Settings Window''

[[Image:OnionSharetortest.png|border]]

* In v1.3.2 you can check “Create stealth onion services” (Client Auth) to make OnionShare operations more secure - however, this currently only works with legacy 'v2' (shorter) style onions. Support for Client Auth with v3/prop224/next-gen onions is available in later releases. <ref>Previously stealth mode made it harder for the end user to connect to the share, because they were required to first edit their torrc file. Official documentation no longer references any special configuration being required.</ref>
* By default, if OnionShare v2.0 or higher is installed and the system Tor version is v3.5.7 or greater (as it is in {{project name}}), OnionShare uses next-gen or 'v3' onion addresses by default. These are recognizable by their longer address. Legacy Mode can be enabled in settings if the shorter (but less secure) v2 onion addresses are desired for some reason.

== How-to: Use OnionShare ==

Once OnionShare has been installed correctly and the Tor check is successful, sharing files anonymously is easy: <ref>https://docs.onionshare.org/2.3.1/en/features.html</ref>

<blockquote>You can use OnionShare to send files and folders to people securely and anonymously. Open a share tab, drag in the files and folders you wish to share, and click “Start sharing”.
...
When you’re ready to share, click the “Start sharing” button. You can always click “Stop sharing”, or quit OnionShare, immediately taking the website down. You can also click the “↑” icon in the top-right corner to show the history and progress of people downloading files from you. <br />

Now that you have a OnionShare, copy the address and send it to the person you want to receive the files. If the files need to stay secure, or the person is otherwise exposed to danger, use an encrypted messaging app.

That person then must load the address in Tor Browser. After logging in with the random password included in the web address, the files can be downloaded directly from your computer by clicking the “Download Files” link in the corner.</blockquote>

'''Figure:''' ''OnionShare Download with Tor Browser'' <ref>https://micahflee.com/2018/02/onionshare-has-some-exciting-new-features/</ref>

[[Image:OnionSharereceive.png|border]]

Later OnionShare versions have significantly improved functionality:
* v2 provides a feature called 'Receive Mode'. With this mode, you can start an onion service and allow other users to upload files to ''you'' via Tor Browser (rather than Share Mode, in which you share files from your OnionShare to others). 
* v2.2 allows the hosting of static HTML websites.
* v2.3 allows users to set up a private, secure chat room that does not require an account and does not log activity.

A complete user guide is available, including advanced topics, hardening options <ref>Such as setting a Shutdown Timer to self-destruct shares if they are not downloaded within an acceptable time window. These topics are beyond the scope of this documentation.</ref> and development documentation; refer to the [https://docs.onionshare.org/ official website]. 

Do not change settings without fully understanding their function, otherwise onion addresses might be re-used, shares might be left open even after multiple downloads are performed, and so on.

== OnionShare AppArmor Profiles ==

AppArmor profiles are available to better contain OnionShare, but they have not yet been tested in {{project_name}}. <ref>https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/tree/develop/apparmor</ref> Profile development is reported to be lagging behind the master and development branches of the OnionShare git repository. Therefore, willing testers should be knowledgeable about AppArmor profiles before attempting this procedure. 

Advanced users are encouraged to help progress the [https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/issues/686 open OnionShare AppArmor ticket] and help complete this wiki section. Successes or failures can also be reported in the [http://forums.{{project_onion}}/c/apparmor {{project name}} AppArmor forum].
