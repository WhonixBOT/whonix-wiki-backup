Anonymous Surfing, Posting and Blogging
}}

== Introduction ==
Tor Browser is installed to surf the Internet anonymously. It is optimized to surf the Web securely and anonymously and therefore configured in a rather restricitve way. Please, read the [[Tor Browser]] article for basics.

== Posting, Blogging anonymously ==
Whonix-Workstation contains all necessary tools to run a blog anonymously. Some hints:

* For a anonymous blog you need a new and anonymous e-mail address (see separate [[E-Mail]] article] for registering the blog and possibly the communicationi first. Register a new address and use this address only in regard to your blog. Always use Tor to login into this e-mail account.
* You may register your blog at different providers anonymously. For example you could use https://wordpress.com/. Keep always the option to pay anonymously (e.g via BitCoin or cash cards, ex. Paysafecard) in mind if you are using a premium product. (See [[Money]] page.) Note that cash card codes differ by country and could theoretically also contain an ID to specific in which shop they have been bought. Usually you may administrate your blog using a web interface only. Always use Tor for all activities concerning your blog.
* A browser is no safe environment to write stuff.
** You could accidentally paste things you don't want to paste for example into the search or url bar, which could trigger a search for text that you did not intend to sent into the public internet.
** With JavaScript enabled, while you type, the server already knows what you type as you type..
*** It reveals, how fast you type, how long your breaks are, which mistakes you make and how you correct them while writing the draft, also which type of local keyboard you are using.
*** It should be assumed, that such data is already being collected and analyzed.
** Write the text in an offline text editor such as KWrite and copy and paste the text into the blog interface once you are done.
* Mind your cookies! Remember to empty your browser's cookie and history cache periodically. When you are using [[Tor Browser]], which is recommended for many reasons anyway, simply close Tor Browser after you are done working on your blog, then restart it. For more advanced separation use [[Multiple Whonix-Workstations]].
* Attention should be given to the password-retention policy of the browser. If the browser supports a master password that encrypts every password it saves, use that feature. It is however best not to save your blog password in the browser.
* Every blog software offers the option to select the point in time when new postings shall be published. Do not publish a new posting "at once" but rather choose a point in time when you are not online anymore. <ref>This will trick adversaries, who can not force the blog service provider to reveal the fact, when and for how long you log in. It won't trick the blog service provider.</ref>
* Stylometry (deanonymization using your spelling style) is already an inherent part of secret service means. It is possible using (semi) automatic techniques to correlate anonymous postings to an author if the circle of suspects is sufficient small and if there are enough text examples of them. Concentrating and taking one's time while writing a blog post allow to fake one's spelling style though.
* Use a spell checker to confuse Stylometry a bit. You could use KWrite. To start it, use Start menu button -> Applications -> Utilities -> Text Editor (KWrite). Once KWrite is open, click on Tools -> Automatic spell checking. Mistyped words will be underlined with red color.
* Generally, before uploading to the blog pictures and other documents must get anonymized. Usually, pictures contain a unique camera id in the meta tags, which may deanonymize you, and perhaps GPS (location) coordinates. See [[Metadata]] for more information. See also [[#Anonymous Photo Sharing]] below.

Every camera's sensor has a unique noise signature because of subtle hardware differences. The sensor noise is detectable in the pixels of every image and video shot with the camera and could be fingerprinted. In the same way ballistics forensics can trace a bullet to the barrel it came from, the same can be accomplished with adversarial digital forensics for all images and videos. <ref>http://dde.binghamton.edu/download/camera_fingerprint/</ref> <ref>[https://github.com/guardianproject/ObscuraCam/issues/102 Fingerprintable Camera Anomalies]</ref> Major data mining corporations are starting to use this technique to associate identities of camera owners with everything or everyone else they shoot. <ref>https://www.google.com/patents/US20150124107</ref> It follows that government's have had the same capabilities for some time now and can apply to their vast troves of data.

Note that this is different from file [[Metadata]] that may be sanitized with the Metadata Anonymization Toolkit.

There are no known countermeasures for this attack. Research on the question of spoofing sensor fingerprints in image files has proven non trivial and easily defeated.<ref>http://ws2.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Research/EI7541-29.pdf</ref>

Operational Security Advice:

* This advice assumes wanting to preserve anonymity when publicly sharing media in the face of even the most sophisticated adversaries on the internet. Examine your threat model. These steps don't apply for communications that never leave anonymous encrypted channels between trusted and technically competent parties.

* Its almost a certainty that you've shared photos and videos from your current devices through non-anonymous channels. Do NOT use any of these devices to shoot media you intend on sharing anonymously.

* You will probably want to avoid phones altogether and use tablets but for most situations they are a reasonable choice. Buy a new Android phone with cash if possible. Avoid other choices because proprietary operating system is a non starter. You MUST flash a freedom and privacy respecting ROM before using your camera. Beware that the corporate malware infestation that comes with the phone out of the box siphons your data to the cloud aka spy heaven.

* Do NOT mix up purposes of this camera and keep it reserved for anonymous media only.

* Do NOT do obvious stupid mistakes like taking selfies or photographing places or people associated with you. 

* Do sanitize exif data with MAT before sharing anonymously online.

* Consider using the [https://guardianproject.info/apps/obscuracam/ ObscuraCam] app from The Guardian Project to protect the identities of protestors.

Watermarking is a subset of the science of stenagoraphy. It can apply to any type of digital media. Goals of watermarking are to trace back information leaks to a source. This is done by embedding covert data into the "noise" of data imperceptible to humans. A digital watermark is said to be robust if it remains intact even if modifications are made to the files.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_watermarking</ref>

A good countermeasure is to run documents through an OCR and share the output instead.

According to a talk by Sarah Harrison from WikiLeaks, source tracing can happen through much simpler techniques such as looking at access lists for the materials. For example if only three people have access to a set of documents then the hunt is narrowed down considerably.
