= Installation =
The order in which these commands are run matter. <ref>
Also apt update cannot be skipped since package contents files need to be downloaded.
</ref> But the process is idempotent. Meaning possible to re-apply all of the following steps.

'''1.''' Delete [https://github.com/Whonix/usability-misc/blob/master/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/30usability-misc <code>/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/30usability-misc</code>] because it contains settings that [https://forums.whonix.org/t/speeding-up-apt-update-with-acquire-languages-none-and-contents-deb-defaultenabled-false-its-so-much-faster/8894 speed up APT] but break <code>command-not-found</code>. <ref>
<pre>
Acquire::IndexTargets::deb::Contents-deb::DefaultEnabled false;
</pre>

breaks <code>command-not-found</code> because it requires <code>/var/lib/apt/lists/*Contents*</code> to exist.

{{CodeSelect|code=
