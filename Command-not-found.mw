= Introduction =
Quote Debian package [https://packages.debian.org/{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}/command-not-found <code>command-not-found</code>]:

<blockquote>Suggest installation of packages in interactive bash sessions

This package will install a handler for command_not_found that looks up programs not currently installed but available from the repositories.</blockquote>

= Installation =
The order in which these commands are run matter. <ref>
Also apt update cannot be skipped since package contents files need to be downloaded.
</ref> But the process is idempotent. Meaning possible to re-apply all of the following steps.

'''1.''' Delete [https://github.com/Whonix/usability-misc/blob/master/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/30usability-misc <code>/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/30usability-misc</code>] because it contains settings that [https://forums.whonix.org/t/speeding-up-apt-update-with-acquire-languages-none-and-contents-deb-defaultenabled-false-its-so-much-faster/8894 speed up APT] but break <code>command-not-found</code>. <ref>
<pre>
Acquire::IndexTargets::deb::Contents-deb::DefaultEnabled false;
</pre>

breaks <code>command-not-found</code> because it requires <code>/var/lib/apt/lists/*Contents*</code> to exist.

</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo rm -f /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/30usability-misc
}}

'''2.''' {{Install Package|
package=command-not-found
}}

'''3.''' Run <code>update-command-not-found</code> with root rights.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo update-command-not-found
}}
