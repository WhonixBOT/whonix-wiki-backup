The following instructions are useful, if you have a backup of Whonix .vmdk hard disk images but want to restore them. This could be the case if your VM settings file is damaged or missing for some reason or if you only made a backup of the .vmdk files.

In case you want to use other operating systems behind Whonix-Gateway, other than the default Whonix-Workstation, then rather read the [[OtherOperatingSystems]] page.
