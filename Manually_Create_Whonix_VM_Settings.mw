The following instructions are useful, if you have a backup of {{project name}} .vmdk hard disk images but want to restore them. This could be the case if your VM settings file is damaged or missing for some reason or if you only made a backup of the .vmdk files.

In case you want to use other operating systems behind {{gateway_product_name}}, other than the default {{workstation_product_name}}, then rather read the [[Other Operating Systems]] page.
