== Introduction ==

The advanced and pervasive state of modern surveillance should never be underestimated: <ref>https://www.yalelawjournal.org/forum/why-rely-on-the-fourth-amendment-to-do-the-work-of-the-first</ref>

<blockquote>Their recent evolution has been not incremental, but abrupt. The crucial advance of modern surveillance has been the development of inexpensive automation. Where before the government had to rely on human agents or informants to spy, today it spies through a proliferating network of unsleeping sensors. And where before agents had to manually review what they collected, today they use computers to make sense of their harvest. The government’s appetite for digitally collected data has grown in conjunction with its capabilities for collection and analysis. And, when law enforcement agencies cannot sate that appetite directly, they feast, instead, on data accumulated by private companies.<br />
<br />
The result of these advances is that, for the first time in human history, the government can now engage in nearly pervasive surveillance of the public. We have seen a glimpse of that reality already, through Edward Snowden’s disclosures to the press of the breathtaking scope of surveillance by the National Security Agency and recent reports on law enforcement’s expanding use of new and invasive technologies like cell-site simulators, automated license plate readers, pervasive aerial surveillance systems, and facial-recognition databases.<br />
<br />
The trend in technology is to reduce virtually everything we do to digital data. Our cellphones are livestreams of our locations; our internet-usage histories are unintended journals of our thoughts; our e-mails are often-permanent records of once-ephemeral conversations. Newer technologies digitize even more of our lives: smart watches, smart TVs, smart refrigerators, smart cars, and a host of other internet-connected devices have made The Wizard of Oz’s technicolor transition seem impossibly quaint.</blockquote>

== Capabilities ==

In order to develop proper means for anonymity, one must estimate the technological capabilities of adversaries (typically corporations, criminals, repressive government). If you are not too technologically or scientifically educated, or if signal intelligence sounds somewhat mythical to you, then you will be rather challenged in trying to properly assess such capabilities, distinguishing facts from fantasy.

First, a simple overview. A highly technologically capable adversary (e.g., a military counter-intelligence unit) can:

* intercept your internet traffic, including e-mail, instant messaging, VoIP, and Wi-Fi connections (though the latter doesn't directly involve ISPs)
* intercept your phone and fax communications, including landlines, cell phones, satellite phones, and radio telephone extensions (the latter doesn't involve telecommunications providers ("telcos"))
* associate your geographic location with a cell phone IMEI number or with a SIM card number
* reliably associate your calls with your voice patterns (speaker recognition)
* associate your geographic location with your digital financial transactions

This passive surveillance can be performed constantly and concurrently for a large number of people (who are not specifically suspected of anything), and all data gathered can be retained indefinitely. We see that the technological resources of a modern adversary are virtually unlimited, and any task that can be automated is implemented and deployed.

However, the non-technological resources of an adversary are definitely limited. The adversary cannot:

* break modern encryption protocols
* perform active surveillance on non-suspects (e.g., break into computers) -- the chances of being caught are too high.
* have human officers or employees read or listen to large amounts of communication
* recognize your face from a satellite (although [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle UAVs] are a different story)
* have large quantities of qualified human resources.
