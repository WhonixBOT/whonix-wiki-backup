One of the primary objectives of <code>grub-live</code> is preventing [[malware|malware]] from gaining persistence and having an unchanged system after reboot. It would require [[Malware#Targeted_Malware_vs_Off-The-Shelf_Malware|targeted]] <ref>
Re-mounting the disk for write access is not yet a default feature available to off-the-shelf malware; no such reports have come to our attention.
</ref> [[Malware|malware]] which gains super user (root) access to re-mount the disk for write access.

It is also recommended to regularly boot into persistent mode for installation of [[Update|updates]].

There are two choices:

* <code>[https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/grub-live grub-live]</code>:  Boots into persistent mode by default. The grub boot menu has an option to boot into live mode.
* <code>grub-default-live</code>: Boots into live mode by default. The grub boot menu has an option to boot into persistent mode.

This is also a useful tool for better privacy on the hard drive, as well as experimental changes like testing software.

Tails takes care not to use any filesystem that might exist on the host machine hard drive, unless explicitly told to do so by the user. The Debian Live persistence feature is disabled by passing <code>nopersistence</code> over the kernel command line to live-boot.

https://git-tails.immerda.ch/tails/plain/config/chroot_local-includes/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00_Tails_defaults contains a configuration for GNOME only. This is reasonable in the Tails context since its default desktop is GNOME and others are unsupported.

| Live Mode Usability <ref>The user being aware of currently running in live mode vs persistent mode.</ref>

Without Live Mode Indicator (see below) it is not obvious to the user if they booted into persistent or live mode. This might lead to a mistake where live boot is not selected from the grub boot menu (persistent mode is instead set), but the user believes otherwise.
