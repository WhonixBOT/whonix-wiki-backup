{{live}}
Users can optionally run [[Main Page|{{project_name}}]] as a live system. '''{{free}}''' Either by using:
 
* [[VM Live Mode]], <u>or</u> 
* [[Host Live Mode]] (this page).

This is only available for Debian, [[Kicksecure]] and perhaps other Debian based hosts.

One of the primary objectives of Host Live Mode is preventing [[malware|malware]] from gaining persistence and having an unchanged system after reboot. This is also useful for improved storage device privacy as well as experimental changes like testing software.

If you are interested in installation of {{Project name}} on USB, see [[{{project_name_short}}_on_USB|{{project_name}} on USB]].

= Introduction =
A persistent malware compromise after reboot would require [[Malware#Targeted_Malware_vs_Off-The-Shelf_Malware|targeted]] <ref>
Re-mounting the disk for write access is not yet a default feature available to off-the-shelf malware; no such reports have come to our attention.
</ref> [[Malware and Firmware Trojans|malware]] which gains super user ([[root]]) access to re-mount the disk for write access.

It is recommended to regularly boot into persistent mode for installation of [[Update|updates]].

There are two choices:

* <code>[https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/grub-live grub-live]</code>:  Boots into persistent mode by default. The grub boot menu has an option to boot into live mode.
* <code>grub-default-live</code>: Boots into live mode by default. The grub boot menu has an option to boot into persistent mode.

This is also a useful tool for better privacy on the hard drive, as well as experimental changes like testing software.

After reboot a new <code>live mode</code> entry will appear in the grub boot menu.

Tails takes care not to use any filesystem that might exist on the host machine hard drive, unless explicitly told to do so by the user. The Debian Live persistence feature is disabled by passing <code>nopersistence</code> over the kernel command line to live-boot.

| Live Mode Usability <ref>The user being aware of currently running in live mode vs persistent mode.</ref>

Without Live Mode Indicator (see below) it is not obvious to the user if they booted into persistent or live mode. This might lead to a mistake where live boot is not selected from the grub boot menu (persistent mode is instead set), but the user believes otherwise.
