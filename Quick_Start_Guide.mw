== Documentation ==

Documentation is critical to the correct operation and maintenance of the Whonix OS. Further, technical manuals describe the operation and use of programs, and how to set up specialist configurations.

In an effort to create a high-quality, usable and stable OS, the Whonix community is making every effort to provide users with documentation that is more accessible.

== Whonix Quick Start ==

Newcomers to Whonix are recommended to first start reading:

* [https://www.whonix.org/download/ Whonix Installation Guide].
* [[Windows_Quick_Start|Windows Quick Start Guide]].
* [[FAQ|Whonix FAQ]].


If possible, have the [[Download|relevant installation guide]] for Qubes, VirtualBox or KVM on hand when first installing Whonix. It will answer many questions and help users to quickly install, start and update a functional Whonix system for their relevant platform. Users might later want to go through:

* The [[Documentation|Whonix Administrator’s Handbook]] - the comprehensive user manual.
* [[Whonix_Release_Notes|Whonix Release Notes]] - for users who are upgrading.
