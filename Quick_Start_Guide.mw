== Documentation ==

Documentation is critical to the correct operation and maintenance of the {{project name}} OS. Further, technical manuals describe the operation and use of programs, and how to set up specialist configurations.

In an effort to create a high-quality, usable and stable OS, the {{project name}} community is making every effort to provide users with documentation that is more accessible.
