== Installation Steps ==

{{Box|text=
'''Note:''' The following instructions should be applied in {{workstation_product_name}} ([[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]]: <code>anon-whonix</code>).

'''1.''' {{Open_a _product_ws_terminal}}

'''2.''' Import the gpg public key of Electrum developer Thomas Voegtlin. <ref>
https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/4789
</ref>

{{gpg key
|url=scurl-download https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spesmilo/electrum/master/pubkeys/ThomasV.asc

|gpg_fingerprint_output=

In early-2019, the output is identical to the following image.

}}

'''3.''' Download the Electrum AppImage.

<u>Note:</u> At the time of writing, <code>electrum-4.1.5</code> was the latest stable release. Before starting the Electrum download, browse to [https://electrum.org/#download electrum.org/#download] to verify the correct file path. Then download the file with [[Secure_Downloads#Downloads_with_scurl_-_SSL_Command_Line_Downloader|scurl]]. <ref>To find the correct image download: <i><code>"Right-click"</code></i> <code>AppImage</code> &rarr; <i><code>"Select"</i> Copy Link Location</code> &rarr; <i><code>Append</i> to scurl command</code>.</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
scurl-download https://download.electrum.org/4.1.5/electrum-4.1.5-x86_64.AppImage
}}

'''5.''' Check the Electrum AppImage is not corrupted after download. <ref>Due to recent DDoS attacks.</ref>

To check the Electrum AppImage, run.

{{CodeSelect|code= 
file electrum-3.*x86_64.AppImage 
}}

The following output indicates a corrupted and/or non-existent AppImage file.
<pre>
electrum-4.1.5-x86_64.AppImage: HTML document, ASCII text, with very long lines
</pre>

In that case, delete the file and try downloading the AppImage again.

'''6.''' Download the corresponding gpg signature.

It is necessary to verify the integrity of the AppImage with the correct signature.

<u>Note:</u> If users downloaded a later Electrum version at <i>step 4</i>, then modify the following command to match the corresponding signature file. <ref>To find the correct signature file download: <i><code>"Right-click"</i> signature</code> &rarr; <i><code>"Select"</i> Copy Link Location</code> &rarr; <i><code>"Append"</i> to scurl command</code></ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
scurl-download https://download.electrum.org/4.1.5/electrum-4.1.5-x86_64.AppImage.asc
}}
 
'''7.''' Verify the integrity of the AppImage image.

<u>Note:</u> This command must be run in the same directory as the downloaded AppImage and signature.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --verify electrum-4.1.5-x86_64.AppImage.asc
}}

If the image is verified successfully, the output will show a "Good signature" similar to the screenshot below. 

'''Figure:''' ''Good Signature'' <ref>
<pre>
gpg: assuming signed data in 'electrum-4.1.5-x86_64.AppImage'
gpg: Signature made Thu 16 May 2019 02:14:30 PM EDT

gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.

</pre>
</ref>

[[Image:electrum_gpg_good_signature.png]]

The above "gpg: WARNING" can be ignored since it does not alter the validity of the signature related to the downloaded key. Rather, this warning refers to the level of trust placed in the developers signing key and the web of trust. To remove this warning, the developers signing key must be personally signed with your own key.

If the following "gpg: BAD signature" message appears, the Appimage has been corrupted or altered during the download process.

'''Figure:''' ''Bad Signature''

[[Image:Electrum_bad_gpg_signature.png]]

In this event, delete both the AppImage and signature and either wait 10-15 minutes for the Tor circuits to change, or open up the [[Tor_Controller#Nyx|Nyx Tor Controller]] in {{gateway_product_name}} ([[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]]: <code>sys-whonix</code>) and type "n" to create new Tor circuits. Wait for a random period of time before repeating the steps to download the AppImage and signature.

'''8.''' Change file permissions.

Make the electrum AppImage executable.

{{CodeSelect|code=
chmod +x electrum-4.1.5-x86_64.AppImage
}}
}}

= Start Electrum =
{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = Users should create a wallet with a [[Passwords#Generating_Unbreakable_Passwords|strong password]]!
}}
Please refer to the official Documentation at [http://docs.electrum.org docs.electrum.org] for comprehensive instructions, as well as more advanced topics like [http://docs.electrum.org/en/latest/coldstorage.html Cold Storage] of private keys.

To start Electrum on all platforms, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
./electrum-4.1.5-x86_64.AppImage
}}

[[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]] users are recommended to configure a [https://qubes-os.org//doc/split-bitcoin/ Split Bitcoin Wallet] to better protect their private keys. To protect against identity correlation through Tor circuit sharing, follow the instructions below (see [[Stream_Isolation|Stream Isolation]] for more information).

'''1.''' Configure a manual server connection.

When Electrum is started for the first time, users are met with the prompt: <code>"How do you want to connect to a server?"</code>. 

Choose <code>Select server manually</code> and press <code>Next</code>.

'''Figure:''' ''Server Setting''

[[Image:Electrum_select_server_manually.png]]

'''2.''' Change the proxy settings.

The necessary settings are:

* Proxy: <code>SOCKS5</code>
* Host: <code>10.152.152.10</code>
* Port: <code>9111</code>

Press <code>Next</code> and the application should be fully functional.

'''Figure:''' ''SOCKS5 Proxy Configuration''
