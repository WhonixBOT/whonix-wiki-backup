= Connectivity Troubleshooting =
== Basic Connectivity Troubleshooting Steps ==

In case of connectivity issues:

'''1.''' "Forget" about {{Project name}} for a moment and imagine you had never heard of the platform. Test your host computer first.

'''2.''' Test if the host internet connection is functional. <ref>
By using ping.

For example, ping <code>8.8.8.8</code>..

On the host, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
ping google.com
}}

Ping <code>google.com</code> and other websites.

{{CodeSelect|code=
ping google.com
}}

and so on.
</ref>

Open different websites such as <code>whonix.org</code> in a host web browser.

'''3.''' Check the date and time. <ref>
{{CodeSelect|code=
date
}}
</ref>

Check if the host clock time and date has accuracy of up to ± 30 minutes. If the host clock is more than 1 hour in the past or more than 3 hours in the future, Tor cannot connect. ([[Network Time Synchronization|details]])

If not, fix host clock and reboot VM.

'''4.''' [[timezone|Do not change system timezone setting.]]

'''5.''' Run [[whonixcheck]].

To verify that the {{project_name}} system is up-to-date and that everything is in proper working order.
 
# Check if [https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en Tor Browser] works on the host. Reason: [[Network Obstacle]]
# Check if other virtual machines have Internet connectivity, such as newly created ones or those from a different vendor.

Information pertaining to these points should be included in any [[Support|support]] request or [[Reporting_Bugs|bug report]].

== Clock Fix ==
Broken internet connectivity is to be expected if the clock is incorrect. At all times it is recommended to have a host clock with accuracy of up to ± 30 minutes.

Quote {{project name}} [[Post Install Advice]]:

<blockquote>To protect against time zone leaks, the system clock inside {{project name}} is set to UTC. This means it may be a few hours before or ahead of your host system clock. <u>Do not change this setting!</u></blockquote>

See [[Network_Time_Synchronization#Manually_Set_Clock_Time_and_Date|Manually Set Clock Time and Date]].

== Clearnet Connectivity Test ==

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text    = '''Warning:''' The following test might reveal the {{project_name}} platform is in use. If that is a valid concern, then omit this step.
}}

It is possible to check if a non-torified, non-anonyomus, direct connection to check.torproject.org is functional. <ref>This test only uses TCP and not DNS.</ref>

On {{gateway_product_name}}, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo -u clearnet {{Curl Plain}} {{Curl Secure}} -H 'Host: check.torproject.org' -k https://{{Check.torproject.org IP}} | grep IP
}}

== General Virtualizer Connectivity Test ==
If networking is unavailable inside {{project_name}}, then try:

# Installing an operating system in a non-{{project_name}} virtual machine or downloading a regular image without Tor enforcement.
# Testing network functionality in a freshly downloaded non-{{project_name}} virtual machine.

If networking is still not functional, then {{project_name}} will not work either. The user must first resolve this issue, which might require re-installation of the virtualizer, followed by a reboot and further connectivity test(s).

If networking is functional, then users should note that networking is working in non-{{project_name}} VMs as part of the support request or bug report.

== Qubes-specific Connectivity Issue ==
Complete the following steps:

# Shut down <code>sys-whonix</code>. 
# Change the <code>sys-whonix</code> NetVM setting from <code>sys-firewall</code> to <code>sys-net</code>.
# Restart </code>sys-whonix</code>. 

This procedure might help, but should not be considered a final solution. <ref>This procedure was useful for [[Qubes|{{q_project_name}}]] R3.2 users, although the Qubes bug report is now resolved: https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/2141</ref>

= General Troubleshooting =

== Basic Troubleshooting Steps ==
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' "Forget" about {{Project name}} for a moment and imagine you had never heard of the platform. Test your host computer first.

'''4.''' Linux users only: The following command should not show any errors. <ref name=lengthy_test>
This process can be lengthy.
</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo dpkg-reconfigure -a
}}

'''5.''' Linux users only: The following command should be silent and not show any errors or output at all. <ref name=lengthy_test />

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo dpkg --configure -a
}}

'''6.''' Linux users only: Next attempt to retrieve all available updates.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
}}

'''7.''' Download the Tor Browser Bundle from [https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en torproject.org] and test if it is working on the host.

Follow one of the methods outlined in [[Install_Tor_Browser_Outside_of_{{project_name_short}}|Non-{{project_name}} Tor Browser]].

If the Tor Browser Bundle is not functional on the host, then {{project_name}} is unlikely to work either. It is recommended to have a recent Tor Browser Bundle version installed at all times. This way users can test if they live in a censored area or not and whether Tor is blocked by the ISP. Further, if (private) (obfuscated) [[bridges]] are necessary for Tor Browser Bundle functionality on the host, then {{project_name}} will similarly require them.
}}

== Low RAM Issues ==

When available RAM is insufficient to meet the {{project_name}} VM requirements, problems can emerge which make the VM(s) unusable. Factors that commonly contribute to low RAM issues in {{project_name}} include: 

* Unnecessary processes running and/or multi-tasking on the host OS.
* Multiple browser tabs being open.
* Unnecessary processes running in the {{project_name}} VM(s).
* Allocating more RAM to the {{project_name}} VM than is available; this prevents the VM from booting. 
* Insufficient RAM allocated to the {{project_name}} VM(s).
* Other non-{{project_name}} VMs running in parallel.

While insufficient RAM can cause a host of issues, behaviors most commonly seen with low memory resources include:

* Applications are slow or unresponsive.
* The virtual machine, mouse and/or keyboard freeze.
* Scrolling causes window staggers or jumps.
* Issues become worse when additional browser tabs or processes are spawned.
* Overall performance is poor.

See also [[RAM|Advice for Systems with Low RAM]].

=== Free up Additional Memory Resources ===

If additional memory is needed for the virtual machine, then free up resources and/or add more RAM to the virtual machine:

* Terminate any non-essential processes on the host.
* Shutdown any non-essential VMs.
* Shutdown and/or close non-essential processes and browser tabs in {{project_name}} VMs. 
* [[{{non q project name short}}|{{non q project name}}]] only: If low memory issues are experienced in {{workstation_product_name}}, additional resources can be freed by reducing RAM in {{gateway_product_name}} with [[RAM_Adjusted_Desktop_Starter|rads]].

To add additional RAM to the {{project_name}} VM(s), follow the platform-specific advice below.

=== KVM ===
{{KVM RAM}}

=== [[Qubes|{{q_project_name}}]] ===

Utilize Qube Manager: <br />
* <code>Qube Manager</code> &rarr; <code>VM_name</code> &rarr; <code>Qubes s<u>e</u>ttings</code> &rarr; <code>Advanced</code> &rarr; <code>Max memory:</code> <code><i>mem_size</i></code>

=== VirtualBox ===

# To add RAM in VirtualBox the VM <u>must</u> first be powered down. 
# <code>Virtual machine</code> &rarr; <code>Menu</code> &rarr; <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code><i>Adjust</i></code> <code>Memory slider</code> &rarr; <code><i>Hit:</i> OK</code>

See also [[VirtualBox/Troubleshooting]].

== Why can't I Ping the {{gateway_product_name}}? ==

The {{gateway_product_name}} does not respond to ping or similar commands because it is firewalled for security reasons; see ''{{W_Firewall}}'' or refer to the {{project name}} source code. In most cases it is unnecessary to ping the {{gateway_product_name}} anyhow.

If you insist on pinging the {{gateway_product_name}} or have a unique setup that requires it, then this can be tested by clearing all firewall rules with the [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/whonix-developer-meta-files/blob/master/dangerous_scripts/dev_clearnet dev_clearnet] script. Alternatively, a script can be run to try and [[Dev/Firewall_Unload|unload / remove every iptables rule]], or the {{project name}} firewall can be hacked to not load at all. The latter method is only for experts and it is necessary to comment out ''exit 0'' at the beginning.

= System Logs =
<ref>
"user support template": https://forums.whonix.org/t/workstation-keeps-freezing/7693/6
</ref>

== Check Systemd Journal Log of Current Boot ==
To inspect the systemd journal log of the current boot, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo journalctl -b
}}

This command requires pressing arrow keys like &uarr;, &darr;, &larr;, &rarr;, as well as <code>PgUp</code> and <code>PgDn</code> for scrolling.

For convenient reading of the log (until the command is issued), the log can be dumped to file. For example, the following command would write the log to file <code>~/systemd-log</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo journalctl -b > ~/systemd-log
}}

Use any available editor to read the log file, such as <code>mousepad</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
mousepad ~/systemd-log
}}

== Watch Systemd Journal Log of Current Boot ==
It is possible to to watch the systemd journal log as it is written. 

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo journalctl -b -f
}}

== Enable Persistent Systemd Journal Log ==
By default, a persistent systemd journal log is not enabled in Debian. <ref>
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=801906
</ref> To enable persistent systemd journal log, apply the following steps.

Platform specific notes:

* <u>Non-Qubes-Whonix</u>: No special steps are required. Follow steps below as is.
* <u>Qubes users</u>: The following changes must be applied in a VM with a persistent root image such as TemplateVM or StandaloneVM. It could be confusing if applied in TemplateBasedVMs since the systemd journal log might be mixed up with boots by the TemplateVM, while the AppVM systemd journal logs would not be persistent. [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/bind-dirs/ bind-dirs] might be helpful, but that requires further research.

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Create folder <code>/etc/systemd/journald.conf.d</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/journald.conf.d
}}

'''2.''' {{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/60_persistent_journal.conf
}}

'''3.''' Add the following setting.

{{CodeSelect|code=
[Journal]
Storage=persistent
}}

Save.

'''4.''' Restart <code>systemd-journald</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald
}}

A persistent systemd journal log has now been enabled.
}}

== Check Systemd Journal Log of Previous Boot ==
After following the [[#Enable Persistent Systemd Journal Log|Enable Persistent Systemd Journal Log]] steps, it is possible to inspect the systemd journal log of the previous boot.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo journalctl -b -1
}}

This command requires pressing arrow keys like &uarr;, &darr;, &larr;, &rarr;, as well as <code>PgUp</code> and <code>PgDn</code> for scrolling.

For convenient reading of the log until the time of issuing the command, the log can be dumped to file. For example, the following command would write the log to file <code>~/systemd-log-previous</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo journalctl -b -1 > ~/systemd-log-previous
}}

Use any available editor to read the log file, such as <code>mousepad</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
mousepad ~/systemd-log-previous
}}

== Check Systemd Journal Log of Failed Boot ==
An easier and more lightweight solution as alternative to recovery mode might be [[Desktop#Virtual_Consoles|virtual consoles]]. If the graphical user interface is no longer starting, login to a virtual console might still be possible.

Prerequisite knowledge: [[Desktop#Virtual Consoles|Virtual Consoles]]. Try to login in a virtual console in a functional VM (virtual machine) as an exercise. If that works, try login to virtual console in the broken VM.

In case no virtual console is available:

'''1.''' Boot into [[Recovery|Recovery Mode]].

'''2.''' [[#Enable_Persistent_Systemd_Journal_Log|Enable Persistent Systemd Journal Log]] (If not already previously enabled persistent systemd journal log.)

'''3.''' Reboot into normal mode so a log for the failed boot will be written. (If not already previously enabled persistent systemd journal log.)

'''4.''' Boot again into recovery mode.

= Permission Fix =

Tip: If something does not work, do not arbitrarily try to use sudo / root without indication that this would be appropriate. That only risks messing up user home folder permissions. See also [[root|Safely Use Root Commands]].

{{Open a product ws terminal}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo chown --recursive user:user /home/user
}}

= Hardware Issues =
Rhetoric questions:

* When was the last time a qualified person disassembled your computer or notebook and removed dust from the fan and checked the cooling system of your CPU?
* How often such maintenance should be done?
* What is your CPU temperature under heavy system load?
* What is the temperature is it in the room?

Recommendations:

* Make sure your computer or notebook had the proper maintenance.
* Monitor CPU temperature. There are tools for your host operating system showing the temperature of your CPU.
* Cooling the room might help.
* Better placement (more air space) of your computer or notebook.
* Consider a passive or active (notebook) cooling pad. Do you own research.
* Run [[#memtest86+|<code>memtest86+</code>]].

None of these issues are {{Project name}} issues. Therefore please do not ask thees questions at {{Project name}} support (until there is a Whonix-Host operating system) as per [[Free Support Principle]].

= memtest86+ =
'''1)''' Tool installation.

On Debian (based) hosts such as [[Kicksecure]].

{{Install Package|package=
memtest86+
}}

For other host operating systems, refer to <code>memtest86+</code> upstream documentation.

'''2)''' Reboot.

'''3)''' Start <code>memtest86+</code> from (grub) boot menu.

'''4)''' Keep <code>memtest86+</code> running for a long time.

As long as reasonably possibly. Ideally for example over night. For 8+ hours.

'''5)''' See what <code>memtest86+</code> is saying.

Should there be any issues, there will be red colored error messages in the middle of the screen.

'''6)''' Done.

Memory test complete.

Should <code>memtest86+</code> have found any issues, these can manifest in many other ways such as system crashes at random times. In such cases, there is probably no other way to fix this than replacing the faulty hardware (RAM banks). Perhaps (lifetime) RAM bank warranty applies.
