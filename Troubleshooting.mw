= Introduction =

The following steps summarize basic troubleshooting instructions, which are described in greater detail below. In basic terms:

# [[Non-Qubes-Whonix]] only: [[Verify_the_Whonix_images|Verify the Whonix virtual machine images]] if this has step has not previously been completed.
# Ensure the virtual machine images have been imported into a supported virtualizer.
# Check if [https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en Tor Browser] works on the host.
# Check if other virtual machines have Internet connectivity, such as newly created ones or those from a different vendor.

Information pertaining to these points should be included in any support request or bug report.

= Troubleshooting Steps =

== General ==

It is recommended to first test if the host Internet connection is functional by using ping. <ref>For example, ping 8.8.8.8, ping google.com and so on.</ref> On the host, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
ping google.com
}}

Check the date and time.

{{CodeSelect|code=
date
}}

The following command should not show any errors. <ref name=lengthy_test>This process can be lengthy.</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo dpkg-reconfigure -a
}}

The following command should be silent and not show any errors or output at all. <ref name=lengthy_test />

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo dpkg --configure -a
}}

Next attempt to retrieve all available updates.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
}}

Download the Tor Browser Bundle from [https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en torproject.org] and test if it is working on the host. To do this, follow one of the methods outlined in [[Install_Tor_Browser_Outside_of_Whonix|Non-Whonix Tor Browser]].

If the Tor Browser Bundle is not functional on the host, then Whonix is unlikely to work either. It is recommended to have a recent Tor Browser Bundle version installed at all times. This way users can test if they live in a censored area or not and whether Tor is blocked by the ISP. Further, if (private) (obfuscated) bridges are necessary for Tor Browser Bundle functionality on the host, then Whonix will similarly require them.

== Whonix Network Connectivity Problems ==

If networking is unavailable inside Whonix, then try:

# Installing an operating system in a non-Whonix virtual machine or downloading a regular image without Tor enforcement.
# Testing network functionality in a freshly downloaded non-Whonix virtual machine.

If networking is still not functional, then Whonix will not work either. The user must first resolve this issue, which might require re-installation of the virtualizer, followed by a reboot and further connectivity test.

If networking is functional, then users should note that networking is working in non-Whonix VMs as part of the support request or bug report.

== whonixcheck ==

Run [[whonixcheck]] to verify that the Whonix system is up-to-date and that everything is in proper working order.

== Clock Fix ==

The first step should be completed on the host to ensure the host clock is set to the correct time.

On the host ([[Qubes-Whonix]]: <code>dom0</code>), run the following command to report the time in UTC.

<pre>
date -u
</pre>

The output should be similar to the following.

<pre>
Sun Jul 14 04:30:44 UTC 2018
</pre>

To set the correct time in Whonix-Gateway (<code>sys-whonix</code>), run the following command with the correct date and time parameters.

<pre>
sudo date --set "Sun Jul 14 04:30:44 UTC 2018"
</pre>

Tor should work once correct clock values are set, but that can be manually tested with [[whonixcheck]].

Next restart sdwdate.

<pre>
sudo service sdwdate restart
</pre>

If Tor is still not functional, try restarting Tor.

<pre>
sudo service tor restart
</pre>

== Clearnet Connectivity Test ==

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text       = '''Warning:''' The following test might reveal the Whonix platform is in use. If that is a valid concern, then omit this step.
}}


Users can check if a non-torified, non-anonyomus, direct connection to check.torproject.org is functional. <ref>This test only uses TCP and not DNS.</ref>

On Whonix-Gateway, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo -u clearnet {{Curl Plain}} {{Curl Secure}} -H 'Host: check.torproject.org' -k https://{{Check.torproject.org IP}} | grep IP
}}

== Qubes-specific ==

=== Connectivity Issue ===

Complete the following steps:

# Shut down <code>sys-whonix</code>. 
# Change the <code>sys-whonix</code> NetVM setting from <code>sys-firewall</code> to <code>sys-net</code>.
# Restart </code>sys-whonix</code>. 

This procedure might help, but should not be considered a final solution. <ref>This procedure was useful for Qubes-Whonix R3.2 users, although the Qubes bug report is now resolved: https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/2141</ref>
