= Introduction =

The following steps summarize basic troubleshooting instructions, which are described in greater detail below. In basic terms:

# [[{{non q project name short}}|{{non q project name}}]] only: [[Verify_the_Whonix_images|Verify the Whonix virtual machine images]] if this has step has not previously been completed.
# Ensure the virtual machine images have been imported into a supported virtualizer.
# Check if [https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en Tor Browser] works on the host.
# Check if other virtual machines have Internet connectivity, such as newly created ones or those from a different vendor.

Information pertaining to these points should be included in any support request or bug report.

= Troubleshooting Steps =

== General ==

It is recommended to first test if the host Internet connection is functional by using ping. <ref>For example, ping 8.8.8.8, ping google.com and so on.</ref> On the host, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
ping google.com
}}

Check the date and time.

{{CodeSelect|code=
date
}}

The following command should not show any errors. <ref name=lengthy_test>This process can be lengthy.</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo dpkg-reconfigure -a
}}

The following command should be silent and not show any errors or output at all. <ref name=lengthy_test />

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo dpkg --configure -a
}}

Next attempt to retrieve all available updates.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
}}

Download the Tor Browser Bundle from [https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en torproject.org] and test if it is working on the host; follow one of the methods outlined in [[Install_Tor_Browser_Outside_of_Whonix|Non-Whonix Tor Browser]].

If the Tor Browser Bundle is not functional on the host, then Whonix is unlikely to work either. It is recommended to have a recent Tor Browser Bundle version installed at all times. This way users can test if they live in a censored area or not and whether Tor is blocked by the ISP. Further, if (private) (obfuscated) bridges are necessary for Tor Browser Bundle functionality on the host, then Whonix will similarly require them.

== Whonix Network Connectivity Problems ==

If networking is unavailable inside {{project_name}}, then try:

# Installing an operating system in a non-Whonix virtual machine or downloading a regular image without Tor enforcement.
# Testing network functionality in a freshly downloaded non-Whonix virtual machine.

If networking is still not functional, then Whonix will not work either. The user must first resolve this issue, which might require re-installation of the virtualizer, followed by a reboot and further connectivity test(s).

If networking is functional, then users should note that networking is working in non-Whonix VMs as part of the support request or bug report.

== whonixcheck ==

Run [[whonixcheck]] to verify that the Whonix system is up-to-date and that everything is in proper working order.

== Clock Fix ==

The first step should be completed on the host to ensure the host clock is set to the correct time.

On the host ([[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]]: <code>dom0</code>), run the following command to report the time in UTC.

<pre>
date -u
</pre>

The output should be similar to the following.

<pre>
Mon Apr 22 04:30:44 UTC 2019
</pre>

To set the correct time in Whonix-Gateway (<code>sys-whonix</code>), run the following command with the correct date and time parameters.

<pre>
sudo date --set "Mon Apr 22 04:30:44 UTC 2019"
</pre>

Tor should work once correct clock values are set, but that can be manually tested with [[whonixcheck]].

Next restart sdwdate.

<pre>
sudo service sdwdate restart
</pre>

If Tor is still not functional, try restarting Tor.

<pre>
sudo service tor restart
</pre>

== Clearnet Connectivity Test ==

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text       = '''Warning:''' The following test might reveal the Whonix platform is in use. If that is a valid concern, then omit this step.
}}


Users can check if a non-torified, non-anonyomus, direct connection to check.torproject.org is functional. <ref>This test only uses TCP and not DNS.</ref>

On Whonix-Gateway, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo -u clearnet {{Curl Plain}} {{Curl Secure}} -H 'Host: check.torproject.org' -k https://{{Check.torproject.org IP}} | grep IP
}}

== Qubes-specific ==

=== Connectivity Issue ===

Complete the following steps:

# Shut down <code>sys-whonix</code>. 
# Change the <code>sys-whonix</code> NetVM setting from <code>sys-firewall</code> to <code>sys-net</code>.
# Restart </code>sys-whonix</code>. 

This procedure might help, but should not be considered a final solution. <ref>This procedure was useful for Qubes-Whonix R3.2 users, although the Qubes bug report is now resolved: https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/2141</ref>

== Low RAM Issues ==

When inadequate RAM is available to meet the Whonix VM requirements, problems can emerge which make the VM(s) unusable. Factors that commonly contribute to low RAM issues in Whonix include: 

* Unnecessary processes running and/or multi-tasking on the host OS.
* Multiple browser tabs being open.
* Unnecessary processes running in the Whonix VM(s).
* Allocating more RAM to the Whonix VM than is available; this prevents the VM from booting. 
* Insufficient RAM allocated to the Whonix VM(s).
* Other non-Whonix VMs running in parallel.

While insufficient RAM can cause a host of issues, behaviors most commonly seen with low memory resources include:

* Applications are slow or unresponsive.
* The virtual machine, mouse and/or keyboard freeze.
* Scrolling causes window staggers or jumps.
* Issues become worse when additional browser tabs or processes are spawned.
* Overall performance is poor.

=== Free up Additional Memory Resources ===

If additional memory is needed for the virtual machine, users can free up resources and/or add more RAM to the virtual machine:

* Terminate any non-essential processes on the host.
* Shutdown any non-essential VMs.
* Shutdown and/or close non-essential processes and browser tabs in Whonix VMs. 
* [[{{non q project name short}}|{{non q project name}}]] only: If users are experiencing low memory issues in Whonix-Workstation, additional resources can be freed by reducing RAM in Whonix-Gateway with [[RAM_Adjusted_Desktop_Starter|rads]].

To add additional RAM to the Whonix VM(s), follow the platform-specific advice below.

=== KVM ===

# Shutdown the virtual machine(s). {{CodeSelect|code=
virsh -c qemu:///system shutdown <vm_name>
}}
# Increase maximum memory. {{CodeSelect|code=
virsh setmaxmem <vm_name> <memsize> --config
}}
# Set actual memory. {{CodeSelect|code=
virsh setmem <vm_name> <memsize> --config
}}
# Restart the virtual machine(s). {{CodeSelect|code=
virsh -c qemu:///system start <vm_name>
}}

=== Qubes-Whonix ===

Utilize Qube Manager: <br />
* <code>Qube Manager</code> -> <code>VM_name</code> -> <code>Qubes s<u>e</u>ttings</code> -> <code>Advanced</code> -> <code>Max memory:</code> <code><i>mem_size</i></code>

=== VirtualBox ===

# To add RAM in VirtualBox the VM <u>must</u> first be powered down. 
# <code>Virtual machine</code> -> <code>Menu</code> -> <code>Settings</code> -> <code><i>Adjust</i></code> <code>Memory slider</code> -> <code><i>Hit:</i> OK</code>
