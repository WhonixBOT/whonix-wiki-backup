{{Release Upgrade}}

For the latest instructions on a release upgrade from Whonix 13 to Whonix 14, see [[Upgrading_Whonix_13_to_Whonix_14|here]].

An [[Upgrade]] makes sure all packages within a major release are up-to-date. In contrast, a release upgrade upgrades from one major version to another.

Due to technical limitations, a standard ("everyday") upgrade cannot perform the same functions as a release upgrade. The latter procedure upgrades a far greater number of packages, often removes select packages and requires the user to apply extra steps as per release upgrade documentation.
