{{Release Upgrade}}

For the latest release upgrade instructions from Whonix 13 to Whonix 14 please refer to:<br />
[[Upgrading_Whonix_13_to_Whonix_14|Upgrading Whonix 13 to Whonix 14]]

A [[Upgrade]] makes sure all packages within a major release are made up to date. A release upgrade upgrades from one major version to another.

Due to technical limitations an every day upgrade cannot cover a release upgrade due to the much greater amount of packages upgraded and because often at release upgrades some packages were removed.
