{{Release Upgrade}}

For the latest instructions on a release upgrade from {{project name}} 14 to {{project name}} 15, see [[Upgrading_{{project_name_short}}_14_to_{{project_name_short}}_15|here]].

An Standard [[Upgrade]] makes sure all packages within a major release are up-to-date. In contrast, a Release Upgrade upgrades from one major version to another.

Due to technical limitations, a standard ("everyday") upgrade cannot perform the same functions as a release upgrade. The latter procedure upgrades a far greater number of packages, often removes select packages and requires the user to apply extra steps as per release upgrade documentation.

What is better? Upgrade or Image Re-Installation? See [[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates#Upgrade_vs_Image_Re-Installation|Upgrade vs Image Re-Installation]].
