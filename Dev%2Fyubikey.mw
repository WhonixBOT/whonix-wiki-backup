yubikey info:

- Configured yubikey configuration slot 1 with static password and configured yubkkey configuration slot 2 with challenge response. (google) U2F still working. Pretty awesome.

- Could even enter my BIOS password using yubikey using a static yubikey password.

- Static password works even for full disk encryption password entry. Either as a single factor or to increase the lenght of the password. It acts as a USB keyboard. Even works with Qubes. (2FA vs BadUSB.)

- Yubikey U2F - no backup possible. (But U2F supporting services might support alternative login methods or multiple U2F (yubikey) keys.) Not an issue, since we won't be using yubikey for U2F.

- Yubikey static passwords / HMAC-SHA1 challenge response: (paper) backup easily possible.

- It might have a bug resetting keyboard layout to en-US but it's not a big deal.

- Yubikeys supports storing OpenPGP (GnuPG / gpg) keys, OpenSSH keys, but I wouldn't trust it. Another yubikey model had a PIN bypass bug. ( https://developers.yubico.com/ykneo-openpgp/SecurityAdvisory%202015-04-14.html )
