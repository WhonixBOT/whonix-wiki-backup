= Introduction =

It is possible to optionally set the virtual machine (VM) disks to read-only. This increases the security of the VM Live Mode configuration, because otherwise malware running as root in the VM could theoretically mount the image read-write and gain persistence in this way.

= Read-only Mode Configuration=

== Qubes ==

<code>grub-live</code> is currently [[unsupported]] on [[Qubes]], but may become available in the future. Refer to the following [https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-live-mode/3894/31 forum discussion] for further information.

In Qubes R4, [[Qubes/DisposableVM|Qubes DisposableVMs]] are a suitable alternative, as well as the [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/live-usb/ Qubes Live USB].

'''1.''' Set the VM disks to read-only.

Follow these steps: 

* Power off the virtual machine (VM).
* Set the disk to read-only. 
** The name of the VM in the following example below is <code>{{workstation_product_name_short}}-XFCE</code>. It could be replaced with the name of any other VM such as <code>{{gateway_product_name_short}}-XFCE</code>.
** On the host, on the command line, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
VBoxManage setextradata {{workstation_product_name_short}}-XFCE "VBoxInternal/Devices/lsilogicsas/0/LUN#0/AttachedDriver/Config/ReadOnly" 1
}}

'''2.''' Remove VirtualBox virtual DVD drive.

Only required the the VM has a virtual DVD drive. Not required in {{Project name}} version <code>15.0.1.2.7</code> and above since it no longer comes with a virtual DVD drive by default. See footnote for {{Project name}} build version lower than <code>15.0.1.2.7</code>. <ref>

</ref>

'''3.''' Launch the live system.

Following reboot, a second boot entry called "VM Live Mode-mode" will be visible. Choose it. Then press <code>Enter</code> to boot the live system and use it as normal.

'''4.''' ''Optional:'' Revert the read-only change. 

To boot into normal mode again, run this command on the host to revert the change.

{{CodeSelect|code=
VBoxManage setextradata {{workstation_product_name_short}}-XFCE "VBoxInternal/Devices/lsilogicsas/0/LUN#0/AttachedDriver/Config/ReadOnly"
}}

The normal boot option can now be selected in the GRUB menu.

'''5.''' ''Optional:'' Re-add virtual DVD .

Only when you need this; see footnotes. <ref>

Troubleshooting: If system does not boot, make sure you are using the [[VirtualBox/Recommended_Version|Recommended VirtualBox Version]] for {{Project name}} VirtualBox. <ref>
A user reported on telegram that upgrading VirtualBox fixed this an issue which preventing booting the system in read-only mode.
