= Introduction =
Security is not a checklist. Security is not about making websites show a lot green and no red at all. The context is important.

See also [[Privacy Policy Technical Details]], [[Trust#Trusting_the_{{project_name}}_.E2.84.A2_Website|Trusting the {{project_name}} Website]] and [[Trust#Distrusting_Infrastructure|Distrusting Infrastructure]].

= Email DANE =
<blockquote>Email DANE (SMTP)

DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) is a bridge between DNSSEC and TLS. In one possible scenario, DANE can be used for public key pinning, building on an existing publicly-trusted certificate. In another approach, it can be used to completely bypass the CA ecosystem and establish trust using DNSSEC alone.
Feature not implemented or disabled
Your server doesn't support this feature.</blockquote>

The <code>{{project_clearnet}}</code> website doesn't offer free or paid e-mail accounts. The extend in which <code>{{project_clearnet}}</code> uses e-mail:

* Sends e-mails to wiki editors who signed up to be notified about changes.
* Forum e-mail sign-up and notifications.
* [[Mailing Lists]]
* Developer accounts.

Even if e-mail security was "perfected", even if the DANE test would pass on website tests, it should not be relied on DANE. Better use end-to-end encryption such as [[OpenPGP]] or even better such as [[codecrypt]].

= Content-Security-Policy CSP =
<code>{{project_clearnet}}</code> has an essential CSP. TODO: expand

= gzip =
Not security relevant. Performance only.

https://onionheaders.website shows gzip is disabled but checking with <code>curl</code> shows it is actually enabled. As per [https://davidwalsh.name/check-gzip curl gzip test instructions].

{{CodeSelect|code=
torsocks curl -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" --head http://dds6qkxpwdeubwucdiaord2xgbbeyds25rbsgr73tbfpqpt4a6vjwsyd.onion/wiki/Documentation
}}

Output includes.

<blockquote>

= Comparison with Others =
Before demanding what <code>{{project_clearnet}}</code> website ought to implement, and might not do yet due to lack of resources, please compare with much better funded organizations for a fair comparison.
