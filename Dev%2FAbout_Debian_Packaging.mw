= About Debian Packaging =
<code>debian/control</code>: There are separate meta packages for dependencies and recommended packages.

If we used the <code>Recommends:</code> field for Whonix meta packages (those who pull the required Debian upstream packages for creating Whonix), we could not install them using <code>apt-get</code> with <code>--install-recommends</code>, which is <code>apt-get</code>'s default option, because that would also install packages recommend by any dependency we install.

On the other hand, if we installed using apt-get <code>--no-install-recommends</code>, the packages Whonix's meta packages recommends, will not get installed.

Therefore splitting them, appeared to be the only solution. Otherwise it would install packages such as <code>virtuoso</code>, <code>soprano</code> and <code>vlc</code>, which are not useful '''in context of''' Whonix-Gateway.
