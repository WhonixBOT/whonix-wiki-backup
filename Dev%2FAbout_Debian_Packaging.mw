= Recommends vs Depends =
<code>debian/control</code>: There are separate meta packages for dependencies and recommended packages.

If we used the <code>Recommends:</code> field for Whonix meta packages (those who pull the required Debian upstream packages for creating Whonix), we could not install them using <code>apt-get</code> with <code>--install-recommends</code>, which is <code>apt-get</code>'s default option, because that would also install packages recommend by any dependency we install.

On the other hand, if we installed using apt-get <code>--no-install-recommends</code>, the packages Whonix's meta packages recommends, will not get installed.

Therefore splitting them, appeared to be the only solution. Otherwise it would install packages such as <code>virtuoso</code>, <code>soprano</code> and <code>vlc</code>, which are not useful '''in context of''' Whonix-Gateway.

= Files in Home Folder =
* Leads to a [[Whonix_Configuration_Files#dpkg_interactive_conflict_resolution_dialog]] when package file is updated.
* <code>serious</code> <code>lintian</code> error [https://lintian.debian.org/tags/dir-or-file-in-home.html <code>dir-or-file-in-home</code>].
** Makes the package unfit for inclusion into packages.debian.org (very long term goal) (or other distribution archives).
** Looks amateurish in the eyes of Debian packagers.
* For which user? User <code>user</code> only? Inconsistent for multi user use cases.
* Doesn't work / inconsistent in [https://www.qubes-os.org Qubes] TemplateBasedVMs. Since packages are usually upgraded in TemplateVMs, the change never propagates to the home folder of the TemplateBasedVM since it has an independently persistent home folder.
