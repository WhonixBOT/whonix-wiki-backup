= Supported Host Operating Systems =
Any operating system that can run a supported virtualizer can run Whonix, including Windows, Mac, BSD, and Linux. Most users get started by installing [[VirtualBox]] on their current operating system and importing the Whonix images.

Advanced users may wish to boot a host operating system (usually a Unix variant) dedicated solely to running the Whonix virtual machines.
