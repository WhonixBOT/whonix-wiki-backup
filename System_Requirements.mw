= Supported Host Operating Systems =
Any operating system that can run a supported virtualizer can run {{project_name}}, including Windows, macOS, BSD, and Linux. Most users get started by installing [[VirtualBox]] on their current operating system and importing the Whonix images. Advanced users may wish to boot a host operating system (usually a Unix variant) dedicated solely to running the Whonix virtual machines. 

For the best possible security, users can choose to run Whonix virtual machines on the Qubes platform (Qubes-Whonix). Qubes is a Xen-based hypervisor (virtualizer) that runs on the bare metal of the hardware instead of within a host operating system. <ref>This is more secure because an attacker must subvert the hypervisor, which is far more difficult than exploiting a host operating system.</ref>

= Supported Platforms =
{{Supported_Platforms}}

= {{non_q_project_name_short}} System Requirements =
== Minimum ==
* 1 GB free RAM - with Whonix-Gateway lowered to 256 MB. {{Minimum RAM}}
* 10 GB free hard drive space.

== Recommended ==
* Additional hard drive space when installing applications into the Whonix-Workstation.
* A CPU with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization#AMD_virtualization_.28AMD-V.29 AMD-V] or Intel [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization#Intel_virtualization_.28VT-x.29 VT-x].

== For Best Performance ==
* A solid state drive (SSD).
* Additional RAM to dedicate to the {{workstation_product_name}} when multitasking.

== Notes ==
* {{workstation_product_name}} can be run with 256 MB RAM when not using a desktop environment. {{Minimum RAM}}
* For low memory and console-only configurations, see [[Desktop#RAM_Adjusted_Desktop_Starter|Ram Adjusted Desktop Starter]].
* Systems without AMD-V or Intel VT-x might experience the PAE or "{{Code2|VERR_SSM_FIELD_NOT_CONSECUTIVE}}" error; please read [[VirtualBox/Troubleshooting#PAE_crash|PAE Crash]] for a workaround.
* Linux users with low RAM might save some host RAM if a lighter desktop environment like Xfce or LXDE is configured, rather than KDE, GNOME and other alternatives.

| text       = <blockquote>"Qubes can be installed on systems which do not meet the recommended requirements. Such systems will still offer significant security improvements over traditional operating systems, since things like GUI isolation and kernel protection do not require special hardware." <ref>https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/system-requirements/</ref></blockquote>
}}

== Minimum (Qubes 3.X) ==
* A 64-bit Intel or AMD processor - <code>x86_64</code> aka <code>x64</code> aka <code>AMD64</code>. <ref> Qubes system requirements are directly sourced from https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/system-requirements/</ref>
* 4 GB RAM.
* 32 GB disk space.
* Legacy boot mode - required for R3.0 and earlier; UEFI is supported beginning with R3.1

== Minimum (Qubes 4.X) ==
* As per Qubes 3.X minimum requirements above, ''plus'':
** Intel VT-x with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Level_Address_Translation#Extended_Page_Tables EPT] or AMD-V with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Level_Address_Translation#Rapid_Virtualization_Indexing RVI].
** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization#Intel-VT-d Intel VT-d] or [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization#I.2FO_MMU_virtualization_.28AMD-Vi_and_Intel_VT-d.29 AMD-Vi] (aka AMD IOMMU) - required for effective isolation of network VMs.

== Recommended ==
* A fast SSD - strongly recommended.
* Intel IGP - strongly preferred.
** Nvidia GPUs may require significant troubleshooting.
** ATI GPUs have not been formally tested, but see the [https://www.qubes-os.org/hcl/ Hardware Compatibility List].
* Intel VT-x or AMD-V - required for running [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/hvm/ HVM domains], such as Windows-based AppVMs.
* Intel VT-d or AMD-Vi (aka AMD IOMMU) - required for effective isolation of network VMs and [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/assigning-devices/ PCI passthrough].
* TPM with proper BIOS support - required for [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/anti-evil-maid/ Anti Evil Maid].
* 16 GB+ RAM minimum. 32 GB+ for power users. <ref>Users report problems in creating DisposableVMs and running multiple VMs in parallel with only 4 GB RAM. 8 GB RAM is nearly exhausted with {{q_project_name}} VMs running in parallel with the <code>sys-net</code>, <code>sys-firewall</code> and <code>sys-usb</code> AppVMs.</ref>
* A non-USB keyboard or multiple USB controllers to enable creation of a [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/usb/ USB VM]. <ref>To prevent malicious compromise of dom0 via USB mice, keyboards or other USB devices.</ref>
* Interrupt remapping - this helps resist potential (hypothetical) attacks coming from compromised driver domains like <code>sys-net</code> or <code>sys-usb</code>. <ref>https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/3208</ref>

Before purchasing any hardware specifically for Qubes, always check the [https://www.qubes-os.org/hcl/ hardware compatibility list (HCL)] first for suitable models. Without referring to the HCL, there is no guarantee that a computer supporting the above specifications will successfully install Qubes.

Joanna Rutkowska, [https://www.qubes-os.org/news/2018/10/25/thank-you-joanna/ Qubes founder and former project leader], stated in early-2018: <ref>https://twitter.com/rootkovska/status/959743157041811456</ref>

<blockquote>
BTW, our laptop of choice for Qubes 4.0 is Carbon X1 gen5. This is what most of the core team uses now, so we try to make sure it runs Qubes 4.0 smoothly. But keep in mind this is not an _officially_ supported model, i.e. we don't guarantee anything™, use at your own risk™
