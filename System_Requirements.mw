= Supported Host Operating Systems =
Any operating system that can run a supported virtualizer can run {{project_name}}, including Windows, macOS, BSD, and Linux. Most users get started by installing [[VirtualBox]] on their current operating system and importing the {{project_name}} images. Advanced users may wish to boot a host operating system (usually a Unix variant) dedicated solely to running the {{project_name}} virtual machines. 

For the best possible security, users can choose to run {{project_name}} virtual machines on the Qubes platform ({{q_project_name}}). Qubes is a Xen-based hypervisor (virtualizer) that runs on the bare metal of the hardware instead of within a host operating system. <ref>This is more secure because an attacker must subvert the hypervisor, which is far more difficult than exploiting a host operating system.</ref>

== Minimum (Qubes 4.X) ==
* 4 GB RAM.
* 32 GB disk space.
* A 64-bit Intel or AMD processor - <code>x86_64</code> aka <code>x64</code> aka <code>AMD64</code>. <ref> Qubes system requirements are directly sourced from https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/system-requirements/</ref>
** Intel VT-x with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Level_Address_Translation#Extended_Page_Tables EPT] or AMD-V with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Level_Address_Translation#Rapid_Virtualization_Indexing RVI]. <ref>This is required for running [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/hvm/ HVM domains], such as Windows-based AppVMs.</ref>
** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization#Intel-VT-d Intel VT-d] or [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization#I.2FO_MMU_virtualization_.28AMD-Vi_and_Intel_VT-d.29 AMD-Vi] (aka AMD IOMMU) - required for effective isolation of network VMs and [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/assigning-devices/ PCI passthrough].

== Recommended ==
* A fast SSD - strongly recommended.
* Intel IGP - strongly preferred.
** Nvidia GPUs may require significant troubleshooting.
** ATI GPUs have not been formally tested, but see the [https://www.qubes-os.org/hcl/ Hardware Compatibility List].
* TPM with proper BIOS support - required for [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/anti-evil-maid/ Anti Evil Maid].
* 16 GB+ RAM minimum. 32 GB+ for power users. <ref>Users report problems in creating DisposableVMs and running multiple VMs in parallel with only 4 GB RAM. 8 GB RAM is nearly exhausted with {{q_project_name}} VMs running in parallel with the <code>sys-net</code>, <code>sys-firewall</code> and <code>sys-usb</code> AppVMs.</ref>
* A non-USB keyboard or multiple USB controllers to enable creation of a [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/usb/ USB VM]. <ref>To prevent malicious compromise of dom0 via USB mice, keyboards or other USB devices.</ref>
* Interrupt remapping - this helps resist potential (hypothetical) attacks coming from compromised driver domains like <code>sys-net</code> or <code>sys-usb</code>. <ref>https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/3208</ref>

== Hardware Purchases ==

Before purchasing any hardware specifically for Qubes, consider [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/certified-laptops/ Qubes Certified Hardware], [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/hardware-testing/ Qubes Hardware Testing] or at least the [https://www.qubes-os.org/hcl/ hardware compatibility list (HCL)] for suitable models. Without referring to any of these, there is a chance that a computer without the above specifications will be incompatible with Qubes.

Also note the fairly priced [https://www.qubes-os.org/news/2019/07/18/insurgo-privacybeast-qubes-certification/ Insurgo PrivacyBeast X230] is the first custom, refurbished laptop to exceed all Qubes hardware certification requirements. <ref>
This includes:
* Binary-blob-free Coreboot initialization, including native graphic initialization.
* Heads provides an Anti-evil Maid (AEM) firmware solution and protects against malicious interdiction.
* Intel ME is neutered and unnecessary modules involved in main CPU initialization have been deleted.
* Ships with Qubes OS pre-installed (with full-disk encryption), with the final disk encryption key being regenerated when first powered on by the buyer.
