= Supported Host Operating Systems =
Any operating system that can run VirtualBox can run Whonix, including Windows, Mac, BSD, and Linux. Most users get started by installing VirtualBox on their current operating system and importing the Whonix images.

Advanced users may wish to boot a host operating system (usually a Unix variant) dedicated solely to running the Whonix virtual machines.

= System Requirements =
* For Whonix-Default-Download at least 1 GB free RAM is required. If you system has in total 2 GB RAM, Whonix should run fine. The more the better.
* CPU: AMD-V<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization#AMD_virtualization_.28AMD-V.29</ref> or Intel VT-x<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization#Intel_virtualization_.28VT-x.29</ref> would speed up Whonix a lot. If you do not have it and run into a PAE or "{{Code2|VERR_SSM_FIELD_NOT_CONSECUTIVE}}" error please read [[Starting Whonix#PAE crash|PAE Crash]] for workaround.
* 10 GB disk space, better 15 GB or 20 GB or more depending on what applications you like to install.
* See also [[Desktop#RAM_Adjusted_Desktop_Starter]].
* Minimum 1024x768 desktop resolution for terminal (before the desktop environment starts) set in {{Code2|/etc/default/grub}}, unless manually reduced.
* 128 MB RAM for Whonix-Gateway without graphical desktop environment. Or 768 MB RAM for Whonix-Gateway with graphical desktop environment
* 768 MB RAM for Whonix-Workstation with graphical desktop environment. (Or <ref>128 MB RAM for Whonix-Workstation without graphical desktop environment.</ref>.)
