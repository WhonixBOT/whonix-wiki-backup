= Supported Host Operating Systems =
Any operating system that can run a supported virtualizer can run {{project_name}}, including Windows, macOS, BSD, and Linux. Most users get started by installing [[VirtualBox]] on their current operating system and importing the {{project_name}} images. Advanced users may wish to boot a host operating system (usually a Unix variant) dedicated solely to running the {{project_name}} virtual machines. 

For the best possible security, users can choose to run {{project_name}} virtual machines on the Qubes platform ({{q_project_name}}). Qubes is a Xen-based hypervisor (virtualizer) that runs on the bare metal of the hardware instead of within a host operating system. <ref>This is more secure because an attacker must subvert the hypervisor, which is far more difficult than exploiting a host operating system.</ref>

= {{non_q_project_name_short}} System Requirements =
{{Non q project name}} includes {{Project name}} for [[VirtualBox]] and [[KVM]].

= {{q_project_name}} System Requirements =
{{q_project_name}} does not have any special system requirements on top of Qubes own system requirements. The user only must make sure fulfilling Qubes system requirements. Refer to the Qubes documentation.
