= Supported Host Operating Systems =
Any operating system that can run a supported virtualizer can run Whonix, including Windows, Mac, BSD, and Linux. Most users get started by installing [[VirtualBox]] on their current operating system and importing the Whonix images.

Advanced users may wish to boot a host operating system (usually a Unix variant) dedicated solely to running the Whonix virtual machines.

= Supported Platforms =
{{Supported_Platforms}}

= System Requirements =
== Minimum ==
* 1 GB free RAM (With Whonix-Gateway lowered to 196 MB)
* 10 GB free hard drive space.

== Recommended ==
* Additional hard drive space when installing applications into Workstation.
* A CPU with AMD-V<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization#AMD_virtualization_.28AMD-V.29</ref> or Intel VT-x<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization#Intel_virtualization_.28VT-x.29</ref>

== For Best Performance ==
* An SSD.
* Additional RAM to dedicate to Workstation when multitasking.

== Notes ==
* Whonix-Workstation can run with 196 when not using a desktop environment.
* For low memory and console-only configurations, see [[Desktop#RAM_Adjusted_Desktop_Starter]].
* If you do not have AMD-V or Intel VT-x and you encounter PAE or "{{Code2|VERR_SSM_FIELD_NOT_CONSECUTIVE}}" error, please read [[Starting Whonix#PAE crash|PAE Crash]] for a workaround.
* Linux users with low RAM might save some RAM on the host if used a lighter desktop environment than KDE, Gnome etc. such as xfce or lxde.
