= Supported Host Operating Systems =
Any operating system that can run a supported virtualizer can run {{project_name}}, including Windows, macOS, BSD, and Linux. Most users get started by installing [[VirtualBox]] on their current operating system and importing the {{project_name}} images. Advanced users may wish to boot a host operating system (usually a Unix variant) dedicated solely to running the {{project_name}} virtual machines. 

For the best possible security, users can choose to run {{project_name}} virtual machines on the Qubes platform ({{q_project_name}}). Qubes is a Xen-based hypervisor (virtualizer) that runs on the bare metal of the hardware instead of within a host operating system. <ref>This is more secure because an attacker must subvert the hypervisor, which is far more difficult than exploiting a host operating system.</ref>

| text    = <blockquote>The system requirements on this page are necessary, but not sufficient, for Qubes compatibility at a minimal or recommended level. In other words, just because a computer satisfies these requirements doesn't mean that Qubes will successfully install and run on it. We strongly recommend consulting the [https://www.qubes-os.org/hcl/ Hardware Compatibility List] to verify that Qubes can install and run on your specific model in the ways you need it to. ... <br /> <br />Qubes '''can''' be installed on systems which do not meet the recommended requirements. Such systems will still offer significant security improvements over traditional operating systems, since things like GUI isolation and kernel protection do not require special hardware.<ref>https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/system-requirements/</ref></blockquote>

== Minimum (Qubes 4.X) ==
* 4 GB RAM.
* 32 GB disk space.
* A 64-bit Intel or AMD processor - <code>x86_64</code> aka <code>x64</code> aka <code>AMD64</code>. <ref> Qubes system requirements are directly sourced from https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/system-requirements/</ref>
** Intel VT-x with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Level_Address_Translation#Extended_Page_Tables EPT] or AMD-V with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Level_Address_Translation#Rapid_Virtualization_Indexing RVI]. <ref>This is required for running [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/hvm/ HVM domains], such as Windows-based AppVMs.</ref>
** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization#Intel-VT-d Intel VT-d] or [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization#I.2FO_MMU_virtualization_.28AMD-Vi_and_Intel_VT-d.29 AMD-Vi] (aka AMD IOMMU) - required for effective isolation of network VMs and [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/assigning-devices/ PCI passthrough].

== Recommended ==
* A fast SSD - strongly recommended.
* Intel IGP - strongly preferred.
** Nvidia GPUs may require significant troubleshooting.
** ATI GPUs have not been formally tested, but see the [https://www.qubes-os.org/hcl/ Hardware Compatibility List].
* TPM with proper BIOS support - required for [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/anti-evil-maid/ Anti Evil Maid].
* 16 GB+ RAM minimum. 32 GB+ for power users. <ref>Users report problems in creating DisposableVMs and running multiple VMs in parallel with only 4 GB RAM. 8 GB RAM is nearly exhausted with {{q_project_name}} VMs running in parallel with the <code>sys-net</code>, <code>sys-firewall</code> and <code>sys-usb</code> AppVMs.</ref>
* A non-USB keyboard or multiple USB controllers to enable creation of a [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/usb/ USB VM]. <ref>To prevent malicious compromise of dom0 via USB mice, keyboards or other USB devices.</ref>
* Interrupt remapping - this helps resist potential (hypothetical) attacks coming from compromised driver domains like <code>sys-net</code> or <code>sys-usb</code>. <ref>https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/3208</ref>

== Hardware Purchases ==

Before purchasing any hardware specifically for Qubes, consider [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/certified-laptops/ Qubes Certified Hardware], [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/hardware-testing/ Qubes Hardware Testing] or at least the [https://www.qubes-os.org/hcl/ hardware compatibility list (HCL)] for suitable models. Without referring to any of these, there is a chance that a computer without the above specifications will be incompatible with Qubes.

Also note the fairly priced [https://www.qubes-os.org/news/2019/07/18/insurgo-privacybeast-qubes-certification/ Insurgo PrivacyBeast X230] is the first custom, refurbished laptop to exceed all Qubes hardware certification requirements. <ref>
This includes:
* Binary-blob-free Coreboot initialization, including native graphic initialization.
* Heads provides an Anti-evil Maid (AEM) firmware solution and protects against malicious interdiction.
* Intel ME is neutered and unnecessary modules involved in main CPU initialization have been deleted.
* Ships with Qubes OS pre-installed (with full-disk encryption), with the final disk encryption key being regenerated when first powered on by the buyer.
