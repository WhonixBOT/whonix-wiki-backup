= Supported Host Operating Systems =
Any operating system that can run VirtualBox can run Whonix, including Windows, Mac, BSD, and Linux. Most users get started by installing VirtualBox on their current operating system and importing the Whonix images.

Advanced users may wish to boot a host operating system (usually a Unix variant) dedicated solely to running the Whonix virtual machines.

= System Requirements =
== Minimum ==
* 1 GB free RAM (With Whonix-Gateway lowered to 128 MB)
* 10 GB free hard drive space.

== Recommended ==
* Additional hard drive space when installing applications into Workstation.
* A CPU with AMD-V<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization#AMD_virtualization_.28AMD-V.29</ref> or Intel VT-x<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization#Intel_virtualization_.28VT-x.29</ref>

== For Best Performance ==
* An SSD.
* Additional RAM to dedicate to Workstation when multitasking.

== Notes ==
* Whonix-workstation can run with 128 MB when not using a desktop environment.
* For low memory and console-only configurations, see [[Desktop#RAM_Adjusted_Desktop_Starter]].
* If you do not have AMD-V or Intel VT-x and you encounter PAE or "{{Code2|VERR_SSM_FIELD_NOT_CONSECUTIVE}}" error, please read [[Starting Whonix#PAE crash|PAE Crash]] for a workaround.
