Whonix-Workstation has the transparent proxying feature enabled by default. (You could [[Stream_Isolation#Better_Protection|disable it]] if you wanted to.)

Whonix-Gateway has by default no transparent proxying feature. This article explains how you could enable it. There are no known use cases besides [[Dev/Leak Tests|leak testing]].

On Whonix-Gateway.

For explanation, open {{Code|/etc/whonix_firewall.d/30_user}} and read what the settings {{Code|GATEWAY_TRANSPARENT_TCP}} and {{Code|GATEWAY_TRANSPARENT_DNS}} are about.

{{CodeSelect|code=
kwrite /etc/whonix_firewall.d/30_user
}}

Create a file {{Code|/etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_user.conf}}.

{{CodeSelect|code=
kdesudo kwrite /etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_user.conf
}}

Add the following content.

{{CodeSelect|code=
GATEWAY_TRANSPARENT_TCP=1
GATEWAY_TRANSPARENT_DNS=1
}}

Save.

{{Reload Firewall}}

{{Open /etc/tor/torrc}}

Add the following content.

{{CodeSelect|code=
TransPort 127.0.0.1:9041
DnsPort 127.0.0.1:54
}}

Save.

{{Reload Tor}}

Test if you wish.

{{CodeSelect|code=
curl.anondist-orig --tlsv1 --proto =https -H 'Host: check.torproject.org' -k https://38.229.72.22 | grep IP
}}
