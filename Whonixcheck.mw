= Introduction =
{{Code2|whonixcheck}} is a bash script which checks numerous, important system variables. whonixcheck can be run in a CLI environment (such as in terminal emulator xfce4-terminal) or via the GUI option, which has an in-built progress meter and summary notification popup of the results. The script is stored in the {{Code|/usr/bin/whonixcheck}} and {{Code|/usr/lib/whonix/whonixcheck/}} directories. {{project_name}} is functional without the whonixcheck script since it only checks the system status; it is not responsible for core settings. Nothing is compiled, and the script can be easily inspected in the source code.

The whonixcheck script was inspired by https://check.torproject.org. In the past this was an important check when people were still recommended to use proxy settings to torify web browsers. Tor Browser is now securely pre-configured upon release, which means manual torification of web browsers is now recommended against. As an additional protection the default Tor Browser visits <code>check.torproject.org</code> to confirm everything is working as expected. <ref>Tor Browser in {{project_name}} is configured to load a local {{project_name}} resource after launch -- the familiar landing page.</ref> This site also checks whether Tor Browser is up-to-date by having Tor Button perform a local check after downloading version information.

<code>check.torproject.org</code> is useful for a browser check, but {{project_name}} is a complete operating system. This means certain checks must be performed before the browser starts, otherwise a user's anonymity or security might be compromised. whonicheck's design allows the entire {{project_name}} community to stay informed about important updates or advice, and this is particularly important for users who might not start the browser or visit the {{project_name}} website regularly. For these reasons, whonixcheck is automatically started after boot/login if it has not been completed within the last 24 hours. This behavior holds true even if the system is not restarted, thereby keeping any long-running systems (like [[Onion_Services|Onion Services]]) safely informed.

If it is necessary to hide Tor and {{project_name}} use from an ISP, see [[Hide_Tor_and_{{project_name_short}}_from_your_ISP|here]]. While only a small minority of users configure their system to hide Tor, it is still desirable to hide any obvious {{project_name}} signature. {{project_name}} users are better off if adversaries cannot distinguish them from vanilla Tor Browser users, as the {{project_name}} user pool is far smaller. 

When whonixcheck auto-starts, it first waits for a randomized period of time ranging between 60 and 500 seconds. This obfuscation feature is intended to further stymie traffic analysis, while Tor is still responsible for basic defenses against traffic volume and pattern signatures. Without waiting for a randomized period traffic flows would be more distinguishable, since a spike in whonixcheck traffic would always occur immediately after bootstrapping.

{{Running_Whonixcheck}}

== Tor Bootstrap ==
Tor bootstrap refers to the process of attempting to connect to the Tor network (successfully or unsuccessfully). Familiar output related to this process includes: "Tor connecting xx percent...", "Tor not connected", "Tor connected" and so on. Bootstrapping does not refer to related concepts, such as whether connections are "secure", "not secure", "anonymous" or "not anonymous".

= System Checks =

In all the checks below, whonixcheck warnings appear if a problem is detected. Conversely, whonixcheck output is otherwise quiet unless using the <code>--verbose</code> option. Any operating system updates, downloads or other network activity are [[Stream_Isolation|stream-isolated]] by default.

Advice is provided on what to do in such circumstances.</ref> This prevents connection failures during concurrent upgrades of the Tor or [[Dev/CPFP|Control Port Filter Proxy]] packages.
|-

! scope="row"| Tor
| Check: 
* If Tor has been enabled by inspecting if {{Code|DisableNetwork 1}} has been commented out from {{Code|/usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf}} either manually or via whonixsetup.
* If the Tor process (pid) is running on {{gateway_product_name}} (<code>sys-whonix</code>).
* The validity of Tor configuration files in {{gateway_product_name}} (<code>sys-whonix</code>) by using {{Code|sudo tor --verify-config}}.
Notify about the Tor connection / IP address. <ref>Some users may wonder why it is necessary to check the IP address if the {{project_name}} design ensures that the real IP cannot be leaked. Sometimes <code>check.torproject.org</code> reports false positives and fails to detect Tor exit nodes, so it is better to provide information about that possibility. This also reduces support requests and bad press. Users are welcome to investigate a Tor exit node that could not be detected, but it can be stated with high confidence that the IP address will be associated with a known Tor exit node.</ref> <ref>Another reason to perform this check is because some users set up dangerous and/or unsupported configurations, such as:
* Changing the {{workstation_product_name}} (<code>anon-whonix</code>) network interface from {{Code|internal}} network {{Code|"{{project_name_short}}"}} to {{Code|bridged}} or {{Code|NAT}}.
* Using virtualizers which are entirely unsupported and untested by {{project_name}} developers.
* Installing arbitrary packages on {{workstation_product_name}} (<code>{{whonix-ws}}</code>). This could theoretically create leak vectors, and whonixcheck is the last layer of defense against such leaks.</ref>

= Version Numbers =
{{Anchor|Whonix Build Version}}
== {{project_name}} Build Version ==

The version number of the {{project_name}} build never changes. This is acceptable because at build time <ref>The time at which the image was created.</ref> the current {{project_name}} version number is added to the image itself. <ref>
The [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/anon-shared-build-log-build-version anon-shared-build-log-build-version] package, [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/anon-shared-build-log-build-version/blob/master/usr/lib/anon-dist/chroot-scripts-post.d/70_log_build_version 70_log_build_version] [[Dev/Source_Code_Intro#Chroot_Scripts|chroot script]] in essence runs:
<pre>
echo "$anon_dist_build_version" > "/var/lib/anon-dist/build_version"
</pre>
</ref> 
This information is made available so whonixcheck can determine which build script version was used to create that particular image. 

This version number should remain static and be unaffected by updating or other issues, since it only applies to specific (usually older) versions of the build script. This is useful for diagnostic purposes and means specific build versions can be deprecated if they are too difficult or expensive to upgrade. In this case,  whonixcheck's [[#System_Checks|{{project_name}} News]] function would inform users about the change.

== Check Version ==

To check the current {{project_name}} version, run the following command.

{{CodeSelect|code=
whonixcheck --verbose --function show_versions
}}

Should show something like the following.

<blockquote>

= Security =
When using <code>whonixcheck</code> with parameter <code>--leak-tests</code> curl will verify the SSL certificate for downloads from <code>check.torproject.org</code> -- <code>SocksPort</code> Test, <code>TransPort</code> Test, -- and abort if the certificate is not valid. The [https://packages.debian.org/source/stable/ca-certificates ca-certificates Debian package] is installed on {{project_name}}. 

When manually running this test, attack surface for this script includes at least curl, apt-get, gpg, grep, sed, bash, uwt, torsocks, zenity, and pgrep. {{project_name}} developers have assessed that the benefits of this check outweigh the potential risks.

== SSL Certificate Pinning ==

=== Introduction ===
By default, {{project_name}} has not yet implemented direct SSL certificate pinning for <code>check.torproject.org</code> using curl. <ref>
https://phabricator.whonix.org/T80
</ref> The intent is to eventually provide users with an optional torproject.org certificate pinning option for the SocksPort Test, TransPort Test and Tor Browser Update Check. To manually configure this setting, see below.

=== How-to ===
These instructions have moved to: [[Next#whonixcheck_SSL_Certificate_Pinning|whonixcheck SSL Certificate Pinning]].

=== Defaults Discussion ===
Interested readers can learn more about why this feature is not enabled by default [[Dev/SSL Certificate Pinning#Defaults Discussion|here]].

= Source Code Introduction =

== whonixcheck Information Sources ==

# Followed by all files in [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/whonixcheck/tree/master/usr/lib/whonixcheck /usr/lib/whonixcheck/] in lexical order.

== whonixcheck Operation ==

After gathering the above information, whonixcheck runs functions in {{Code2|whonixcheck_main}} while passing command line arguments.

Function {{Code2|whonixcheck_main}} then calls:

# Function [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/whonixcheck/blob/master/usr/lib/whonixcheck/parse_cmd {{Code2|parse_cmd_options}}] while passing command line arguments.
# Function [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/whonixcheck/blob/master/usr/lib/whonixcheck/preparation#L82 {{Code2|preparation}}].
# Then uses function [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/whonixcheck/blob/master/usr/lib/whonixcheck/preparation#L17 {{Code2|whonixcheck_run_function}}] to run all other functions. <ref>The order differs for {{gateway_product_name}} (<code>sys-whonix</code>) and {{workstation_product_name}} (<code>anon-whonix</code>). For detailed information concerning differences, see {{Code2|/usr/bin/whonixcheck}}. The purpose of function {{Code2|whonixcheck_run_function}} is to allow users to add function names to configuration variable {{Code2|whonixcheck_skip_functions}}, which permits the skipping of certain functions. Also see: [[{{project name short}}check_Hardening|whonixcheck Hardening]].</ref>

== Additional Functions ==

The {{Code2|/usr/lib/whonixcheck/}} folder is not a real .d style plugin drop-in folder. The shell function for separate [{{project_name}}, unit] checks can be placed in separate files for better readability. The provided functions are then supposed to be run from {{Code2|/usr/bin/whonixcheck}} function {{Code2|whonixcheck_main}}.

As a simple example, inspect the file [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/whonixcheck/blob/master/usr/lib/whonixcheck/check_entropy {{Code2|/usr/lib/whonixcheck/check_entropy}}] which contains function {{Code2|check_entropy}}. Users can gather as much information as they like for analysis via this function.

<pre>
entropy_file="/proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail"
entropy_size="$(cat "$entropy_file")"
if [ "${entropy_size}" -lt "112" ]; then
</pre>

Now it is possible to use, copy and paste, or create a common boilerplate for making discoveries visible.
<pre>
local MSG="<p>Entropy Available Check Result: low. <code>$entropy_file</code>: <code>$entropy_size</code> Please report this issue!</p>"
$output ${output_opts[@]} --messagex --typex "warning" --message "$MSG"
$output ${output_opts[@]} --messagecli --typecli "warning" --message "$MSG"
</pre>

To limit the notifications to those running whonixcheck with the <code>--verbose</code> option, add.

<pre>
 if [ "$verbose" = "1" ]; then
</pre>

Other useful variables include:
<div style="column-count:2;-moz-column-count:2;-webkit-column-count:2">
* $TEMP_DIR
* $VM "{{gateway_product_name_short}}" or "{{workstation_product_name}}"
* $vm_lower_case_short "gateway" or "workstation"
* $GATEWAY_IP
* $whonix_codename /etc/apt/sources.list.d/whonix.list codename
* $whonix_codename_uppercase
* $DAEMON = 1 run in daemon mode
* $AUTOSTARTED = 1 run after boot
* $manualrun = 1 manually run
* $ARCH "$(uname --machine)"
* $whonix_build_version
* $whonix_deb_package_version

= Development =
== Use Cases ==

whonixcheck has specific use cases when it should be run either manually or automatically.

=== Automated Tests ===

Run after automatic boot by an automated test suite.

=== Auto-start Following Boot ===

# To provide connectivity progress information (Tor bootstrap check), with the familiar "in progress...", "done" (or failed) messages.
# As a general sanity check, for instance: the gateway is a ProxyVM and not an AppVM, IP forwarding is disabled, the clock is sane, and much more.

=== Manual User Start ===

# Connection functionality test.
# Connection leak test.
# General sanity check.
# General system security and anonymity check.
# As an information gathering tool, for example reporting the {{project_name}} Debian package and build version (build version requires the <code>--verbose</code> option).
# VPN / tunnel functionality test.
# To educate users that stream isolation is broken when adding a VPN.

== Planned Features ==

When an error occurs, provide: <ref>Issues resolved in {{project_name}} 14 include:
* Non-zero exit codes when at least one warning or error was detected [for automated test suite]; and
* Check for failed systemd units (except perhaps apparmor) for automated test suite.</ref>
* A short error message.
* A separate help button which opens advice relating to the problem.
* A separate technical details drop-down button which contains debugging information.
