= Introduction =
{{Code2|whonixcheck}} is a bash script which checks numerous, important system variables. whonixcheck can be run in a CLI environment (Konsole / Terminal) or via the GUI option, which has an in-built progress meter and summary notification popup of the results. The script is stored in the {{Code|/usr/bin/whonixcheck}} and {{Code|/usr/lib/whonix/whonixcheck/}} directories. Whonix is functional without the whonixcheck script since it only checks the system status; it is not responsible for core settings. Nothing is compiled, and the script can be easily inspected in the source code.

The whonixcheck script was inspired by https://check.torproject.org. In the past this was an important check when people were still recommended to use proxy settings to torify web browsers. Tor Browser is now securely pre-configured upon release, which means manual torification of web browsers is now recommended against. As an additional protection the default Tor Browser visits check.tpo to confirm everything is working as expected. <ref>Tor Browser in Whonix is configured to load a local Whonix resource after launch -- the familiar landing page.</ref> This site also checks whether Tor Browser is up-to-date by having Tor Button perform a local check after downloading version information.

check.tpo is useful for a browser check, but Whonix is a complete operating system. This means certain checks must be performed before the browser starts, otherwise a user's anonymity or security might be compromised. whonicheck's design allows the entire Whonix community to stay informed about important updates or advice, and this is particularly important for users who might not start the browser or visit the Whonix website regularly. For these reasons, whonixcheck is automatically started after boot/login if it has not been completed within the last 24 hours. This behavior holds true even if the system is not restarted, thereby keeping any long-running systems (like [[Onion_Services|Onion Services]]) safely informed.

If it is necessary to hide Tor and Whonix use from an ISP; see [[Hide_Tor_and_Whonix_from_your_ISP|here]]. While only a small minority of users configure their system to hide Tor, it is still desirable to hide any obvious Whonix signature. Whonix users are better off if adversaries cannot distinguish them from vanilla Tor Browser users, as the Whonix user pool is far smaller. 

When whonixcheck auto-starts, it first waits for a randomized period of time ranging between 60 and 500 seconds. This obfuscation feature is intended to further stymie traffic analysis, while Tor is still responsible for basic defenses against traffic volume and pattern signatures. Without waiting for a randomized period traffic flows would be more distinguishable, since a spike in whonixcheck traffic would always occur immediately after bootstrapping.

= System Checks =

In all the checks below, whonixcheck warnings appear if a problem is detected. Conversely, whonixcheck output is otherwise quiet unless using the <code>--verbose</code> option. Any operating system updates, downloads or other network activity are [[Stream_Isolation|stream-isolated]] by default.

'''Clock Source'''

* Checks if the clock source is KVMClock and warns if that is the case. <ref>This is only expected to affect those following the [[KVM]] instructions.</ref>

'''Control Port Filter Proxy'''

* Checks if [[Dev/CPFP|Control Port Filter Proxy]] is running.

'''Entropy Test'''

* An entropy availability check confirms {{Code|/proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail}} contains no less than 112 bytes.

'''Hostname'''

* Checks if:
** {{Code|hostname --fqdn}} outputs {{Code|host.localdomain}}.
** {{Code|hostname }} outputs {{Code|host}}.
** {{Code|hostname --ip-address }} outputs {{Code|127.0.0.1}}.
** {{Code|hostname --domain }} outputs {{Code|localdomain}}.
* Informs if [[Whonix-APT-Repository]] is enabled, and if so, which repository has been selected.

'''IP Address Routing'''

* Checks if IP forwarding is disabled on Whonix-Gateway (<code>sys-whonix</code>).

'''Log Inspection'''

* When using the <code>--verbose</code> option, checks if {{Code|~/.whonix/msgdispatcher-error.log}} or {{Code|~/.whonix/whonix_torbrowser_updater_error.log}} exist and reports this if confirmed.

'''Meta-package Check'''

* Checks if the relevant meta-packages <ref>These capture packages which depend on all other recommended / default-installed packages.</ref> are installed on Whonix-Gateway (<code>sys-whonix</code>) or Whonix-Workstation (<code>anon-whonix</code>). Also see: [[Whonix_Debian_Packages|Whonix Debian Packages]].

'''Network Connection'''

* Checks whonixsetup has properly configured networking.

'''Operating System Updates'''

* ''apt-get update'' is run through a separate apt-get SocksPort for stream isolation. A notification is provided whether the system is up-to-date or requires updating.

'''Package Manager'''

* Checks if a package manager is currently running and waits until the process is finished. <ref>Otherwise, eventually the system is locked or the package manager is left in a broken state. Advice is provided on what to do in such circumstances.</ref> This prevents connection failures during concurrent upgrades of the Tor or [[Dev/CPFP|Control Port Filter Proxy]] packages.

'''Tor'''

* Checks if Tor has been enabled by inspecting if {{Code|DisableNetwork 1}} has been commented out from {{Code|/usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf}} either manually or via whonixsetup.
* Checks if the Tor process (pid) is running on Whonix-Gateway (<code>sys-whonix</code>).
* Checks the validity of Tor configuration files in Whonix-Gateway (<code>sys-whonix</code>) by using {{Code|sudo tor --verify-config}}.
* Notifies about the Tor connection / IP address. <ref>Some users may wonder why it is necessary to check the IP address if the Whonix design ensures that the real IP cannot be leaked. Sometimes check.tpo reports false positives and fails to detect Tor exit nodes, so it is better to provide information about that possibility. This also reduces support requests and bad press. Users are welcome to investigate a Tor exit node that could not be detected, but it can be stated with high confidence that the IP address will be associated with a known Tor exit node.</ref> <ref>Another reason to perform this check is to some users set up dangerous and/or unsupported configurations, such as:
* Changing the Whonix-Workstation (<code>anon-whonix</code>) network interface from {{Code|internal}} network {{Code|"Whonix"}} to {{Code|bridged}} or {{Code|NAT}}.
* Using virtualizers which are entirely unsupported and untested by Whonix developers.
* Install arbitrary packages on Whonix-Workstation (<code>anon-whonix</code>). This could theoretically create leak vectors, and whonixcheck is the last layer of defense against such leaks.</ref>

'''Tor Bootstrap and Browser Version'''

* Tor Bootstrap Status:
** (1) Downloads https://check.torproject.org with curl through an extra SocksPort.
** (2) Downloads https://check.torproject.org with curl through TransPort.
* On Whonix-Workstation (<code>anon-whonix</code>), a [[Stream Isolation]] test checks the IP addresses from (1) and (2) differ.
* Tor Browser version:
** Downloads https://check.torproject.org/RecommendedTBBVersions with curl through an extra SocksPort.

'''Virtualization Platform'''

* Checks Whonix is being run on one of the supported virtualizer platforms, including bare metal ([[Physical Isolation]]), [[VirtualBox]], [[KVM]] or [[Qubes]].

'''Whonix Version and News'''

* [[Download#Whonix_Version_Check_and_Whonix_News|Downloads the Whonix version and Whonix news]]. <ref>One future development goal is to provide protection against a [[Dev/ptt|Permanent Takedown Attack]].</ref> <ref>Also see [[Trust]].</ref>
** Downloads Whonix News Files with curl through an extra Whonix news SocksPort.
* This check is designed to be functional:
** If the Whonix repository is down or has changed.
** For users who have disabled [[Whonix-APT-Repository]] permanently or only enable it intermittently.
* News features:
** The [[Dev/News|Whonix News Format]] only reports the most important news for those not following Whonix developments. <ref>For example, if a theoretical IP address leak was discovered in Whonix, or exit nodes were discovered to be actively exploiting apt-get traffic, then this avenue would briefly inform users about the danger.</ref>
** The Whonix version and news file is cryptographically signed by lead Whonix developer Patrick Schleizer.
** Patrick's GPG key is copied to {{Code|whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/keys/whonix-keys.d/}} at build time.
** A warning appears if the file can not be GPG-verified with Patrick's OpenPGP key. In that instance the version information and news is ignored.
** Messages signed more than one month in the past are rejected and the user is informed the message is no longer valid.

= Version Numbers =
== Whonix Build Version ==
The version number of the build. It never changes. And that is fine. At build time <ref>
The time at which the image was created.
</ref> the current Whonix version number is being added to the image itself. <ref>
The [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-shared-build-log-build-version anon-shared-build-log-build-version] package, [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-shared-build-log-build-version/blob/master/usr/lib/anon-dist/chroot-scripts-post.d/70_log_build_version 70_log_build_version] [[Dev/Source_Code_Intro#Chroot_Scripts|chroot script]] does in essence.
<pre>
echo "$anon_dist_build_version" > "/var/lib/anon-dist/build_version"
</pre>
</ref> It is there so whonixcheck can find out which version of the build script has created that version. This version number is supposed to never change. This is because sometimes updating or other issues do only apply to version created by specific, mostly older versions of the build script. This helps with diagnostic purposes therefore, should we ever need to deprecate a specific build version (because it would be too difficult/expensive to upgrade), then whonixcheck's [[#Whonix News]] could inform about this.

= Security =
The ''ca-certificates'' Debian package is installed on Whonix. Curl will verify the SSL certificate for downloads from check.tpo (SocksPort Test, TransPort Test, Tor Browser version check) and aborts if the certificate is not valid.

Attack surface for this script includes at least curl, apt-get, gpg, grep, sed, bash, uwt, torsocks, zenity, pgrep. Patrick believes, that benefits outweigh the risks not running those checks. The user is free to ''sudo chmod -x /usr/bin/whonixcheck'' and Patrick remains as always open for reviews and suggestions.

== SSL Certificate Pinning ==
=== Introduction ===
<s>In whonixcheck 1.1-1 / Whonix 10 and above there will be an optional torproject.org certificate pinning option for SocksPort Test, TransPort Test and Tor Browser Update Check. If you want to use this, see below.</s>

https://phabricator.whonix.org/T80

=== How ===
Moved to: [[Next#whonixcheck_SSL_Certificate_Pinning]].

=== Defaults Discussion ===
For reasons for (not) enabling this feature by default, see [[Dev/SSL Certificate Pinning#Defaults Discussion]].

= Source Code Introduction =

* followed by all files in [https://github.com/Whonix/whonixcheck/tree/master/usr/lib/whonixcheck /usr/lib/whonixcheck/] in lexical order

Then runs functions {{Code2|whonixcheck_main}} while passing command line arguments.

Function {{Code2|whonixcheck_main}} then calls:

* function [https://github.com/Whonix/whonixcheck/blob/master/usr/lib/whonixcheck/parse_cmd {{Code2|parse_cmd_options}}] while passing command line arguments
* function [https://github.com/Whonix/whonixcheck/blob/master/usr/lib/whonixcheck/preparation#L82 {{Code2|preparation}}]
* then uses function [https://github.com/Whonix/whonixcheck/blob/master/usr/lib/whonixcheck/preparation#L17 {{Code2|whonixcheck_run_function}}] to run all other functions. The order differs for Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation. To find out how exactly and in which order, please have a look at {{Code2|/usr/bin/whonixcheck}}. The purpose of function {{Code2|whonixcheck_run_function}} is to allow users adding function names to configuration variable {{Code2|whonixcheck_skip_functions}} which allows to skip certain functions. (See also [[Advanced_Security_Guide#whonixcheck_Hardening|whonixcheck Hardening]].)

The {{Code2|/usr/lib/whonixcheck/}} folder is not a real .d style plugin drop-in folder. Shell function for separate [Whonix, unit] checks can be be put into separate files for better readability. The provided functions are then supposed to be run from {{Code2|/usr/bin/whonixcheck}} function {{Code2|whonixcheck_main}}.

For a simple example have a look at file [https://github.com/Whonix/whonixcheck/blob/master/usr/lib/whonixcheck/check_entropy {{Code2|/usr/lib/whonixcheck/check_entropy}}] which contains function {{Code2|check_entropy}}. You can just do any information gathering and analysis as you want. In essence, in the function {{Code2|check_entropy}} example, that is.

<pre>
entropy_file="/proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail"
entropy_size="$(cat "$entropy_file")"
if [ "${entropy_size}" -lt "112" ]; then
</pre>

Then you can use, copy and paste, common boilerplate for making what you found out visible.
<pre>
local MSG="<p>Entropy Available Check Result: low. <code>$entropy_file</code>: <code>$entropy_size</code> Please report this issue!</p>"
$output ${output_opts[@]} --messagex --typex "warning" --message "$MSG"
$output ${output_opts[@]} --messagecli --typecli "warning" --message "$MSG"
</pre>

Or if you wanted to only output it, if the user has run whonixcheck with --verbose, then you could use.

<pre>
 if [ "$verbose" = "1" ]; then
</pre>

Other useful variables are available.

* $TEMP_DIR
* $VM "Whonix-Gateway" or "Whonix-Workstation"
* $vm_lower_case_short "gateway" or "workstation"
* $GATEWAY_IP
* $whonix_codename /etc/apt/sources.list.d/whonix.list codename
* $whonix_codename_uppercase
* $DAEMON = 1 run in daemon mode
* $AUTOSTARTED = 1 run after boot
* $manualrun = 1 manually run
* $ARCH "$(uname --machine)"
* $whonix_build_version
* $whonix_deb_package_version

For more examples, please look what other functions in folder {{Code2|/usr/lib/whonixcheck/}} are doing.

* always skip disclaimer when running inside Qubes
* made whonixcheck more silent, suitable for Qubes AppVM design
<br />
1) If running in Qubes, when autostarted (after boot) -> silent=3<br />
2) If running in Qubes, when daemon (planed iteration during run) -> silent=3<br />
3) Silent only applies to autostart and daemon mode. When manually run, show all messages. Same as Whonix 11.<br />
4) overview of various silent levels
<br />
* silent lower/equal 0: show SocksPort and TransPort "Test Result: Connected to Tor. IP" messages

* silent greater/equal 1: no "whonixcheck was recently run, no need to run it again, you could still manually start it" message.

* silent lower/equal 2: do test SocksPort and TransPort but only report errors (no connectivity, Tor not detected and false positives)

* silent greater/equal 2: no "Tor Bootstrap Result: Connected to Tor." message unless bootstrapping took a while and a progress bar was shown
* silent greater/equal 2: do test stream isolation, but only report errors
* silent greater/equal 2: no Whonix News result if there are no news and debian and build version up to date
* silent greater/equal 2: no "No updates found via apt-get" message
    
* silent greater/equal 3: no Tor SocksPort / TransPort test at all
* silent greater/equal 3: no stream isolation test at all
* silent greater/equal 3: no Whonix News check at all
* silent greater/equal 3: no apt-get update check at all
* silent greater/equal 3: skip to inform if Whonix repository is enabled
* silent greater/equal 3: no progress bar for the usual tests. Except a progress bar if Tor is not bootstrapped yet.
* silent greater/equal 3: skip test if a package manager is already running.

* silent greater/equal 4: skip test whether Whonix repository enabled/disabled test at all. In other words, do not report disabled Whonix repository.

= Development =
== Use Cases ==
* automated test: run after automatic boot by an automated test suite
* automatic run after boot: as connectivity progress information (Tor bootstrap check) (in progress... done [or failed])
* automatic run after boot: as a general sanity check [run gateway in ProxyVM, not AppVM, IP forwarding disabled, clock sanity, and much more]

* manual by the user: as connection functionality test
* manual by the user: as connection leak test
* manual by the user: as a general sanity check
* manual by the user: as a general system security and anonymity check
* manual by the user: as an information gather tool, shows Whonix Debian Package Version (and when using with --verbose it shows Whonix build version)
* manual by the user: as a VPN / tunnel functionality test

* to educate users: when they add a VPN, it breaks stream isolation

== TODO ==
* <s>non-zero exit codes when at least one warning or error was detected [for automated test suite]</s> (Done in Whonix 14)
* <s>check for failed systemd units [except perhaps apparmor] [for automated test suite]</s> (Done in Whonix 14)
* on error -> short error message, separate help button opens help, separate technical details drop down button shows debugging information
