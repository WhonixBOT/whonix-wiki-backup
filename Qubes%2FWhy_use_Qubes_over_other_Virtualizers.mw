|description=Qubes advantages over VirtualBox and KVM
}}

=== Why use Qubes over other Virtualizers? ===
* Security
** Network stack, WiFi drivers are running in a dedicated network VM, which reduces attack surface.
** Qubes actively discourages using the host (dom0) for any other purposes than running VMs.
** No networking on the host (dom0). Even the download part of fetching host (dom0) upgrades is done in a dedicated UpdateVM (currently by default NetVM), before those are verified and installed on dom0.
** [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/DisposableVms/ DisposableVMs] <ref>There are no disposable Whonix VMs yet, but Qubes encourages using regular / DisposableVMs.</ref>
** {{software compartmentalization vs. physical separation}}
** Multiple Whonix-Workstations AppVMs can easily use the same Whonix-Gateway ProxyVM without being able to contact each other. <ref>
This issue for non-Qubes-Whonix is documented on the [[Multiple Whonix-Workstations]] wiki page.

* Usability
** Usable, secure clipboard and files [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/CopyPaste/ copy and paste].
** Easier [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/BackupRestore/ backup / restore of VMs].
** Keyboard layout only needs to be configured once in dom0.
** No duplicate task bars.
** Default seamless mode for windows. (Similar to VirtualBox’s Seamless Mode or VMware’s Unity Mode. <ref>http://www.howtogeek.com/171145/use-virtualboxs-seamless-mode-or-vmwares-unity-mode-to-seamlessly-run-programs-from-a-virtual-machine/</ref>) Yet, distinction of which window comes from what VM is easily possible. <ref>https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/GettingStarted/</ref>
* Performance
** VMs start up much faster, because fewer services need to be started.
** AppVMs therefore also take much less RAM.
** AppVMs take much fewer disk space, because those can share the root image of the TemplateVM. (Read more: [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/TemplateImplementation/ TemplateImplementation])
=== [[Qubes|Qubes-Whonix]] advantages over [[Non-Qubes-Whonix]] ===
* Usability
** [[Non-Qubes-Whonix_Known_bugs|Non-Qubes-Whonix specific known issues]] do not apply.
** No confusing [[Non-Qubes-Whonix_Known_bugs#Network_Manager_Systray_Unmanaged_Devices|Network Manager Systray Unmanaged Devices]], since there is no duplicate taskbar.
** No confusion by the VM timezone set to UTC (for anonymity reasons) <ref>[[Post_Install_Advice#Network_Time_Syncing|]</ref>, since there is no duplicate taskbar. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T71</ref>
** Watching videos using VLC works out of the box. <ref>
