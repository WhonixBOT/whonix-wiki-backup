By default, all {{workstation_product_name}} traffic is forced through {{gateway_product_name}}. Alternatively, a chain of anonymizing gateways can be built, with sample tunnel configurations outlined below.

Before attempting complex tunnel configurations, the following basic knowledge is required:

* [[Tunnels/Introduction|Tunnels Introduction]]
* [[Stream Isolation]]

This [[Dev/Inspiration|Inspiration]] resource may also be useful.

= Possible Configurations =

== Pre-Tor-VPN ==

{{CodeSelect|code=
## chain:
{{workstation_product_name}} -> VPN-Gateway -> {{gateway_product_name}} -> clearnet
## connection scheme:
user -> VPN -> Tor -> Internet
}}

For instructions, see [[Tunnels/Connecting_to_a_VPN_before_Tor|here]]. To learn more details about this configuration, refer to this [[Tunnels/Introduction#Connecting_to_a_tunnel-link_.28proxy.2FVPN.2FSSH.29_before_Tor|entry]].

== Post-Tor-VPN ==

{{CodeSelect|code=
## chain:
{{workstation_product_name}} -> {{gateway_product_name}} -> VPN-Gateway -> clearnet
## connection scheme:
user -> Tor -> VPN -> Internet
}}

For instructions, see [[Tunnels/Connecting_to_Tor_before_a_VPN|here]]. To learn more details about this configuration, refer to this [[Tunnels/Introduction#Connecting_to_Tor_before_a_tunnel-link_.28proxy.2FVPN.2FSSH.29|entry]].

== Pre- and Post-Tor-VPN ==

{{CodeSelect|code=
## chain:
{{workstation_product_name}} -> VPN-Gateway -> {{gateway_product_name}} -> VPN-Gateway -> Internet
## connection scheme:
user -> VPN -> Tor -> VPN -> Internet
}}

{{project_name}} is not limited to VPN-Gateways; the VPN can be replaced with a Proxy-Gateway.

== Post-Tor-Proxy ==

{{CodeSelect|code=
## chain:
{{workstation_product_name}} -> Proxy-Gateway -> {{gateway_product_name}} -> clearnet
## connection scheme:
user -> Tor -> Proxy -> Internet
}}

For instructions, see [[Tunnels/Connecting_to_Tor_before_a_proxy|here]]. To learn more details about this configuration, refer to this [[Tunnels/Introduction#Connecting_to_Tor_before_a_tunnel-link_.28proxy.2FVPN.2FSSH.29|entry]].

== Other Connection Schemes ==

Virtually any combination is possible: a Post-Tor-Proxy; a Pre/Post-Tor-SSH; or the proxy being replaced with JonDo or perhaps I2P.

Always remember that the connection will be created in reverse order; see the example below. <ref>"Internet" below refers to the destination server, such as a website.</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
## chain:
{{workstation_product_name}} -> Proxy-Gateway -> {{gateway_product_name}} -> VPN-Gateway -> clearnet
## connection scheme:
user -> VPN -> Tor -> Proxy -> Internet
}}

Upon reflection, it becomes clear why the connection happens in reverse order:

* {{workstation_product_name}} has no option but to pass through the Proxy-Gateway. 
* The Proxy-Gateway has no option but to pass through {{gateway_product_name}}. 
* In this case, the last element in the chain is the VPN-Gateway, which must obviously connect via [[FAQ#What_is_Clearnet.3F|clearnet]]. 

In other terms: 

* The VPN-Gateway uses clearnet. 
* {{gateway_product_name}} uses the VPN-Gateway to connect.
* The Proxy-Gateway uses {{gateway_product_name}} to connect.
* {{workstation_product_name}} uses the Proxy-Gateway to connect. 

Since the Proxy-Gateway can only pass through {{gateway_product_name}} followed by the VPN-Gateway, it is clear why it will be the last hop in front of the destination server.

= Other Considerations =

Whether these combinations make sense in terms of security and anonymity is hotly debated and depends on your personal threat model, see [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN Tor plus VPN or Proxy]. Advanced tunneling configurations also require knowledge of how to properly edit ''/etc/network/interfaces'' on {{gateway_product_name}} and/or on {{workstation_product_name}}. In the case of [[{{non q project name short}}|{{non q project name}}]], this refers to the virtual internal network name in VirtualBox settings.

This process is generally difficult because there are no other anonymizing gateways (VPN / JonDo / I2P / Proxy / SSH / VPN) available for download in {{project_name}}, just the {{gateway_product_name}} which uses Tor to anonymize traffic. This means a search for instructions is often required and/or an anonymizing gateway must be built from scratch. <ref>Instructions for a pfSense based VPN-Gateway can be found with search engines, but it is untested for leaks.</ref>
