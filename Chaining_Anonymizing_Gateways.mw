By default, all Whonix-Workstation traffic is forced through Whonix-Gateway. Alternatively, a chain of anonymizing gateways can be built, with sample tunnel configurations outlined below.

= Possible Configurations =

== Post-Tor-VPN ==

<pre>
## chain:
Whonix-Workstation -> VPN-Gateway    -> Whonix-Gateway -> clearnet
## connection scheme:
user               -> Tor            -> VPN            -> Internet
</pre>

== Pre-Tor-VPN ==

<pre>
## chain:
Whonix-Workstation -> Whonix-Gateway -> VPN-Gateway    -> clearnet
## connection scheme:
user               -> VPN            -> Tor            -> Internet
</pre>

== Pre- and Post-Tor-VPN ==

<pre>
## chain:
Whonix-Workstation -> VPN-Gateway    -> Whonix-Gateway -> VPN-Gateway -> Internet
## connection scheme:
user               -> VPN            -> Tor            -> VPN         -> Internet
</pre>

Whonix is not limited to VPN-Gateways; the VPN can be replaced with a Proxy-Gateway.

== Post-Tor-Proxy ==

<pre>
## chain:
Whonix-Workstation -> Proxy-Gateway  -> Whonix-Gateway -> clearnet
## connection scheme:
user               -> Tor            -> Proxy          -> Internet
</pre>

== Other Connection Schemes ==

Virtually any combination is possible: a Post-Tor-Proxy; a Pre/Post-Tor-SSH; or the proxy being replaced with JonDo or perhaps I2P.

The user should always remember that the connection will be created in reverse order. This is best explained using an example. <ref>"Internet" below refers to the destination server (a website for example).</ref>

<pre>
## chain:
Whonix-Workstation -> Proxy-Gateway  -> Whonix-Gateway -> VPN-Gateway -> clearnet
## connection scheme:
user               -> VPN            -> Tor            -> Proxy       -> Internet
</pre>

Upon reflection, it becomes clear why the connection happens in reverse order:

* Whonix-Workstation has no way but to go through the Proxy-Gateway. 
* The Proxy-Gateway has no way but to go through Whonix-Gateway. 
* In this case, the last element in the chain is the VPN-Gateway, which must obviously connect through clearnet. 


Thus, the VPN-Gateway uses clearnet, the Whonix-Gateway uses the VPN-Gateway to connect, the Proxy-Gateway uses Whonix-Gateway to connect, and Whonix-Workstation uses the Proxy-Gateway to connect. Since the Proxy-Gateway has option but to go through Whonix-Gateway followed by VPN-Gateway, it is clear why it will be the last hop in front of the destination server.

= Other Considerations =

Whether these combinations make sense in terms of security and anonymity is hotly debated and depends on the user's personal threat model, see [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN Tor plus VPN or Proxy].

Before attempting complex tunnel configurations, the following basic knowledge is required:

* [[Tunnels/Introduction]]
* [[Stream Isolation]]


This resource may also be useful: [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Inspiration Inspiration]. 

Users must also have an understanding of, and be able to edit /etc/network/interfaces on Whonix-Gateway and/or on Whonix-Workstation. In the case of non-Qubes-Whonix, this refers to the virtual internal network name in VirtualBox settings.

This process is generally difficult because there are no other anonymizing gateways (VPN / JonDo / I2P / Proxy / SSH / VPN) available for download in Whonix, just the Whonix-Gateway which uses Tor to anonymize traffic. Users often have to look for instructions and/or build an anonymizing gateway themselves. <ref>There are some instructions for a pfSense based VPN-Gateway which can be found with search engines, but it is untested for leaks.</ref>
