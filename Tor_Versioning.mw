= Newer Tor Versions from the {{project_name}} Repository =

Newer Tor versions can be installed by [[{{project name short}}-APT-Repository#Change_{{project_name_short}}_APT_Repository|enabling the {{project_name}} stable-proposed-updates repository]] in {{gateway_product_name}} (<code>{{whonix-gw}}</code>) and then [[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates#Updates|upgrading]] the system as usual. This is only recommended for testers.

= Even Newer Tor Versions from The Tor Project Repository =

Note: This action risks breaking connectivity, for instance if the latest Tor version from deb.torproject.org has not been fully tested by {{project_name}} developers at a specific point in time. <ref>
This has happened in the past. For example, on one occasion Tor from deb.torproject.org came with AppArmor changes that were incompatible with [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/anon-gw-anonymizer-config anon-gw-anonymizer-config]'s [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/anon-gw-anonymizer-config/blob/master/etc/apparmor.d/local/system_tor.anondist /etc/apparmor.d/local/system_tor.anondist] which resulted in Tor's systemd unit failing.
</ref>

To proceed despite the risk, install the even newer Tor version by enabling the deb.torproject.org repository. The [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/anon-shared-build-apt-sources-tpo anon-shared-build-apt-sources-tpo] package must be installed. This enables The Tor Project's apt-get signing key and installs the apt source torproject.list. <ref>
Alternatively you can use [https://www.torproject.org/docs/debian The Tor Project's native instructions for Debian], but these manual steps are more difficult and involved. The verification of The Tor Project apt-get signing key is also harder. Since you already [[trust]] {{project_name}}, the logical choice is to trust another {{project_name}} package to install the right signing key.
</ref>

In {{gateway_product_name}} (<code>{{whonix-gw}}</code>), [[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates#Updates|update]] the package lists.

<pre>
sudo apt-get update
</pre>

Install anon-shared-build-apt-sources-tpo.

<pre>
sudo apt-get install anon-shared-build-apt-sources-tpo
</pre>

Refresh the package lists. <ref>
So the newly installed <i>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/torproject.list</i> takes effect.
</ref>

<pre>
sudo apt-get update
</pre>

Install the (potentially) newer version of the <code>tor</code> package, as well as the <code>deb.torproject.org-keyring</code> package which keeps the Tor Project repository apt key up-to-date. <ref>A later version of Tor will not always be installed. For example, at the time of writing the stretch repositories for both packages.debian.org and deb.torproject.org have identical Tor versions. As the Debian stable release ages, the likelihood of receiving a newer Tor version from deb.torproject.org increases.</ref>

<pre>
sudo apt-get install tor deb.torproject.org-keyring
</pre>

= Onionize Tor Project Updates =

Only complete this step if the above [[Tor_Versioning|Newer Tor versions from The Tor Project Repository]] are in use. The Tor Project deb apt signing key must be added first (see the prior link), or error messages will appear when completing these steps.

== {{non_q_project_name_short}} ==
{{Box|text=
The following commands are run in {{gateway_product_name}}.

To onionize Tor Project updates, first create a torproject.list file using an editor.

{{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/torproject.list
}}

Next, cut and paste the following text and comment out (#) the corresponding http repository.

{{CodeSelect|code=

| text       = In Qubes R4.0 and above, TemplateVMs are non-network connected by default. This means any attempt to download the apt key in <code>{{whonix-gw}}</code> will fail. <ref>https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/1854</ref>

=== Add the Tor Signing Key ===

As a workaround, the Tor apt singing key can be fetched from a (networked) <code>anon-whonix</code> AppVM, then copied over to <code>{{whonix-gw}}</code> in a text file.

'''1.''' Add the Tor Project deb apt signing key.

Run the following command in <code>anon-whonix</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver jirk5u4osbsr34t5.onion --recv-keys A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89
}}

'''2.''' Display the key's fingerprint.

Run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-key adv --fingerprint A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89
}}

'''3.''' Examine the key's fingerprint.

Compare the fingerprint displayed in the terminal with the one listed on this website https://www.torproject.org/docs/signing-keys.html ([http://expyuzz4wqqyqhjn.onion/docs/signing-keys.html v2 onion]).

'''4.''' Copy the Tor signing key to <code>{{whonix-gw}}</code>.

In <code>anon-whonix</code>, copy the Tor singing key to a new text file named <code>tor.key</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-key export A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89 > /tmp/tor.key
}}

In <code>anon-whonix</code>, copy the <code>tor.key</code> text file over to <code>{{whonix-gw}}</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
qvm-copy /tmp/tor.key {{whonix-gw}}
}}

If the following error appears, it can be safely ignored (hit "OK" when prompted). 
  <i>qfile-agent: Fatal error: stat {{whonix-gw}}-version (error type: No such file or directory)</i>

'''5.''' Add the Tor signing key to the list of trusted keys

In <code>{{whonix-gw}}</code>, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-key add ~/QubesIncoming/anon-whonix/tor.key
}}

=== Onionize the Sources File ===

To onionize Tor Project updates, first create a torproject.list file using an editor.

{{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/torproject.list
}}

Next, cut and paste the following text and comment out (#) the corresponding http repository.

{{CodeSelect|code=
#Tor Project Mirror
#deb http://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org {{Stable_project_version_based_on_Debian_codename}} main
deb http://{{Torproject_onion}}/torproject.org {{Stable_project_version_based_on_Debian_codename}} main
