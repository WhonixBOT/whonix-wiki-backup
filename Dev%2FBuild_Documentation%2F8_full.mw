[[Image:whonix.jpg|center|Whonix Concept|500px]]

Whonix (called TorBOX in past) is an anonymous general purpose operating system based on VirtualBox, Debian GNU/Linux and Tor. By Whonix design, IP and
DNS leaks are impossible. Not even malware with root privileges can find out the user's real IP/location.

This is because Whonix consists of two (virtual) machines. One machine solely runs Tor and acts as a gateway, which we call Whonix-Gateway. The other machine, which we call Whonix-Workstation, is on a completely isolated network. Only connections through Tor are possible.

Whonix is produced independently from the Tor (r) anonymity software and carries no guarantee from The Tor Project about quality, suitability or anything else.

See LICENSE in root of Whonix source for copyright, license and authors.

The Build Documentation is only interesting for developers and people who want to build Whonix from source code. If you're a user you may want to head over to the [[Download]] page.

Looking for developers! Patches and new developers highly welcome!

= Build Documentation =
== Introduction ==
This page documents how to build Whonix VirtualBox images. If you have any questions or need help, get in Contact.

It documents how to build the '''testers-only version''' of Whonix. Rather, if you are interested in building the stable version of Whonix, click [[Dev/Build_Documentation|Build Documentation]].

Knowledge assumed: basic principles of Virtualization; operation of your platform; Linux knowledge: how to install Debian and basic command line knowledge.

Only one prerequisite: you need a working internet connection.

For discussion related to the development and build process of Whonix images get
in contact.

How to use the resulting images, is documented in the [[Documentation]].

== Warning ==
* <u>'''Short'''</u>: '''Better build in a virtual machine!''' <br />''Long'':{{Code|/dev/mapper/loop0p1}} (and {{Code|/dev/nbd0}}) (used for mounting the images) is hard coded inside Whonix build scripts. Beware if you are using such devices. It may conflict with TrueCrypt. (And possibly other tools relying on {{Code|/dev/mapper/loop0p1}} (and {{Code|/dev/nbd0}}).) To avoid damage to your host system, it may be wise to build Whonix inside a Virtual Machine.
* <u>'''Short'''</u>: '''Don't add private files to Whonix's source code folder!''' <br />''Long'': Technically, it would work. Everything in whonix_gateway folder will get installed on Whonix-Gateway, whonix_workstation folder respectively, whonix_shared folder goes to both Whonix machines. This is recommended against. Those files would get managed by either the whonix-gateway-files, whonix-workstation-files or the whonix-shared-files package. When you later update Whonix debian packages, your files would get deleted by the package manager. Also adding private files to Whonix's source code folder, later contributing to Whonix's development and accidentally pushing the wrong git branch would be a disaster. Better add your private files to Whonix after building Whonix. Or add a custom build step adding your files, which then get copied from a folder outside of Whonix's source folder.
* <u>'''Short'''</u>: '''Gnome user? Please disable device auto mounter. You can do this by running the following command.''' (If you don't know if you are a Gnome user or not, just run this command, it won't hurt.) ''Long'': <ref>Otherwise a file manager may be opened while building Whonix which could lead to issues.</ref>
<pre>
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.media-handling automount-open false
</pre>
* <u>'''Short'''</u>: '''Make sure there aren't any VMs in VirtualBox already called Whonix-Gateway or Whonix-Workstation!''' <br />''Long'': <ref>Because the build script would fail, because it tries to create VMs either named Whonix-Gateway or Whonix-Workstation.</ref>
* <u>'''Short'''</u>: '''Check if the [[Dev/SourceCodeIntro#OpenPGP Keys|OpenPGP public keys]] are still up to date. If you are in luck, you never have to update the keys yourself and the Whonix maintainer will keep them updated.''' <br />''Long'': For better security.
* <u>'''Short'''</u>: '''Do not try to build Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation at the same time!''' <br />''Long'': Building Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation at the same time is not supported due to limitations in the build script. In other words, do not try to run {{Code|sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build --build --tor-gateway}} and {{Code|sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build --build --tor-workstation}} at the same time. The build would probably fail.

== Build Anonymity ==
While downloading the required tools for building Whonix your internet service provider could if he want notice that you want to build Whonix. This is especially interesting, if you want to redistribute Whonix, but still want to stay anonymous. The full story can be read in the chapter [[Build Anonymity]].

== Build Security ==
Especially, but not exclusively, if you want to distribute Whonix images, you should improve the security of your build environment.

* Build on a dedicated build system, install security updates... ([[Security Guide]])
* All installation medium<ref>Such as DVD or USB.</ref> and all downloaded/used code must be verified (including all software on the host).
* Hashes, fingerprints in the scripts and the wiki is not to be trusted. Verify everything.
* Read [[Trust]].

== Host Preparation ==
<!--
EDITORS NOTE: The following host preparation text is duplicated on 3 pages.
(1) [[Physical Isolation]]
(2) [[Dev/Build Documentation]] for VM images
(3) Whonix debian packages.
When making changes here, please consider also making changes there.
(Not using a template, because it would probably require a version specific template.)
-->
* You need to build on '''Debian Testing (Jessie)'''. (How to obtain Debian safely: <ref>[[Debian|Debian ISO OpenPGP verification]]</ref>) <ref>The build scripts could be adapted to run on other {{Code2|*NIX}} systems as well but currently they assume {{Code2|apt-get}} and {{Code2|grml-debootstrap}} to be available. You need about 15 GB of free space.</ref>
* Build dependencies and configurations get automatically applied, so you don't have to worry about that. <ref>By {{Code2|[https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/build-steps.d/1100_prepare-build-machine build-steps.d/1100_prepare-build-machine]}}.))</ref>
* It is recommended to set your terminal (for example Konsole) to unlimited scrollback, so you can watch the full build log.

== Building Whonix in Whonix ==
<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed" style="width:800px">
'''You only have to read this, if you want to build Whonix in Whonix.''' <br />
If you are interested, click on Expand on the right.
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">

Building Whonix in Whonix is possible as well (if the Whonix version you are using as host is also based on Debian Testing (Jessie)). Unfortunately, apt-cacher-ng does not like Whonix's apt repository on sourceforge.net. Adrelanos already reported a bug. As long as this bug isn't fixed or as long as we [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/105 haven't switched to apt-cacher], you need to disable Whonix's apt repository while building Whonix. You can do this using the {{Code2|whonix_repository}} tool.

== Introduction into Whonix Source Code ==
'''If you prefer to read and understand the source code just by reading scripts you may skip this optional chapter.'''

When you like to mess with the source code, it would probably help a lot if you at least know what {{Code|.img}}, {{Code|.vdi}}, {{Code|.vmdk}} and {{Code|.ova}} are being used for. See [[Dev/Source_Code_Intro|Source Code Introduction]].

== Preparation Steps ==
'''Only required if you want to redistribute (official) Whonix builds.'''

See [[Dev/Redistribution#Pre_Building|Redistribution Pre Building]].

{{Build_Documentation_Get_Source_Code}}

{{Build_Configuration}}

== VM Creation ==
If you want to build for the second time, made changes or want to build a newer version, you have to reset debian/changelog <ref>Otherwise the .deb packages would not get rebuild.</ref> and remove (or rename) any eventually already existing Whonix-Gateway and/or Whonix-Workstation in VirtualBox. Open a terminal (such as Konsole).

Reset debian/changelog.

<pre>
git checkout -- debian/changelog
</pre>

Delete eventually already existing Whonix-Gateway virtual machine. '''Warning''': This will delete a virtual machine named Whonix-Gateway from Virtual Box!

<pre>
sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build --clean --tor-gateway
</pre>

Delete eventually already existing Whonix-Workstation virtual machine. '''Warning''': This will delete a virtual machine named Whonix-Workstation from Virtual Box!

<pre>
sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build --clean --tor-workstation
</pre>

From now, you have two options. If you do not wish to use different build configurations for Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation (for example, if you do not wish to create a terminal-only Whonix-Gateway and a full Whonix-Workstation), you could use the {{Code|sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build}} wrapper script to build both virtual machines at once. If you wish to use different build configurations, you must use the {{Code2|whonix_build}} script to build one after the other as described below.

Build a Whonix-Gateway virtual machine image.

<pre>
sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build --build --tor-gateway
</pre>

Eventually, if you wish to use a different build configuration for Whonix-Workstation, change the contents in your {{Code2|/etc/whonix_buildconfig.d}} folder.

Build a Whonix-Workstation virtual machine image.

<pre>
sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build --build --tor-workstation
</pre>

The resulting {{Code2|.ova}} images can be found in {{Code|~/whonix_binary}} folder.

Check if all went ok.

Please report back any issues!

== Cleanup ==
{{Build_Documentation_Cleanup}}

== Debugging ==
'''OPTIONAL''' (Only in case something goes wrong or if you want to audit or develop Whonix.)

See [[Dev/Source_Code_Intro#Debugging|Debugging]].

== Final Steps ==
'''Only required if you want to redistribute (official) Whonix builds.'''
