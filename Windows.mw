The Whonix-Installer is the easiest way to install Whonix on a Windows system. It requires little to no input on the user's behalf and even comes with a simple interface to start and stop the Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation. Alternatively, the VirtualBox images can be downloaded [[VirtualBox#Landing|here]]. <ref>Some users report errors when using the Whonix-Installer for Windows.</ref>
