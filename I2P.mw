== I2P anonymizing network - Introduction ==
The '''Invisible Internet Project''' (I2P) is an anonymous network, exposing a simple layer that applications can use to anonymously and securely send messages to each other through "tunnels". The network itself is strictly message based (IP), but there is a library available to allow reliable streaming communication on top of it (TCP). All communication is end to end encrypted (in total there are four layers of encryption used when sending a message), and even the end points ("destinations") are cryptographic identifiers (essentially a pair of public keys).<ref>https://geti2p.net/en/about/intro</ref> This is known as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garlic_routing Garlic routing] which is a variant of Onion routing and benefits from the research on the latter but makes some different tradeoffs.<ref>https://geti2p.net/en/research</ref> Each client application has their I2P "router" that finds other clients by querying against the fully distributed "network database" - a custom structured distributed hash table (DHT) based off the Kademlia algorithm. Every router transports traffic for its peers which it uses as cover traffic for its own.

Read more about I2P's technical details [https://geti2p.net/en/docs here].

I2P is focused on creating a community around P2P darknet services rather than providing "outproxies"(exits) to the clearnet.

The I2P development [https://geti2p.net/en/about/team team] is an open group, welcome to all who are interested in [https://geti2p.net/en/get-involved getting involved], and all of the code is [https://geti2p.net/en/get-involved/develop/licenses open source]. The core I2P SDK and the current router implementation is done in Java (currently working with both sun and kaffe, gcj support planned for later), and there is a [https://geti2p.net/en/docs/api/sam simple socket based API] for accessing the network from other languages (with a C library available, and both Python and Perl in development). The network is actively being developed and has not yet reached the 1.0 release, but the current [https://geti2p.net/en/get-involved/roadmap roadmap] describes their schedule.

You can either use inproxies inside Whonix-Workstation to browse Eepsites or install I2P inside Whonix-Workstation.

The inproxy method is more suited for a causal use of I2P, where you just want to anonymously view an Eepsite and don't care about eavesdroppers as long you are anonymous.

Installing I2P inside Whonix-Workstation is safer, all I2P traffic gets tunneled through Tor, fully featured but a tiny bit more difficult than installing I2P the ordinary way, i.e. using I2P in the clear, not over Tor.

== Inproxies inside Whonix-Workstation ==

There are several I2P inproxies, those are similar to tor2web<ref>https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/tor2web</ref>. Simply use [[Tor Browser]], which comes with Whonix by default.

The hidden service search engine ahmia.fi now supports I2P eepsites and Tor2Web plans on adding I2P support.<ref>https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2016-January/039814.html</ref>

Note that you will lose the end-to-end encryption to the eepsites, which I2P would provide, if you would install it directly inside Whonix-Workstation, or if you would use it the ordinary way. Depending on if the inproxy uses http (unencrypted), http'''s''' (or is reachable through a hidden service), also [[Warning#Tor_exit_nodes_can_eavesdrop_on_communications|Exit Nodes Eavesdropping]] applies. In any case, the I2P inproxy admin can also see all of your traffic in the I2P network and there is no way to prevent that.

== Connecting to I2P through Tor ==
It is possible to run I2P inside the Whonix-Workstation.<br />
'''user -> Tor -> I2P -> Internet'''

In case you want to do that, it is recommended to read the following two related wiki articles:

* [[Tunnels/Introduction]]
* [[Tunnels/Connecting_to_Tor_before_a_proxy]]
<br />
<u>Advantages</u>:

* Anonymity is provided by Tor.
* [http://127.0.0.1:7657/confignet I2P router console] works normal inside Tor Browser. No need to install a graphical user interface on the Whonix-Gateway.
* Eepsites (.i2p) can be reached directly from Tor Browser.
* I2P's end-to-end encryption will be used like usual.

<u>Disadvantages</u>:

* Adds load to Tor.
* Adds load to I2P.
* It's slower than I2P directly on Whonix-Gateway or the ordinary usage.
* No contribution to the I2P network  (leeching). <ref>Sounds worse than it is. Only very few people are expected to use I2P over Tor. I2P offers those options itself. It's not like a leeching mod.</ref>

<u>Installation and Setup</u>:

{{Third_Party_Repository}}


''Currently supported architectures include amd64, i386, armel, armhf (for Raspbian), and powerpc.''

1. Before adding the repo<ref>https://geti2p.net/en/download/debian</ref>, fetch the key and verify<ref>https://geti2p.net/_static/i2p-debian-repo.key.asc</ref> fingerprints. Always check the fingerprint for yourself. The output at the moment is:

'''TO-DO: Update signing key info when migration from KYTV infrastructure happens.'''

<pre>
pub  4096R/0x67ECE5605BCF1346 2013-10-10 I2P Debian Package Repository <killyourtv@i2pmail.org>
      Key fingerprint = 7840 E761 0F28 B904 7535  49D7 67EC E560 5BCF 1346
</pre>

Download key with scurl to home folder.

{{CodeSelect|code=
scurl -o i2p-pubkey.asc https://geti2p.net/_static/i2p-debian-repo.key.asc
}}

Check fingerprints/owners without importing anything.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --with-fingerprint i2p-pubkey.asc
}}

If it looks good import into trusted.gpg.d.<ref>To import asc key files into trusted.gpg.d they must be converted into a .gpg keychain file first.</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring ./i2p-pubkey.gpg --import i2p-pubkey.asc
sudo cp i2p-pubkey.gpg /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/i2p-pubkey.gpg
}}

For default Whonix using Debian stable:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo su -c "echo -e 'deb http://deb.i2p2.no/ jessie main\ndeb-src http://deb.i2p2.no/ jessie main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/i2p-release.list"
}}

For Whonix build using Debian Testing or Unstable (Sid):

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo su -c "echo -e 'deb http://deb.i2p2.no/ unstable main\ndeb-src http://deb.i2p2.no/ unstable main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/i2p-release.list"
}}

[[Update]] your package lists.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}

Install I2P and dependencies.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre-headless i2p i2p-keyring
}}<ref>
[https://www.i2p2.de/debian.html I2P .deb Packages installation instructions from I2P's third party repository]
</ref>


2. Launch I2P as non-root:

{{CodeSelect|code=
i2prouter start
}}


3. {{Template:FoxyProxy}}


4. Adjust I2P Settings:

* I2P Tunnels Settings
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo sed -i "s/\(.*outbound.length=\).*/\10/g;s/\(.*inbound.length=\).*/\10/g" "/var/lib/i2p/i2p-config/i2ptunnel.config"
}}<ref>It's faster and less connection interrupts. Anonymity is already provided by Tor. No need to leech from Tor/I2P.</ref>

* I2P Router Configuration
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo su -c "cat > "/var/lib/i2p/i2p-config/router.config" << EOF
i2np.laptopMode=true

i2np.upnp.enable=false
router.isHidden=true
router.sharePercentage=0
router.updateDisabled=true
time.disabled=true
time.sntpServerList=127.0.0.1
EOF"
}}<ref>UDP is unsupported by Tor. Only outgoing TCP supported by Tor. If you know to use a hidden service, please add this information. Incoming connections are not possible, because [[Install_Software#Whonix-Workstation_is_firewalled|Whonix-Workstation is firewalled]].</ref><ref>Clock Skew Issues: There should be none anymore since Whonix 9 so configuring '''time.sntpServerList=localhost''' is no longer necessary. Please report if they occur. (Old clock skew documentation moved to [[Deprecated#I2P]].)</ref>


'''OPTIONAL'''

To run I2P as a service that automatically runs when your system boots:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo dpkg-reconfigure i2p
}}


Please review and adjust the bandwidth settings on the configuration page, as the default settings of 96 KB/s down / 40 KB/s up are fairly conservative.

= Services =

Many interesting [https://getI2P.net/en/docs/applications/supported features and functionality] are implemented for I2P in the form of stand-alone packages or plugins that can be optionally installed from their [http://i2pwiki.i2p/index.php?title=Plugins official plugin eepsite]. The instructions are simple to follow. The signing keys for these plugins is already built into the official I2P package and so are already whitelisted. This is not a complete list.

== RetroShare ==
The development of I2P's distributed forum software (Syndie) is stalled indefinitely. RetroShare is the recommended  replacement for Syndie's functionality which can be tunneled through I2P for enhanced anonymity. See [[Chat#RetroShare|installation instructions]].
