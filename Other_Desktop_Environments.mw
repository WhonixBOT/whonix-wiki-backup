= Current Situation =
[[Download]]able Whonix versions come with KDE installed by default. It is possible to uninstall KDE, although doing so is a bit difficult, especially if you want to uninstall all of it and/or to use a CLI version and/or to install their own desktop environment such as Gnome, XFCE, LXDE, etc. See [[Whonix Debian Packages]].

Users who build Whonix from source code using [[Dev/Build_Documentation|Build Documentation]] could try the [[Template:Build Documentation terminal-only|optional Terminal-Only build configuration option]]. And then decide from there, if they want to install a desktop environment and which one.

= Risks =
When installing your own desktop environment, you're on your own. In theory (also tested a little bit), everything should work except Whonix's [https://github.com/Whonix/open-link-confirmation open-link-confirmation] (asking for confirmation, if you want to open a link you click outside the browser in Tor Browser to avoid linking) and Tor Browser won't be the default browser by default. <ref>The [https://github.com/Whonix/tb-default-browser tb-default-browser] package has not been made to work / tested with Gnome yet.</ref>

Other desktop environments install other background services. We haven't researched the privacy implications of having these installed. For example, Gnome automatically installs [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoClue GeoClue]. (Whonix prevents installation of that very package, but still...) And comes with a different collection of default applications that have not necessarily been checked for privacy. For example, Thunderbird/TorBirdy (as explained on the [[E-Mail]] page) is the only recommended mail client. Installing your own desktop environment may result in installing KMail, which is not recommended, since there is no TorBirdy-like extension for KMail.

= Future =
<s>At the moment unfortunately, "Whonix should support other desktop environments" is a synonym for "Patrick should support other desktop environments". Due to time constrains it won't be possible for Whonix developer Patrick Schleizer to maintain a second desktop environment next to maintaining the KDE desktop environment.</s>

Since Whonix is an Open Source / Free Software project, Whonix developers are hoping that other developers join the project and maintain other desktop environments. That someone could be you?
