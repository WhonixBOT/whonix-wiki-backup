= Current Situation =
[[Download]]able {{project name}} versions are available with

* [[VirtualBox/XFCE|XFCE]]
* or [[VirtualBox/CLI|CLI]] (no desktop environment).

= Risks =
When installing your own desktop environment such as GNOME, you're on your own. If you are going that path, start with {{project name}} CLI and install the desktop environment there. This is much better than starting with {{project name}} XFCE and then uninstalling XFCE to install another desktop environment.

In theory (also tested a little bit), everything should work except {{project name}} [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/open-link-confirmation open-link-confirmation] (asking for confirmation, if you want to open a link you click outside the browser in Tor Browser to avoid linking) and Tor Browser won't be the default browser by default. <ref>The [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/tb-default-browser tb-default-browser] package has not been made to work / tested with Gnome yet.</ref>

Other desktop environments install other background services. We haven't researched the privacy implications of having these installed. For example, Gnome automatically installs [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoClue GeoClue]. ({{project_name}} prevents installation of that very package, but still...) And comes with a different collection of default applications that have not necessarily been checked for privacy. For example, Thunderbird/TorBirdy (as explained on the [[E-Mail]] page) is the only recommended mail client. Installing your own desktop environment may result in installing KMail, which is not recommended, since there is no TorBirdy-like extension for KMail.

= Future =
Since {{project name}} is an Open Source / Free Software project, {{project name}} developers are hoping that other developers join the project and maintain other desktop environments. That someone could be you?
