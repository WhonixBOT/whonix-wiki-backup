= What are DisposableVMs? =

In the Qubes TemplateVM model, <ref>[https://www.qubes-os.org/getting-started AppVMs (qubes) and TemplateVMs] </ref> any changes made to a [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/2489 root filesystem of a TemplateBasedVM] are lost upon reboot. This is advantageous for several reasons: it saves time and disk space, and allows faster, centralized updates for applications that are usually found inside the root filesystem. However, certain directories are designed to persist between reboots in order to store files and settings. These directories are stored in <i>/rw/</i> and include <i>/home/user</i> as well as additional directories defined by "bind directory" settings. <ref>[https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/bind-dirs/ How to make any file in a TemplateBasedVM persistent using bind-dirs]</ref>

Qubes does not have a built-in snapshot capability like VirtualBox that can completely revert all changes back to a previous VM state. <ref>
Apart from [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/dom0-tools/qvm-revert-template-changes/ qvm-revert-template-changes] which can only revert to the state existing before the last shutdown of the TemplateVM.
</ref> <ref>
[https://forums.whonix.org/t/qubes-vm-snapshots-using-git-svn Qubes VM snapshots using git / SVN].
</ref> In other words, no method exists within AppVMs to reverse changes made to the persistent file system  without implementing some type of custom solution. To ensure that ''all'' filesystem changes are discarded after a session, Qubes offers DispVMs. When a DispVM is shutdown, the VM is removed from Qubes and all related VM images are deleted from the host filesystem. This method is [[Qubes/Disposable_VM#Disposable_VMs_are_not_Amnesic|not yet amnesic]] and should not be relied upon for anti-forensics!

While DispVMs ensure that files do not persist without user intervention, the downside is the user can no longer decide whether or not the current VM state should be kept or destroyed; users must choose beforehand to use a standard AppVM or a DispVM.

{{Qubes persistence}}

== The Layered DisposableVM System ==
Qubes uses a two-layered approach to DispVMs. At the core of the system is a ''TemplateVM'' upon which a ''[https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/glossary/#dvm-template DVM Template]'' is based. Every time a new DispVM is launched it is based on the ''DVM Template'' - hence, two layers. In a standard Qubes-Whonix installation:

* The Whonix-Workstation default TemplateVM is <code>{{whonix-ws}}</code>. 
* The Whonix-Workstation default DVM Template is called <code>{{whonix-ws-dvm}}</code>.
* Each Whonix-Workstation default DispVM (<code>disp1, disp2, ...</code>) is based on <code>{{whonix-ws-dvm}}</code>. 

Once a DVM Template is created, its <i>/home/user/</i> directory can be customized <ref>https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/dispvm-customization/</ref> independently of the TemplateVM. In this special case, the DVM Template will continue to inherit changes from the base TemplateVM's root filesystem (like package updates), but user files in <i>/home/user/</i> will persist independently.

It is possible to have multiple DVM Templates and DispVMs at the same time. <i>Any</i> TemplateBasedVM can be enabled for use as a template for DispVMs, by setting its [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/dispvm-customization/ <code>template_for_dispvms</code>] property.

In Qubes R4, Qubes-Whonix 14's default DVM Template (<code>{{whonix-ws-dvm}}</code>) can be easily created [[#Setup|using salt]] and will have this property set.

== DisposableVM Traffic is Stream Isolated from Other VMs ==

DispVMs work especially well with Whonix-Gateway. <ref>Because each VM is assigned a unique internal IP address.</ref> All DispVM traffic is [[Stream_Isolation|stream-isolated]] from the traffic of other VMs running in parallel.

== Avoid Ephemeral Whonix-Gateway ProxyVMs ==

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text       = Using disposable Whonix-Gateway ProxyVMs in Qubes R4 makes the user ''less'' anonymous due to the configuration having [[Tor_Entry_Guards#Configure_Non-Persistent_Entry_Guards|non-persistent entry guards]]!
}}


Some Whonix users have the mistaken belief that DispVMs for both the Whonix Gateway and Workstation in Qubes R4 is the ultimate configuration: increasing their security, without any corresponding privacy downside. This reasoning is incorrect for the following reasons: <ref>[[Qubes/DisposableVM#Warning:_DisposableVMs_are_not_Amnesic|DisposableVMs are not Amnesic]].</ref> <ref>https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/904</ref> <ref>[[Tor#Entry_Guards|Tor Entry Guards]].</ref>
* DispVMs are not amnesic. In practice this means traces of their activity can be left on storage or in memory, making them vulnerable to forensic operations. <ref>This is another reminder of why full disk encryption should always be used on the host.</ref>
* Using a DispVM for the Whonix-Gateway results in non-persistent entry guards to the Tor network; behavior unlike the default configurations for Whonix, Tor, and the Tor Browser Bundle. Mathematically speaking, end-to-end correlation attacks are ''more'' likely to succeed when a user chooses many random entry and exit points to the Tor network, rather than semi-permanent entry guards which are only rotated every few months. <ref>https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8240</ref> <ref>The reason is there are both malicious and benign guards in the Tor network. The more often the user "rolls the dice" (changes guards), the greater the chance of striking out.</ref>

The solution to the first problem is only allowing [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/904 in-RAM execution of DisposableVMs], but this is not planned for implementation in the short-term. There is no perfect solution to the second problem. That said, there is an actual unstated security-privacy trade-off by running this configuration. Theoretically, an ephemeral Whonix-Gateway ProxyVM is only able to be infected for a single session (via the ''/home'', ''/usr/local'' and ''/rw'' directories), since it is discarded upon shutdown. This provides a counterbalance to the increased threat of malicious guards, as [https://tails.boum.org/blueprint/persistent_Tor_state/ Whonix becomes more "Tails-like"].

== Check the Tor Browser Version ==
{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text    = When using DispVMs, use the [[Tor_Browser#Tor_Browser_Internal_Updater|Tor Browser Internal Updater]] daily to check the browser is up-to-date!
}}


To learn about recent Tor Browser versions, follow [https://blog.torproject.org The Tor Project blog] or look at raw data for the latest [https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/RecommendedTBBVersions Recommended TBB Versions]. Tor Browser's version number can also be checked manually: <code>Tor Browser</code> -> <code>Menu</code> -> <code><u>H</u>elp</code> -> <code>About Tor Browser</code>. See [[Qubes/Disposable_VM#Updating_Tor_Browser|Updating Tor Browser]] for more information.

Note that keeping Tor Browser updated in a (customized) DispVM can be difficult for several reasons, but it is necessary; see footnote. <ref> These references may have less relevance following the release of Qubes R4 and Qubes-Whonix 14, and equally applies to future releases:
* https://forums.whonix.org/t/using-whonix-workstation-as-a-disposablevm-dispvm/2461/21
* https://forums.whonix.org/t/qubes-dispvm-technical-discussion/3232/11</ref>

== DisposableVMs are not Amnesic ==
{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text       = 
All changes to a DispVM's file system are discarded upon shutdown. However, DispVMs are similar to snapshots insofar as they can leave traces of their activity on storage and in memory. <u>These traces may be later recoverable through data forensics.</u> 
}}


This is further justification for using [[Full_Disk_Encryption_and_Encrypted_Images#Full_Disk_Encryption_on_the_Host|full disk encryption]] on the Qubes host and completely shutting down the system when it is not in use. Laptop users may wish to remove batteries to ensure that power to the RAM is definitely disconnected. <ref>[[Warning#Whonix_is_not_amnesic | Whonix is not amnesic.]]</ref> <ref>[[FAQ#Is_there_a_Whonix_Amnesic_Feature_.2F_Live_CD_.2F_Live_DVD.3F_What_about_Forensics.3F | Is there a substitute for Whonix's lack of an Amnesic feature?]]</ref> <ref>[https://groups.google.com/d/topic/qubes-devel/QwL5PjqPs-4/discussion DisposableVMs do not run entirely in RAM].</ref> <ref>[https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/904 DisposableVMs: support for in-RAM execution only (for anti-forensics) #904]</ref> <ref>
[https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/3037 4.0rc1 dirty shutdown causes dispVMs to remain persistent #3037]
</ref>

== DisposableVMs may be Linkable to other VMs Connected to the Same Whonix-Gateway ==

The Tor Project developer Teor has stated that [[Tor]] caches {{Code|DNS, HS descriptors, pre-emptive circuits, etc.}} <ref>https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2016-October/011591.html</ref> which may lead to linkage between AppVMs and DispVMs sharing the same gateway. The extent to which this is a threat for Whonix users is still being investigated. <ref>[https://phabricator.whonix.org/T567 Multi GW Documentation].</ref>

== Do not Start Tor Browser in a DVM Template ==
For reasons why, see: [[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#Running_Tor_Browser_in_Qubes_TemplateVM|Running Tor Browser in Qubes TemplateVM]].

Only start Tor Browser in TemplateBased AppVMs or DispVMs, see: [[#Start_Tor_Browser_in_a_DisposableVM|Start Tor Browser in a DisposableVM]].

== Do not Start Tor Browser Updater in a DVM Template ==
For reasons why, see: [[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#tb-updater_in_Qubes_DVM_Template|tb-updater in Qubes DVM Template]].

Instead, run [[#Keep Tor Browser Up-to-date|Tor Browser Downloader]] by Whonix developers in Whonix-Workstation TemplateVM (<code>{{whonix-ws}}</code>).

== Use Caution when Spawning DisposableVMs from Other VMs  ==
{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text       = 
If a DispVM is created from within a VM that is not connected to Whonix-Gateway, the new DispVM may route its traffic over clearnet. <ref>DispVMs are created in one of two ways: 
* <code>Open in DisposableVM</code>. On the command line (domU), run. {{CodeSelect|code=qvm-open-in-dvm}}
* <code>Run in DisposableVM</code>. On the command line (domU), run. {{CodeSelect|code=qvm-run --dispvm}} </ref> 
}}


The reason is because DispVMs inherit their NetVMs from the calling VM, or the calling VM's <code>dispvm_netvm</code> setting (if different). The <code>dispvm_netvm</code> setting can be configured per VM via: 

<code>dom0</code> -> <code>Qubes VM Manager</code> -> <code>VM Settings</code> -> <code>Advanced</code> -> <code>NetVM for DisposableVM</code> <ref>On the command line (dom0), run. {{CodeSelect|code=qvm-prefs -s vmname dispvm_netvm sys-whonix}} </ref> 

If the calling VM is connected to Whonix-Gateway, this step is not necessary and the DispVM's traffic will be routed over Tor. See: [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/1954 Whonix default NetVM settings fixes].

= Setup =
'''Note:''' Examples below reference GUI steps whenever possible, but Qube Manager configuration options in R4 are limited in comparison to earlier releases. <ref>For instance, DispVM networking can no longer be set from Qube Manager.</ref> Where relevant, additional command line commands are listed in the footnotes.

== Creating Whonix Default DVM Template Based on Whonix-Workstation ==

'''1.''' [[Qubes/Update|Update]] Qubes-Whonix.

'''2.''' Open a dom0 terminal.

<code>Qubes App Launcher (blue/grey "Q")</code> -> <code>System Tools</code> -> <code>Konsole or Xfce Terminal</code>

'''3.''' Create <code>{{whonix-ws-dvm}}</code> DVM Template.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo qubesctl state.sls qvm.whonix-ws-dvm
}}

Qubes-Whonix DispVMs are now ready for use.

== Creating a Named Whonix DispVM Based on Whonix-Workstation ==

{{mbox
| type      = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text       = Nearly all users can skip this step. A specific use case for DispVM naming conventions has not (yet) been identified. 
}}


Do ''not'' include <code>-dvm</code> when naming DispVMs! Tor Browser will not be inherited from Whonix-Workstation TemplateVM (<code>{{whonix-ws}}</code>) if this advice is ignored.

To create a DispVM called <code>anon-whonix-disp</code> based on the {{whonix-ws-dvm}} Template, in dom0 run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
qvm-create -C DispMV -l red --template {{whonix-ws-dvm}} anon-whonix-disp
}}

Launch Konsole in the DispVM.

{{CodeSelect|code=
qvm-run -a anon-whonix-disp konsole
}}

TODO: Investigate use cases for this procedure.

== Deleting a DVM Template ==
If a DVM Template has been customized and the user wishes to revert these changes, a DVM Template can be deleted the same way as any other VM.

Note the DVM Template cannot be deleted while it is the default DispVM of another VM, otherwise an error message appears. In that case, follow tips found [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/3993 here] on how to manually change the default DispVM of VMs to another setting, then repeat the procedure.

<code>dom0</code> -> <code>Qube Manager</code> -> <code>right-click '{{whonix-ws-dvm}}'</code> -> <code>left-click 'Remove VM'</code>
<ref>Or on the command line (dom0), run. {{CodeSelect|code=qvm-remove <vmname>}}</ref>

== Customizing DVM Templates ==

Extra caution must be exercised when customizing a DVM Template. <ref>Qubes documentation: [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/dispvm-customization DisposableVM Customization]</ref> From a privacy perspective, it is ideal to have a DVM Template that is indistinguishable from any other Whonix-Workstation. If changes are made to the DVM Template, these may link all of the DispVMs via a uniquely generated fingerprint should they be compromised independently. Risky changes include, but are not limited to:

* Installation of obscure programs;
* Uncommon configuration settings; or 
* The placement of unique data files. 

Always keep in mind the DispVM will likely be exposed to the greatest Internet threats. Further research is required to confirm whether file timestamps installed by `apt-get update` constitute a unique fingerprint. <ref>TODO: Investigate the potential threat.</ref>

Tor Browser is specifically designed to prevent website fingerprinting or identification based on the user's browser [[Fingerprint|fingerprint]]. It is safest to run Tor Browser in its stock configuration so the fingerprint is [[Data_Collection_Techniques#Fingerprinting_and_Anonymity|less unique]], due to commonality with the larger Tor Browser user pool. Each individual browser change can significantly worsen the fingerprint because of the associated entropy, <ref>33 bits of entropy will identify one individual out of several billion.</ref> so only make alterations if the impacts are known. See also: [[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#tb-updater_in_Qubes_DVM_Template|tb-updater in Qubes DVM Template]].

A decision must be made in advance whether to disable JavaScript by default. There is a [[Tor_Browser#Security_vs_Usability_Trade-off|usability-security trade-off]] to consider: fingerprinting and usability is worsened by disabled JavaScript, but this provides better protection against vulnerabilities. Conversely, enabled JavaScript improves usability and increases the risk of exploitation, but the browser fingerprint is (likely) more common.

== Customizing Tor Browser in DVM Template ==

For most users, Tor Browser customizations in the DVM Template or TemplateVM are discouraged. Advanced users who wish to customize the DVM template despite the risks should follow [[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#DVM_Template_Customization|these steps]].

== Customizing Applications other than Torbrowser in DVM Template ==

{{mbox
| type      = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text       = Customization is completely optional. Only files in <i>/home/user</i> (or more generally, in <i>/rw</i>) can be customized in a DVM Template.
}}


'''1.''' Launch the application in the DVM template.

Either open dom0 terminal and run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
qvm-run -a {{whonix-ws-dvm}} <app>
}}

Or use Qube Manager:

<code>dom0</code> -> <code>Qube Manager</code> -> <code>right-click '{{whonix-ws-dvm}}'</code> -> <code>Run command in qube</code> -> <code>type name of the <app></code>

'''2.''' Customize application settings.

Customize the application as per normal procedures.

'''3.''' Exit the application.

If required, save application-specific settings, then exit the application so settings are stored on the disk.

'''4.''' Shutdown the DVM template.

Either use a dom0 terminal.

{{CodeSelect|code=
qvm-shutdown {{whonix-ws-dvm}}
}}

Or use Qube Manager:

<code>dom0</code> -> <code>Qube Manager</code> -> <code>right-click '{{whonix-ws-dvm}}'</code> -> <code>left-click 'Shutdown VM'</code>

The changes will be available when the DispVM is restarted.

== Keep Tor Browser Up-to-date ==
To obtain the latest Tor Browser, the simplest method is to use Whonix's built-in Tor Browser downloader functionality. Simply update using [[Tor_Browser#Tor_Browser_Downloader_by_Whonix|Tor Browser Downloader by Whonix (tb-updater)]] in Whonix-Workstation TemplateVM (<code>{{whonix-ws}}</code>) when performing your usual maintenance [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/whonix/update/ upgrading]:

<code>Qubes App Launcher (blue/grey "Q")</code> -> <code>{{whonix-ws}}</code> -> <code>Konsole</code> <ref>
<code>dom0</code> -> <code>Qubes VM Manager</code> -> <code>right-click on '{{whonix-ws}}'</code> -> <code>click 'Run command in VM'</code> -> <code>type 'konsole'</code>
</ref> <ref>
On the command line (dom0), run.
{{CodeSelect|code=
qvm-run -a {{whonix-ws}} konsole
}}</ref>

{{Update}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}

Upgrade.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
}}

If Tor Browser is not upgraded, use {{Code2|update-torbrowser}} to download a new copy.

Launch Tor Browser Downloader by Whonix and follow the instructions. <ref>
{{CodeSelect|code=
update-torbrowser
}}
</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
update-torbrowser --input gui
}}

Shutdown the DVM Template: <ref>
On the command line (dom0), run.
{{CodeSelect|code=
qvm-shutdown {{whonix-ws-dvm}}
}}
or<br />
DVM Template command line (domU), run. {{CodeSelect|code=
sudo poweroff
}}
</ref>

<code>dom0</code> -> <code>Qubes VM Manager</code> -> <code>right-click on '{{whonix-ws-dvm}}'</code> -> <code>click 'Shutdown VM'</code>

== Updating a DVM Template ==
Changes to the underlying TemplateVM (<code>{{whonix-ws}}</code>) are detected automatically and the DVM Template is updated without user intervention. That means package updates that are applied to <code>{{whonix-ws}}</code> are also applied to the <code>{{whonix-ws-dvm}}</code>.

= Usage =
DispVMs are well-suited for risky and largely independent activities, like web browsing or opening untrusted files. In contrast, AppVMs might be better suited for activities necessitating file persistence, like email clients with local email storage.

With either kind of VM, Qubes' VM integration tools like secure file copy <ref>Qubes documentation: [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/copying-files/ Copying and Moving Files Between Domains]</ref> and secure clipboard <ref>Qubes documentation: [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/copy-paste Copying and Pasting Text Between Domains]</ref> ensure that clean, trusted files and text can be easily and safely transferred to trusted VMs (if necessary).

== User Tips ==
=== Data Storage ===
In Qubes, it is unrecommended to store any valuable data in an untrusted VM. This perspective is reinforced by the Tor Browser design which similarly does not remember bookmarks or credentials. Best practice is to store sensitive data in an offline vault VM; for instance, when accessing passwords with a password manager. 

@rustybird has announced a new "split-tor-browser" <ref>[https://github.com/rustybird/qubes-split-browser Github: Split Browser]</ref> package that can retrieve urls and credentials from a trusted VM for use in a DispVM's browser. This package is yet to be tested or endorsed by Whonix, but it looks promising.

=== DispVM Shutdown ===
A DispVM automatically shuts down when the <u>first</u> user-launched process is terminated. For example, if a new DispVM is created by launching Tor Browser and a user simultaneously starts typing in an editor later on, all this work will be lost after Tor Browser is closed. To avoid this, first launch a terminal in the DispVM and then launch additional applications from the terminal. This way the DispVM is only destroyed after exiting the terminal.

=== Offline DispVMs ===
{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text       = '''Warning:''' Use utmost caution if deciding to re-establish network connectivity for off-line DispVMs! No mechanism is currently available to prevent connections to a clearnet NetVM.
}}


Non-networked DispVMs are useful for opening untrusted files that potentially might try to use the network maliciously. Like all Qubes VMs, the NetVM for a DispVM can be changed dynamically while the VM is still running. Simply set the NetVM to "none" using the Qubes VM Manager or the command line interface. <ref>On the command line (dom0), run.{{CodeSelect|code=qvm-prefs disp<1 {{!}} 2 {{!}} ...> netvm none}}</ref> 

=== Shortcuts ===

* DispVMs can be created directly by launching programs from the application menu using shortcuts; [[#Adding_a_Desktop_Shortcut|see below for instructions]]. 
* DispVMs can also be spawned by using context-menus or the command line interface in other AppVMs. Refer to the [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/dispvm/ Qubes DisposableVM documentation] for instructions on different methods.
* Note the [[#Use_Caution_when_Spawning_DisposableVMs_from_Other_VMs|relevant warning]] concerning shortcuts in this chapter.

== Adding a Desktop Shortcut ==

# From the Qubes application menu, drag and drop a menu item onto the desktop.
# Double-click the newly created launcher to start it.
# At first start, it is safe to click "Mark Executable".

== Adding an XFCE4 panel shortcut ==

From the Qubes application menu, drag and drop a menu item onto the panel.

== Start Tor Browser in a DisposableVM ==

Tor Browser can be started via the GUI or on the command line. 

To use the GUI: <br />
<code>Qubes App Launcher (blue/grey "Q")</code> -> <code>Disposable: {{whonix-ws-dvm}}</code> -> <code>Tor Browser (AnonDist)</code>

To launch from the dom0 command line, run.
{{CodeSelect|code=
qvm-run --dispvm={{whonix-ws-dvm}} torbrowser
}}

After launch, ''always'' first [[Qubes/DisposableVM#Warning:_Check_the_Tor_Browser_Version|check the Tor Browser version]]!
