Unless purchasing [[Professional Support]], please do not ask very basic questions.

Examples of very basic questions:

* How to update {{project name}}?
* How do I run {{project name}} on Windows?
* How does VirtualBox work?
* How do I do X on OS Y?

Please first use search engines and see [[Documentation]] before asking.

This is because:

* {{project name}} is a technological means to anonymity, but staying safe necessitates complete behavioral change; it is a complex problem without an easy solution. The more you know, the safer you can be.
* Some answers to these questions are already available in documentation.
* The quality of answers in the documentation is higher than a rehash posted in a causal chat.
* Some of these topics are deemed too generic and out of scope for {{project name}} and require the user to acquire a basic prerequisite knowledge of computing elsewhere before attempting anything further.
* Much development effort is made to configure safe defaults but operations security (opsec) is not merely throwing a toolbox to someone. Staying safe requires a change of mindset and these skills which unfortunately cannot be readily gained without the user doing some legwork and educating themselves. Due to the complexity of the subject, it will be impossible to find someone volunteering too assist through every step of the journey and learning curve. Advanced questions about {{project name}} usage in cases not already documented are welcome however and can be answered if time and energy permit.
