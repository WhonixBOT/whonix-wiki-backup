= Selection of Platforms =
== Account Creation ==
An account will most likely be created, when...

Criteria:

* The platform must be somewhat popular or show potential to become somewhat popular. <ref>
This is a somewhat arbitrary determination and not too much time is spent on research.
</ref>
* Easy sign-up.
* Legal.

Non-Criteria:

* Networks respects privacy of its users.
* Tor users are permitted to sign-up.
* Anonymous sign-up permitted.
* Other ethical or political considerations.
* In an ideal world, "perfectly moral" decisions would be made but that is deemed impractical. For elaboration, see [[Warning#Unsubstantiated_Conclusions|unsubstantiated conclusions]]. <ref>
In that case most major networks could not be used because most fail in one regard or another. Therefore no such attempt is being made.
</ref>

Reasons for account creation:

* Reserving account name.
* Censorship resistance.
* Escaping (potential) shadow banning.
* Decentralization, diversity.
* Allowing users to choose their favorite network.

Non-Reasons for account creation:

* Endorsing that network.

== Criteria for which Social Networks accounts are most actively used ==
Amended <code>October 24, 2020</code>.

* Usability. The easier it is to (auto) post to these networks, i.e. post 1 time using an (external or third party such as IFTT) tool and then spread to multiple networks, the more likely this network is going to see more posting activity.
* Depends on contributor time and availability to mirror posts to these networks.

== Criteria for Footer Inclusion ==
Amended <code>October 24, 2020</code>.

Criteria for (wiki) [[Template:footer|footer]] inclusion:

* platforms self-hosted by {{project name}} (discourse forums, newsletter, rss)
* third party platforms:
** popular, generally active or followed by our user community regardless of whether based on Freedom Software or non-freedom software
** promising platforms that have the potential to grow or are in an expansion phase
* experimentation
* technical merit (decentralized and/or censorship-resistant)

= End-to-End Encrypted Public Chat =
Unavailable.

* blocker: {{project_name}} matrix chat is bridged to {{project_name}} telegram chat. Meaning, any messages on matrix and telegram gets relays. (As long as the free relay bot service is functional.) Matrix channel encryption is incompatible with relaying to Telegram.
* Other reasons:
** It's a public chat anyhow. Anyone can join telegram and view that chat history.
** No clear threat model.
** Lower maintenance effort.
