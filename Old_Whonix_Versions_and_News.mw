== Source for downloaded image ==

The scripts used to build a certain downloaded version of a TorBOX-Gateway or TorBOX-Workstation image can be '''also''' found in the VM at /usr/share/doc/torbox (in TorBox 0.2 at /usr/local/bin/tor-*) and through the wiki history.

== TorBOX 0.1.3 (old, outdated, released) ==

TorBOX 0.1.3, which was '''released''' as build from source and download version.

It no longer builds, due to breaking changes from Tor 0.2.2 to Tor 0.2.3.

== TorBOX 0.2.0-debootstrap (only development version) ==

There was also an attempt by '''anonymous''' to build TorBOX 0.2.0-debootstrap. It has been dropped because there were too many issues. The open issues are noted within the files. '''Never released.''' If anyone wants to continue working on it that's certainly possible, let's discuss this on Whonix/Dev then.

== TorBOX 0.2.0-no-network-while-preseeding (only development version) ==

Based on TorBOX 0.2.0-debootstrap, there was also an attempt by '''adrelanos''' to create TorBOX 0.2.0-no-network-while-preseeding, which failed. '''Never released.''' (The goal was to save time while installing/preseeding.) That attempt failed, because of an issue with grub, see [https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-grub/2012-07/msg00008.html Wrong root device when using update-grub inside chroot (building VM images)] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6Fg1AjpT9 w]). Another issue was a limitation in preseed, see [http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2008/12/msg00159.html Problem trying to preseed netcfg/no_interfaces] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6Fg1BaR16 w]). Build documentation was never written but the build script was self explanatory. If anyone wants to continue working on it that's certainly possible, let's discuss this on Whonix/Dev then.

Introduced fully automated build system based on bash scripts, grml-debootstrap and chroot.

'''2012-09-28'''

{{project_name}} '''ALPHA''' version '''0.4.4''' has been released and is ready for testing. There some usability bugs inside, but workarounds are available in this readme. Since it is an alpha version, there can be further unknown bugs.

I did not want to delay this release any further. The mess with multiple project names and websites had to come to an end. I've seen people loosing interest in open source projects, because there was no visible progress. This is no vaporware. Changelog: [[Changelog]]

'''2012-09-05'''

<sup>1</sup> A bug in aos 0.2.1 when trying to update Tor has been [https://sourceforge.net/p/torbox/discussion/general/thread/e938932d/ reported]. The bug has been confirmed by aos developer adrelanos. Thanks to the anonymous user for reporting the bug and for testing the workaround! You can find the workaround under [[Deprecated#Updating Tor|Updating Tor]].

<sup>2</sup> I am still having problems with the new webhost. Aos development made steady progress (see in [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/{{project_name_short}} git] if you are interested). The project is still very active and I am still interested and going to develop it further. One the webhost problem has been fixed, the 0.3.0 will be released.

'''2012-07-17'''

<sup>1</sup> Rebranding. '''aos''' is the new project name. The process of rebranding is ongoing. Also all links have to be renamed. That will be done as soon as a new home for aos has been found.

<sup>2</sup> A aos (previously called TorBOX) source code 0.2.1 is now on [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/{{project_name_short}} github]. The source code will be polished so it will be easier to understand, maintain and contribute. The â€‹devel branch contains latest changes.

'''2012-07-16'''

<sup>1</sup> TorBOX 0.2.1 has been released. It is Alpha quality software. There were no testers besides '''proper'''. You can download it. While this release contains many security enhancements, new minor usability bugs have been introduced. See [[Changelog]] for a comprehensive list of changes and known issues. '''adrelanos''' decided to release this even with the minor bugs since the security improvements are important. <sup>2</sup> The gnome-terminal has a minor bug, at startup the it is black on black, therefor you can't see anything. Simply change the colors manually.

<sup>3</sup> '''proper''' has a new pseudonym, '''adrelanos'''.

<sup>4</sup> Due to [https://www.torproject.org/docs/trademark-faq.html.en trademark issues], TorBOX must be rebranded. TorBOX needs a new name, and a new home, a new website. Stay tuned for updates.

'''2012-07-14'''

TorBOX 0.2.1 will come out soon. Before officially releasing it, I'd like to have a few testers. If you are interested, please contact adrelanos a-t riseup do-t net.

'''2012-06-14'''

A bad news and a good news.

<sup>1</sup> Unfortunately, the upcoming download version, TorBOX 0.2.0, will not be functional on older hardware with non-PAE CPU's.

<sup>2</sup> Fortunately, users with non-PAE CPU's, will still be able to build TorBOX 0.2.0 from source. The situation may improve in future. The [[FAQ]] has been updated.

'''2012-06-02'''

<sup>1</sup> The latest TorButton update may break Tor Browser within TorBOX. We'll post soon an update with a solution. The Readme explains how you can update Tor Browser.

<sup>2</sup> A bug crashing TorBOX has been [http://ra.fnord.at/2011/05/easy-and-secure-anonymous-internet-usage/ reported offsite]. It happens when you try to run TorBOX on older hardware, which does not support PAE. A new [[FAQ#{{project_name}} crashes because of PAE?|FAQ entry]] with a interim solution has been posted. The bug will be fixed in TorBOX 0.2.0. UPDATE: Unfortunately will only partially fixed, see news above.

'''2012-05-29'''

<sup>1</sup> The New Identity button of Tor Button in Tor Browser with TorBOX is defunct. See [[Tor Browser#New Identity Button]] for an explanation why, what the New Identity button does and for a workaround.

'''2012-05-21'''

<sup>1</sup> New article: All about [[Browser Plugins]] (such as Flash) in conjunction with TorBOX.

'''2012-04-25'''

<sup>1</sup> New optional feature. You can use a Secondary DNS resolver (Optional Feature).

'''2012-04-24'''

<sup>1</sup> New optional feature. There is now a limited workaround for Tunneling UDP over Tor using VPNs.

'''2012-04-10'''

We have a bunch of new/updated articles/stuff. Here is a selection.

<sup>1</sup> new: Rudimentary TorBOX Support for Other Anonymizing Networks. (People who are only interested in Tor, do not have to read.)

<sup>2</sup> updated: TorBOX/SecurityAndHardening.

<sup>3</sup> new: TorBOX/Trust.

<sup>4</sup> updated: Tunneling Proxy/SSH/VPN through Tor (Tor &rarr; Proxy/SSH/VPN).

<sup>5</sup> new: A Free example VPN working with TorBOX for testing purposes.

<sup>6</sup> new: Tunneling UDP over Tor (Update: see news)

<sup>7</sup> Optional new feature: Hide your TorBOX usage / Torify the Tor-Gateway

<sup>8</sup> Dev only: Hardened Gentoo based Tor-Gateway

'''2012-04-02'''

<sup>1</sup> '''Critical issue''' with /var/lib/tor for all users who downloaded the TorBOX Download Binary images 0.1.3. Users who manually configured TorBOX or used build from source are not affected.

On your Tor-Gateway. 1. If you were using onion services, backup your keys (/var/lib/tor/hidden_service/). 2. Execute the following:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo -i
}}
{{CodeSelect|code= 
service tor stop
}}
{{CodeSelect|code=
rm -r /var/lib/tor/*
}}
{{CodeSelect|code=
service tor start
}}
{{CodeSelect|code=
exit
}}
This will delete the content of the Tor data directory /var/lib/tor. Technical background: the Tor consensus and your [https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#EntryGuards entry guards] are stored there. These should not be shared along all TorBOX users.

'''2012-03-25'''

<sup>1</sup> Binary images for TorBOX 0.1.3 are now available! These are affected by the critical issue above.

'''2012-03-24'''

<sup>1</sup> All users should update to 0.1.3!
Users of TorBOX 0.1.* can update using the update script. Users of TorBOX versions prior the introduction of version numbers should reinstall following our build instructions or Physical Isolation instructions. Update: or download the latest ready-made images.

'''2012-03-22'''

<sup>1</sup> TorBOX has now a logo. Thanks to XJ!

'''2012-03-06'''

<sup>1</sup> Identity correlation through circuit sharing (Update: This is now closed, there is nothing we can do about till the current alpha version of Tor becomes stable; Update 2: TorBOX is already working with the current Tor alpha and prepared for the next Tor stable, see tor-gateway.sh.)

'''2012-03-03'''

<sup>1</sup> Alpha builds available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/torbox/files/

'''2012-02-16'''

<sup>1</sup> This is resolved in the latest version of TorBOX. Resolved in TorBOX 0.1.3 and above. Only important prior TorBOX 0.1.3. It would be prudent if all TorBOX users would use the same time zone, as some applications do leak it, this hasn't been advised earlier. Do this on your Tor-Workstation and on your Tor-Gateway. Type in console

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
}}
then choose etc (at the bottom) and then choose UTC.

<sup>2</sup> new: Hosting onion services

'''2012-01-11'''

<sup>1</sup> Project started. [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorBOX?action=history Historical] very [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorBOX?version=1 first version].
