<blockquote>
To protect against time zone leaks, the system clock inside {{project name}} is set to UTC. This means it may be a few hours before or ahead of your host system clock. <u>Do not change this setting!</u>
</blockquote>

= Change System Timezone =
{{project name}} specific part: To prevent package [https://gitlab.com/whonix/anon-apps-config anon-apps-config] from changing the timezone to UTC during upgrades, create either file <code>/etc/noutc</code> or <code>/usr/local/etc/noutc</code>. <ref>
https://gitlab.com/whonix/anon-apps-config/-/commit/85dcdaaeafe150a740949d5b8d167e6f0fa10c7d

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo touch /etc/noutc

{{CodeSelect|code=

{{project name}} unspecific part: Time zone can be adjusted as per [[Free Support Principle]].

Note: system timezone as configured <code>/etc/timezone</code> / <code>/etc/localtime</code> is a "system setting". What (Xfce) graphical user interface clock widget is showing and its setting might be independent from the "system setting" since that is a "user setting".

= Timezone vs sdwdate =
[[sdwdate]] is mostly unrelated. It can operate independently of system timezone setting. It is a time synchronization daemon. It does not alter the system timezone.
