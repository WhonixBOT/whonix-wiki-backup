= Introduction =

The ZeroNet wiki describes the software design: <ref name=Zeronet_wiki>https://zeronet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</ref>

<blockquote>[https://zeronet.io/ ZeroNet] uses Bitcoin cryptography and BitTorrent technology to build a decentralized censorship-resistant network.

Users can publish static or dynamic websites in ZeroNet and visitors can choose to also serve the website. Websites will remain online even if it is being served by only one peer.</blockquote>

This means users are not identified or reachable by an IP address, since they are identified by a public key - specifically a public Bitcoin address. The private key owner can sign and publish changes, which are propagated through the network. Sites are accessed through an ordinary browser in combination with the Zeronet application. <ref>ZeroNet acts as a local web server for these pages.</ref> The BitTorrent technology refers to the use of trackers to negotiate peer connections. <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZeroNet</ref> ZeroNet can be optionally configured to use Tor for anonymity. <ref>https://zeronet.io/docs/faq/#how-to-use-zeronet-with-tor</ref>

The Zeronet wiki describes various features and benefits, including: <ref name=Zeronet_wiki />

* Password-less authorization - the user account is protected by the same cryptography that applies to Bitcoin wallets.
* Easy setup. <ref>Although the Chinese government has blocked the ZeroNet website and bittorrent tracker.</ref>
* Immediate updating of sites in real time.
* Works with any browser.
* Full Tor network support, including onion services.
* Content cannot be censored (removed) after publication. 
* It is impossible to shut down content, since content is served by any user who wishes to.
* ZeroNet is fast and works offline.

= Connecting to Tor before ZeroNet =

These instructions lead to the following connection scheme in Whonix:

'''<code>User</code> -> <code>Tor</code> -> <code>ZeroNet</code> -> <code>Internet</code>'''

= Installation =
=== onion-grater Adjustments ===
Complete the following steps in {{gateway_product_name}} (<code>sys-whonix</code>).

{{Control_Port_Filter_Python_Profile_Add
|filename=/usr/share/onion-grater-merger/examples/40_zeronet.yml
|filename_new=/usr/share/doc/onion-grater-merger/examples/40_zeronet.yml
}}

=== Modify Firewall Settings ===
Modify the {{workstation_product_name}} (<code>anon-whonix</code>) user firewall settings and reload them.

{{Firewall Settings Workstation}}

Add.

{{CodeSelect|code=
EXTERNAL_OPEN_PORTS+=" 15441 "
EXTERNAL_OPEN_PORTS+=" 33750 "
}}

Save.

{{Reload_Firewall_ws}}

=== Install Dependencies ===

To download and verify ZeroNet via git, run the following commands in {{workstation_product_name}} (<code>{{whonix-ws}}</code>) terminal.

{{Update}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}

Install <code>git</code>, <code>python-msgpack</code> and <code>python-gevent</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install git python-msgpack python-gevent
}}

=== Install ZeroNet ===
ZeroNet is not yet packaged for Debian, so it must be manually installed. <ref>https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/241</ref> <ref>http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=850474</ref>

[[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]]: This step can be completed in the ZeroNet qube (AppVM; <code>anon-whonix-zeronet</code>).

Retrieve the ZeroNet signing key. <ref>https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/759</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --recv-keys "960F FF2D 6C14 5AA6 13E8 491B 5B63 BAE6 CB96 13AE"
}}

Download ZeroNet.

{{CodeSelect|code=
git clone https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet.git
}}

Navigate to the ZeroNet folder.

{{CodeSelect|code=
cd ZeroNet
}}

Check the ZeroNet signature.

{{CodeSelect|code=
git log --show-signature
}}

= Launch ZeroNet =
[[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]]:

{{CodeSelect|code=
./zeronet.py --tor always --fileserver_ip $(qubesdb-read /qubes-ip)
}}

[[{{non q project name short}}|{{non q project name}}]]:

{{CodeSelect|code=
./zeronet.py --tor always --fileserver_ip 10.152.152.11
}}

----

{{Tor_Browser_Start}}

----

{{Template:TBB_localhost}}

----

Navigate to the ZeroNet web interface. Paste http://127.0.0.1:43110 into Tor Browser's URL field and press enter. For additional tips on visiting sites, see: [https://zeronet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#how-does-it-work How does it work?]

The process is now complete and ZeroNet should be fully functional in {{project_name}}. <ref>Functionality was last confirmed in May 2018.</ref>
