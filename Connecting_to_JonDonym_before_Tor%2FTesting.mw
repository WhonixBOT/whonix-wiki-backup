== JonDonym Setup ==
'''Testers only!'''

It is possible to configure Tor to use JonDo as proxy to establish the following tunnel:<br />
'''User &rarr; JonDonym &rarr; Tor &rarr; Internet'''

If you want to do this, apply the following instructions.

[[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]] only! [[{{non q project name short}}|{{non q project name}}]] is [[FAQ#What_do_you_mean_by_unsupported.3F|unsupported]].

No JonDo premium account required. Works with JonDo free.

Create a new standalone ProxyVM called JonDo-Gateway.

Install JonDo in your new JonDo-Gateway ProxyVM. To do that, the following instructions will install JonDo from JonDo's Debian APT repository:<br />
https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/help/firststeps2.html Installation method using chapter {{Code2|Using the repository at command line}} is recommended.

After you installed JonDo in your JonDo-Gateway ProxyVM, test if JonDo's https proxy is functional.

{{CodeSelect|code=
curl {{Curl Secure}} --proxytunnel --proxy 127.0.0.1:4001 https://check.torproject.org
}}

<ref>
Socks proxy test - premium only.

{{CodeSelect|code=
curl {{Curl Secure}} --socks5-hostname socks5h://127.0.0.1:4001 https://check.torproject.org
}}
</ref>

You need to enable the extended view.

<pre>
Config &rarr; user interface &rarr; extended view.
</pre>

You must make JonDo listen on all interfaces so it will be reachable from sys-whonix. Under network, __un__check:<br />
<code>[ ] Allow access to JAP/JonDo from localhost only (recommended)</code>

In JonDo-Gateway ProxyVM, {{Firewall Unload Home Folder}}

IP Forwarding in the JonDo-Gateway ProxyVM could/should be disabled since it is not required. TODO: document how

Shut down sys-whonix. Set sys-whonix NetVM to JonDo-Gateway. Restart sys-whonix.

In sys-whonix. {{Open_/usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf}}

Add the following. 10.137.10.1 is just an example. You need to replace 10.137.10.1 with the IP of your JonDo-Gateway ProxyVM. You could run the following command within sys-whonix to find out the IP of your JonDo-Gateway ProxyVM.
<code>qubesdb-read /qubes-gateway</code>

<pre>
HTTPSProxy 10.137.10.1:4001
</pre>

Save.

{{Reload Tor}}

In sys-whonix, test if Tor is able to the https proxy that JonDo is providing.

{{CodeSelect|code=
{{Curl Plain}} {{Curl Secure}} --socks5-hostname socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050 https://check.torproject.org
}}

Done. Tor will use JonDo as proxy.

== JonDonym as Tor replacement (JonDoBOX) ==

Was just a development idea with some progress. Moved to [[Dev/Inspiration]].
