= Introduction =

In this chapter, the term ''fingerprint'' refers to the specific way {{project name}} behaves on the Internet. Those specificities could be used to determine whether a particular user is running {{project name}} or not.

As explained on the [[Warning]] page, the default {{project name}} configuration does not hide Tor use from network observers. However, the {{project name}} design attempts to make {{project name}} users indistinguishable from the rest of the Tor population, particularly Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) <ref name="tbb" /> users. If {{project name}} and TBB <ref name=tbb>TBB stands for [https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en Tor Browser Bundle]. It is included in {{project_name}}, see [[Tor Browser]].</ref> users have distinct fingerprints, then this information significantly degrades anonymity because the {{project name}} user base is far smaller than the broader Tor population. <ref>Certainly less than 50,000 users, although [https://phabricator.whonix.org/T689 an exact figure] is yet to be published.</ref>

This section briefly addresses possible {{project name}} fingerprinting issues and how adversaries might use this information to verify {{project name}} is in use.

}}

Various types of information can be leaked about the user's browser, (host) operating system and hardware depending on the external party in question.

== Entry Guards or Bridges ==

As noted in the [[Tor_Entry_Guards#Guard_Fingerprinting|Guard Fingerprinting]] chapter, using persistent Tor guards or bridges can threaten anonymity under certain circumstances:

<blockquote>
While natural guard rotation is recommended, there are some corner cases in which an adversary could fingerprint the entry guards and de-anonymize a user. For instance:<br />
* The same entry guards are used across various physical locations and access points.
* The same entry guards are used after permanently moving to a different physical location.
</blockquote>

For example, if an adversary monitoring network activity observes a user connecting from multiple physical locations with persistent guards/bridges, then it can be reasonably assumed that all connections stem from the same person. Mitigating this risk requires techniques like using new Tor entry guards or configuring alternate bridges for different places.

Nick Mathewson from The Tor Project suggests additional precautions when moving networks: <ref>[https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-September/005424.html tor-dev: entry guards and linkability]</ref>

* [[MAC_Address|Spoof the MAC address]] with randomized values on each move.
* Absolutely prevent non-Tor connections.
* Ensure a unique set of Tor entry guards (bridges) is utilized for each network you connect from. <ref>Note: this is not a recommendation for non-persistent guards because a hostile DHCP server might provide new IPs until a hostile guard is chosen.</ref>
* Minimize the threat of stored Tor state files which record every network visited.

{{Anchor|ISP fingerprint}}

== ISP or Local Network Administrators ==

The capabilities of the ISP or local network administrator are difficult to ascertain with complete certainty. This is still a general research question for The Tor Project, and not {{project name}} developers. It is also impossible to prove a negative.

Firstly, {{project name}} solely generates Tor activity on the network. All traffic from both the {{workstation_product_name}} (<code>{{whonix-ws}}</code>) and {{gateway_product_name}} (<code>{{whonix-gw}}</code>) such as TBB <ref name="tbb" />, updates, and sdwdate pass through Tor. Establishing an online connection is the task of the host, so the host <ref>In case of Default/Download version, it is the host's task to establish an online connection. In the case of [[PhysicalIsolation|Physical Isolation]], it is the gateway's task to establish an online connection. </ref> is most likely using DHCP to obtain a local IP address. <br />

In contrast, usually TBB <ref name="tbb" /> users have additional network activity outside of Tor, either from another web browser or other applications. This means the proportion or volume of Tor activity might be feasible identifiers to determine whether a user is running {{project name}} or the TBB <ref name="tbb" />. It is probably harder for the ISP to determine whether a single user is solely generating Tor traffic (and potentially using {{project_name}}) if:

* The Internet connection is shared with other users that do not run {{project_name}}.
* A browser is also used on the host. <ref>This comes with the attendant risk of the user confusing one browser with another.</ref>
|-
! scope="row"| Tor Entry Guards
| {{project_name}} uses an unmodified version of Tor, <ref>[[FAQ#Does_{{project_name_short}}_Modify_Tor.3F | {{project name}} uses an unmodified version of Tor]]</ref> so [[Tor_Entry_Guards|entry guards]] are used as the default mechanism to connect to the Tor network. <ref>https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#EntryGuards</ref> Consequently, a Tor user will maintain the same relay as the first hop for an extended period, <ref>Typically the entry guards are rotated after a few months.</ref> which is a security feature. 

One addition which is unique to {{project name}} is its Tor configuration <ref>https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/anon-gw-anonymizer-config</ref> for the <code>Stream Isolation</code><ref>[[Stream Isolation]]</ref> security feature.
|-
! scope="row"| Time Synchronization
| When {{project name}} is started, the system clock is synchronized to make sure it slightly differs from the host clock via <code>[[sdwdate]]</code>. <code>[[whonixcheck]]</code> also issues some network traffic to check for updates and news, which all passes through different circuits. This behavior might be specific to {{project_name}}. <ref>It is unknown if an ISP can detect whether a user has many different Tor circuits open. On the other hand, Tor seems to only open X entry guards and maintain them for a period, thus not opening as many entry guards as streams.</ref>
|-
! scope="row"| [[Fingerprint#Website Traffic Fingerprinting|Website Traffic Fingerprinting]]
| Website traffic fingerprinting is also an open Tor research question, which is unspecific to {{project_name}}. <ref>See [https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/ Tor Browser Design] for further exploration of this issue.</ref> A related and unresearched issue is whether fingerprinting risks also apply to other traffic, such as <code>apt-get</code> traffic.
|}

In conclusion, the ability of the ISP or local network administrator to distinctly identify users who utilize TBB, {{project_name}}, Tails, a custom transparent Tor proxy or similar project, depends on how well Tor actually works. As {{project name}} is exclusively generating Tor activity on the network and relies on Tor to obfuscate that traffic, the answer depends on Tor itself and resolution of open research questions.

== Visited Websites ==

Destination websites can retrieve [[Data_Collection_Techniques|a lot of information]] about a user's browser and system, while [[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#Adversary_Attack_Capabilities|advanced adversaries]] have even greater capabilities. <ref>Information that is leaked depends on the browser in use, JavaScript settings, Tor Browser's security slider settings, whether it is a malicious attack or not, and other factors.</ref> This information can include: 
<div style="column-count:2;-moz-column-count:2;-webkit-column-count:2">
* The browser name and version.
* CSS media queries:
** Window dimensions.
** Desktop size.
** Widget size.
** Display type.
** DPI.
* A list of available extensions.
* Timezone. <ref>Via the date object.</ref>
* Available fonts.
* User agent.
* Video card in use. <ref>Via WebGL</ref>
* CPU and interpreter speed.
* Browser history. <ref>For example, using CSS and JavaScript to perform history disclosure attacks.</ref>
* Via exploited plugins:
** Leak the non-Tor IP address.
** Interface addresses and other machine information. 
** List all plugins to fingerprint the user.
** Retrieve unique plugin identifiers.
* Read / store identifiers related to HTTP auth, DOM storage, cached scripts, client certificates and TLS session IDs.
* Browser cache.
</div>
To make it difficult to distinguish {{project name}} and TBB <ref name="tbb" /> users, TBB <ref name="tbb" /> is included on the platform. Therefore, {{project name}} should provide the same information as TBB <ref name="tbb" /> in order to generate very similar fingerprints.

= Website Traffic Fingerprinting =
Quote research paper by University of Waterloo, [https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/10123 Website Fingerprinting: Attacks and Defenses]:

<blockquote>
Website fingerprinting attacks allow a local, passive eavesdropper to determine a client's web activity by leveraging features from her packet sequence. These attacks break the privacy expected by users of privacy technologies, including low-latency anonymity networks such as proxies, VPNs, or Tor. As a discipline, website fingerprinting is an application of machine learning techniques to the diverse field of privacy. To perform a website fingerprinting attack, the eavesdropping attacker passively records the time, direction, and size of the client's packets. Then, he uses a machine learning algorithm to classify the packet sequence so as to determine the web page it came from.
</blockquote>

In simpler terms, any observer between the user and a Tor relay can see to what website a user is connecting. This includes the user's the internet service provider (ISP). The observer won't know the exact contents of the internet connection (such as user names, passwords, etc.) but the observer can know with reasonable certainty that a specific website (such as for example <code>google.com</code>) has been visited. Website fingerprinting attacks are possibly also applicable to Tor [[Bridges|bridges]]. That depends on the adversary's capability to detect Tor bridge traffic as well as on how well [https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports.html.en pluggable transports] can [[Hide_Tor_and_Whonix_from_your_ISP|hide]] Tor and resist website fingerprinting.

The blog post by [https://www.torproject.org/ The Tor Project], [https://blog.torproject.org/new-low-cost-traffic-analysis-attacks-mitigations New low cost traffic analysis attacks and mitigations] ([https://forums.whonix.org/t/new-low-cost-traffic-analysis-attacks-and-mitigations/8708 forum discussion]) discusses [[Fingerprint#Website_Traffic_Fingerprinting|website fingerprinting]].
