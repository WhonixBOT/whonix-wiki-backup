= Introduction =

Secure Shell (SSH) is a core tool in a sysadmin's arsenal and provides a secure and encrypted connection and method of communication between a client user and a server. It is mainly used to remotely control a machine. In the Linux landscape, the package OpenSSH is one of the most popular and complete choices to enable communication via SSH. Newcomers to SSH should first consult the [https://wiki.debian.org/SSH Debian SSH wiki] to learn the basics.

= Secure SSH Client and Server Settings =

There is a client package and a server package, <code>openssh-client</code> and <code>openssh-server</code>. As the time of writing, Debian buster is using OpenSSH version 7.9. That version will be the focus of these instructions. Covered topics include:

# Key generation for authentication/sign-in purposes.
# Suggested secure settings for both the client and server configurations.
# A sample set of iptables rules to allow communication between client and server.

== Key Generation ==

Before you can connect to a server (or host) through SSH, a keypair is required. This consists of a public key, which you share with the server, and a private key which is used to verify that you are actually signing in. A passphrase (strongly recommended) can be added to your key which will be asked each time you sign into a server.

Once the server has your public key, it is placed into an <code>authorized_keys</code> file. The private key is not shared with anyone and should be kept in a safe place -- it typically resides at <code>/home/username/.ssh/private-key</code> on the client's machine with root permissions (0600). The private key is how the server authenticates your username.

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Generate the SSH keypair.

Use a tool called "ssh-keygen". On the command line, type.

{{CodeSelect|code=
ssh-keygen -o -a 75 -t ed25519
}}

* <code>-o</code> produces a key that is compatible with OpenSSH instead of the older style <code>.pem</code>.
* <code>-a</code> refers to the number of rounds of KDF (key derivation function). This strengthens the key against a brute force attack to break the passphrase if the (private) key were to be stolen. A value of 75 to 100 is more than adequate. Remember that the more rounds that are specified, the longer it takes to authenticate (sign in). This depends on your CPU, your workload at the time of sign in, the amount of cores, and available memory among other factors.
* <code>-t</code> specifies what type of key to generate. The choices are: <code>rsa</code>, <code>ecdsa</code> and <code>ed25519</code>. RSA and ECDSA are older keys, and OpenSSH recommends <code>ed25519</code> as the best choice.

'''2.''' Store the SSH keypair.

Upon generation of your keypair, OpenSSH will ask if the keys should be stored at: <code>/home/your-username/.ssh</code>; reply <code>yes</code>. Permissions will be automatically set in Debian, but there have been reports of wrong permissions on certain other distributions. For reference, the correct permissions are as follows:

* for the public key, <code>0644</code> is needed; and
* for the private key <code>0600</code> (root) is vital.

Having too lax permissions will prevent logins and cause unwanted errors.

'''3.''' Copy the key to the server you want to sign into.

This only needs to be done once per server. The <code>ssh-copy-id</code> command works for this task, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/public-key.pub user@host
}}

<code>user</code> is your username and <code>host</code> is the name/address of the server. Only copy the public key. It ends with <code>.pub</code>.

The ssh-copy-id utility will check for the correct permissions before it allows the key to be transferred.

'''4.''' Login to the server.

Once copied to the server, you can now login anytime with:

{{CodeSelect|code=
ssh user@host
}}

If you chose a passphrase for your key, you will be asked to enter it now.

The keypair generation procedure is now complete. You have successfully generated a keypair and sent your public key to your chosen server.
}}

== Client and Server Configuration File Settings ==

The next step is to set up secure settings for the client and server configuration files. Examples will be given for both client and server. The relevant files are: <code>/etc/ssh/ssh_config</code> and <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>.

=== Client Configuration File ===

Warnings:

* Changing the sshd configuration can prevent future successful SSH connections to your servers.
* It is probably best to only set this up for new servers or if you do not mind re-installing the server should you lock yourself out.
* If a server console interface (ability to run repair commands from server host web administrator interface) is available, it is certainly far less risky to make huge changes to the ssh configuration.
* Do not proceed without a backup of the server and knowledge of how to restore the server should anything go wrong.
}}

Prerequisite knowledge:

* How to open a terminal (emulator) such as xfce4-terminal.
* How to open two terminal emulators or multiple terminal emulator tabs at the same time.

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Open at least two SSH connections in two different terminal (tabs). 

One is used as a backup should the SSH connection be accidentally closed in the middle of the setup.

'''2.''' View the fingerprint of the server's ed25519 public key. 

Fine hosting providers will also show the server fingerprint in the server web interface.

{{CodeSelect|code=
ssh-keygen -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub
}}

'''3.''' Restart the sshd server.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl restart sshd
}}

Existing SSH connections should not be interrupted by Debian default. 

'''4.''' Open a new terminal (tab) and see if you can still SSH to the server. 

If yes, proceed.

'''5.''' ''Note:'' When using the configuration file below, the following warning might appear. IP address and SHA256 hash will be different.

<pre>
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @

Please contact your system administrator.
Add correct host key in /home/user/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
Offending ECDSA key in /home/user/.ssh/known_hosts:35

</pre>

'''6.''' Make a backup of the old SSH configuration file.

{{CodeSelect|code=
cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config_backup
}}

'''7.''' View the backup file <code>/etc/ssh/ssh_config_backup</code> with a text editor to check if the backup was successful.

'''8.''' Clear contents of <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
echo "" {{!}} sudo tee /etc/ssh/sshd_config
}}

'''9.''' Open file <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> with root rights.

Paste the following contents.

<pre>
## Protocol 1 is dangerously outdated!

* If it does not work, use your still open terminal to check for configuration errors before trying again.
}}

=== Notes ===

Those are the completed SSH configuration files. Please note that the entries preceded by a <code>#</code> are not necessary for functional use; they are included only as examples of what is possible in SSH. If you do not have a specific use for any of the commented out options in either configuration file, do not use them at all.

The Ciphers, MACs and Kex algorithms are all the strongest possible at the time of writing with OpenSSH version 7.9 on Debian buster. The entries in the configuration files above are the most important and will establish a functional and well-guarded setup. Use ed25519 keys only -- rsa and ecdsa are outdated. Use the <code>ssh-keygen</code> command to generate the keys.

The <code>VisualHostKey yes</code> entry in the <code>/etc/ssh/ssh_config</code> file is so when you login, openssh shows you an ascii-generated picture of what the key looks like. In addition to all the other verifications, this is one last line of defense to alert you to a changed or wrong key.

Generally the newer OpenSSH versions will choose the strongest cipher on their own when negotiating a connection, but the configuration files establish in what order they are parsed. Both sides need to have the same or compatible openssh versions and cipher, mac, and kex algorithm options.

== Firewall Settings and Rules ==
{{Testers-Only}}

It is necessary to make specific firewall rules for your intended SSH activity. For example, if you wanted to connect to a server at <code>123.45.678</code> and both your configuration and the server's configuration specify port <code>4675</code> to communicate over:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -o [interface-name] -s [your client ssh ip] -d [ssh server ip] --dport 4675 --j ACCEPT
}}

Then to let them respond:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -i [interface-name] -s [ssh server ip] -d [your client ip] --dport 4675 --j ACCEPT
}}

This assumes a default-deny policy for INPUT and OUTPUT. If you have a default-allow for OUTPUT, then the following rule must be added as the last one in the OUTPUT chain:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT --j DROP
}}

This ensures the outgoing rules you have are the only ones that allow traffic. Iptables parses in order, so when it does not see a rule matching a packet not on your list, it checks each one in the chain until it finds a match with the last rule and drops the packet. Also, SSH only uses the TCP protocol, so no UDP rules are explicitly needed.

This should complete the SSH setup. Some people also recommend re-generating the moduli file that comes in <code>/etc/ssh</code>. If you use the settings above, look at the kex algorithms. Since no diffie hellman group exchange kex algorithms are used to exchange keys, it is unnecessary to regenerate the moduli. The chosen kex algo is curve25519.
