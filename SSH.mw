SSH is a core tool in a sysadmin's arsenal. It is mainly used to remotely control a machine.

Use stronger ssh keys.

{{CodeSelect|code=
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
}}

Prefer SSH servers available through a [[Onion Services|Tor Onion Service]] for stronger encryption and authentication. Tor also provides NAT hole-punching so you don;t need to register with a DNS service nor open up your LAN to outside access.

Any references to SSH breaks in the Snowden archives applied to some outdated ciphers. This has since been addressed by hardened OpenSSH settings (which are included in Whonix) and upstream disabling vulnerable algorithms.<ref>https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/112802/why-openssh-deprecated-dsa-keys</ref><ref>https://stribika.github.io/2015/01/04/secure-secure-shell.html</ref>

[https://packages.debian.org/jessie/mosh mosh] might be useful, however since it requires UDP, using it over Tor is non-trivial, see [[ Tunnel UDP over Tor]].

Beware of keyboard keystroke and computer mouse based deanonimization as explained under [[Surfing Posting Blogging]].
