Use stronger ssh keys.

{{CodeSelect|code=
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
}}

Prefer SSH servers available through a [[Onion Services|Tor Onion Service]] for stronger encryption and authentication.

[https://packages.debian.org/jessie/mosh mosh] might be useful, however since it requires UDP, using it over Tor is non-trivial, see [[ Tunnel UDP over Tor]].

Beware of keyboard keystroke and computer mouse based deanonmization as explained under [[Surfing Posting Blogging]].
