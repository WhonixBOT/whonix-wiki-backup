}}

= Change the User Interface Language =
== Introduction ==
Because Whonix is nothing special and based on Debian GNU/Linux and KDE, you are free to change the system language. The technical steps are the same. You could also refer to Debian or KDE upstream documentation. If you are happy with the default English, you do not have to do anything.

== System ==
=== All Languages ===
(1) Open a terminal. (For example: Konsole)

<pre>
Start menu -> Applications -> System -> Terminal.
</pre>

(2) [[Update]] the package lists.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}

(3) Search for available language packs.

{{CodeSelect|code=
apt-cache search kde-i18n
}}

Or [http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=kde-l10n&searchon=names&suite=stable&section=all search the Debian package archive].

(4) Install a language pack.

Example, replace the -ar with your language!

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install kde-l10n-ar
}}

(5) Change setting in KDE.

<pre>
Start menu -> Applications -> System -> System Settings -> Locale -> Languages -> Change Language
</pre>

=== Russian ===
(1) Open a terminal. (For example: Konsole)

<pre>
Start menu -> Applications -> System -> Terminal.
</pre>

(2) Reconfigure locales.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
}}

(3) You will see the list of enabled and available locales. You need to leave only two of them: the English and the Russian. They are as follows:

en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8
ru_RU.UTF-8 UTF-8

Untick/disable all other locales if they are enabled, because if you have other Russian locales enabled you will get ??????? (questions) characters instead of the Russian letters while typing in the terminal/konsole.

(4) Reboot Whonix-Workstation for the made changes to take effect.

=== Korean ===
User contributed instructions originally posted in [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/fff34595/ Whonix Forum - Korean language support] by Anonymous. You can also use that thread for support questions.

(1) Open a terminal. (For example: Konsole)

<pre>
Start menu -> Applications -> System -> Terminal.
</pre>

(2) Update the package list.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}

(3) View available language packs.

{{CodeSelect|code=
apt-cache search kde-i18n
}}

(4) Install Korean language pack.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install kde-l10n-ko
}}

(5) Install Korean fonts.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install ttf-unfonts-core ttf-unfont-extra
}}

(6) Open system settings and set eungulim as kde's font.

(7) Open konsole and

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
}}

(8) Set "''ko KR.UTF-8 UTF-8''" as Default locale.

(9) Install nabi.

{{CodeSelect|code=
apt-get install nabi
}}

(10) Restart your Whonix-Workstation and start nabi.

(11) Done. You can write and read Korean now.

== Tor Browser ==
=== Introduction ===
Using <u>one</u> of these methods is sufficient to change the language in [[Tor Browser]].

=== Method 1 - Config File Method ===
Complete this method in the Whonix-Workstation.

Available Tor Browser languages as of April 2017:

<pre>
ar
de
en-US
es-ES
fa
fr
it
ja
ko
nl
pl
pt-BR
ru
tr
vi
zh-CN
</pre>

To check if further languages are supported visit https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/ Binaries and supported language packs are listed by Tor Browser version. The nomenclature for language packs is classified according to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes|ISO 639-1 codes].

{{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/torbrowser.d/50_user.conf
}}

And add for example.

{{CodeSelect|code=
TB_LANG="vi"
}}

Replace "vi" with "zh-CN" for Chinese and so on.

Save.

After changing this setting, use [[Tor_Browser#Tor_Browser_Downloader_by_Whonix|Tor Browser Downloader by Whonix]] to install a new version. Afterwards, Tor Browser will support your native language.

=== Method 2: Mozilla Firefox Add-on ===
Complete these steps in Whonix-Workstation.

'''1. Start Tor Browser'''

'''2. Check Tor Browser's Firefox ESR Version'''

<code>Tor Browser</code> -> <code>Help</code> -> <code>About Tor Browser</code>

The output should be something like: <code>45.9.0</code>.

'''3. Install a Language Pack'''

Visit https://download-origin.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/firefox/releases/45.9.0esr/linux-i686/xpi/ and install the required language pack.

Note: <code>45.9.0</code> in the above URL needs to be changed to match the Firefox ESR version Tor Browser is based on.

'''4. Restart Tor Browser'''

Tor Browser will now default to the user's native language.

=== Method 3 - Debian Iceweasel Add-on Method ===
In your Whonix-Workstation.

'''Please TEST and leave feedback.'''

(1) Update the package lists.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}

(2) Search for available language packs.

{{CodeSelect|code=
apt-cache search iceweasel-l10n-
}}

(3) Install a language pack.

Example, replace the -ar with your language!

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install iceweasel-l10n-ar
}}

(4) Change setting in Tor Browser.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo find /usr/lib/iceweasel/extensions -maxdepth 1 -name 'langpack*.xpi' -exec ln -s '{}' /home/user/tor-browser_en-US/Data/profile/extensions/ ';'
}}
