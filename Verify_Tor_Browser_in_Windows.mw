<pre>
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
</pre>

The above message can be ignored as it does not alter the validity of the signature related to the downloaded key.

To remove this warning, the Tor Browser developer's signing key must be personally signed with your own key.
