=== Mounting (CD/DVD) Devices ===
<!--T:240-->

<!--T:241-->
You can use the following workaround.

<pre>
sudo mkdir /mnt/cdrom
</pre>

<pre>
sudo mount -o ro /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom/
</pre>

<!--T:242-->
Using the <b>ro</b> flag will mount the CD/DVD read-only.

<!--T:244-->
Help fixing this bug is welcome! ([https://phabricator.whonix.org/T139 ticket])

=== VLC / Video Player Crash ===
<!--T:245-->


<!--T:246-->
You can use this workaround.
<pre>
VLC -> Tools -> Preferences -> Video -> Output -> X11 -> Save
</pre>

== Minor ==
=== libtorsocks Warning ===
During running apt-get dist-upgrade, you may see a warning similar to the following one.

<pre>
15:36:37 libtorsocks(12225): sendmsg: Connection is a UDP or ICMP stream, may be a DNS request or other form of leak: rejecting.
Cannot talk to rtnetlink: No such file or directory
acpid: error talking to the kernel via netlink
</pre>

Sounds scary, but is of no concern. See footnote for technical explanation. <ref>
This is because in order to implement [[Stream Isolation]], Whonix's apt-get [https://github.com/Whonix/uwt uwt] wrapper forces apt-get through torsocks. Unfortunately, not only apt-get is forced through Tor, but also sysvinit and subsequently all daemons sysvinit is restarting. acpi_fakekey daemon uses local connections. Those will be rejected by torsocks. The worst that can happen is that acpi_fakekey won't operate until manually restarted. This is a bigger issue for web servers and alike, because those may not function until manually restarted.

This will likely be fixed as soon Whonix will be based on Debian jessie, because that uses systemd, that is not affected by this as well as torsocks 2.0 may solve this.

=== "apt-get source package" will show "dpkg-source: warning: failed to verify signature" ===
<!--T:109-->
This is not a security issue. It is only a warning. More info [http://lists.debian.org/debian-derivatives/2013/08/msg00000.html here] (and in the following mails).

If you want, you can get rid of it with the following workaround.

<!--T:110-->
1. Modify <code>/etc/dpkg/origins/default</code>.

<pre>
sudo unlink /etc/dpkg/origins/default
sudo ln -s /etc/dpkg/origins/debian /etc/dpkg/origins/default
</pre>

2. {{Code|apt-get source package}}

<!--T:250-->
3. Undo afterwards to prevent unexpected issues.

<pre>
sudo unlink /etc/dpkg/origins/default
sudo ln -s /etc/dpkg/origins/whonix /etc/dpkg/origins/default
</pre>

=== Proxychains Tor Browser Issue ===
Want to use proxychains for the connection scheme user -> Tor -> proxy? This currently won't work. For more information, see [[Tunnel_Proxy_or_SSH_or_VPN_through_Tor#Tor_Browser]].
