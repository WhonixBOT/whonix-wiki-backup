It's recommended at least to read Whonix Important Blog if you are in a hurry. Have a look into Whonix Feature Blog if you are generally interested to learn about anonymity/privacy/security related things or to see what's going on with Whonix.

== Operating System Updates ==
<!--T:42-->
You should regularly check for operating system updates on your host operating system, on Whonix-Workstation and on Whonix-Gateway as highly recommended in the [[Security Guide|Security Guide]].

== Tor Browser ==

There is no auto-update feature for Tor Browser. You will be notified about new Tor Browser versions by [[whonixcheck|whonixcheck]]. Tor Browser's built in update check mechanism also works in Whonix. For instructions how to update the browser, see [[Tor Browser|Tor Browser]].

== Normal ==
=== KEYEXPIRED Error ===
You might see this error when attempting to [[Security_Guide#Updates|update]] existing Whonix versions (build version 9.4 and below.)

<pre>
W: GPG error: http://sourceforge.net wheezy Release: The following signatures were invalid: KEYEXPIRED 1421449064 KEYEXPIRED 1421449064 KEYEXPIRED 1421449064 KEYEXPIRED 1421449659 KEYEXPIRED 1421449659 KEYEXPIRED 1421449064 KEYEXPIRED 1421449064 KEYEXPIRED 1421449064 KEYEXPIRED 1421449659 KEYEXPIRED 1421449064 KEYEXPIRED 1421449064 KEYEXPIRED 1421449064 KEYEXPIRED 1421449659
</pre>

To fix this issue, open a terminal

<pre>
fpr="916B8D99C38EAF5E8ADC7A2A8D66066A2EEACCDA"
gpg --recv-keys "$fpr"
gpg --fingerprint "$fpr" 
gpg --export "$fpr" | sudo apt-key add -
</pre>

Then [[Security_Guide#Updates|update your system]] as usual.

After that you will be able to [[Tor_Browser#Update_Tor_Browser|update Tor Browser]] as well.

It will be fixed out of the box in Whonix 9.6 and above.

{{Anchor|Tor Browser Startup Issues - Needs Workaround}}

=== Tor Browser Startup Issues ===
This has been fixed out of the box in Whonix 9.3 and above.

After the upgrade to Tor Browser 4.x, it can be no longer started.

Whonix's stable repository contains a fix. [[Security_Guide#Updates|Upgrade]]. After upgrading, reboot is required. <ref>So [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor] environment variables changes take effect to fix the ControlPort quotes warning.</ref>

Forum discussion:<br />
https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,636.0.html

=== Connection Issues - Tor stops working after an Upgrade and needs a Workaround ===
This is [https://www.whonix.org/blog/whonix-9-2-maintenance-release fixed in Whonix 9.2] above.

In Whonix 9... When upgrading to Tor 0.2.5.8-rc-1~d70.wheezy+1 (using sudo apt-get dist-upgrade) in Whonix 9, your Tor connection may go down. There is a workaround.

Open {{Code2|/etc/apparmor.d/local/system_tor}}.

<pre>
## If you are using a graphical Whonix-Gateway, use:
kdesudo kate /etc/apparmor.d/local/system_tor

## Or alternatively, if you are using a terminal-only Whonix-Gateway, use:
sudo nano /etc/apparmor.d/local/system_tor
</pre>

Scroll down until you see.

<pre>
/usr/bin/obfsproxy rix,
</pre>

Comment out (by adding a # in front of it).

<pre>
#/usr/bin/obfsproxy rix,
</pre>

Then reboot.

<pre>
sudo reboot
</pre>

You should keep that in mind. When Whonix fixes that bug, you'll get an interactive dpkg conflict resolution dialog. This is explained in [[Security Guide#Updates]]. Just choose to install the new {{Code2|/etc/apparmor.d/local/system_tor}} file then.

=== Mounting (CD/DVD) Devices ===
<!--T:240-->

<!--T:241-->
You can use the following workaround.

<pre>
sudo mkdir /mnt/cdrom
</pre>

<pre>
sudo mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom/
</pre>

<!--T:242-->
The following message.

<pre>
mount: block device /dev/sr0 is write-protected, mounting read-only
</pre>

<!--T:243-->
Is expected. (It's normal that CD/DVD's are mounted read-only.)

<!--T:244-->
Help fixing this bug is welcome! ([https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/168 github ticket])

=== VLC / Video Player Crash ===
<!--T:245-->


<!--T:246-->
You can use this workaround.
<pre>
VLC -> Tools -> Preferences -> Video -> Output -> X11 -> Save
</pre>

== Minor ==
=== AppArmor Warning during Boot ===
If you wonder during boot about following warning.
<pre>
Warning /etc/apparmor.d/... network rules not enforced.
</pre>

[[File:apparmor_warning.png]]

This is not a security issue. Whonix installs [[AppArmor]] and the [https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/apparmor-profiles apparmor-profiles] package by default, but does not enforce AppArmor by default. We are not there yet and Debian also does not enforce AppArmor by default yet either. The apparmor-profiles package gets installed by default for better usability, to make enforcing AppArmor easier. This warning only reflects, that the profile is not enforced by default.

Debian bug report:<br />
[http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=774888 please provide an option to hide or deactivate all the noisy, scary warnings during boot]

=== libtorsocks Warning ===
During running apt-get dist-upgrade, you may see a warning similar to the following one.

<pre>
15:36:37 libtorsocks(12225): sendmsg: Connection is a UDP or ICMP stream, may be a DNS request or other form of leak: rejecting.
Cannot talk to rtnetlink: No such file or directory
acpid: error talking to the kernel via netlink
</pre>

Sounds scary, but is of no concern. See footnote for technical explanation. <ref>
This is because in order to implement [[Stream Isolation]], Whonix's apt-get [https://github.com/Whonix/uwt uwt] wrapper forces apt-get through torsocks. Unfortunately, not only apt-get is forced through Tor, but also sysvinit and subsequently all daemons sysvinit is restarting. acpi_fakekey daemon uses local connections. Those will be rejected by torsocks. The worst that can happen is that acpi_fakekey won't operate until manually restarted. This is a bigger issue for web servers and alike, because those may not function until manually restarted.

This will likely be fixed as soon Whonix will be based on Debian jessie, because that uses systemd, that is not effected by this as well as torsocks 2.0 may solve this.
</ref>
<!--T:247-->

=== "apt-get source package" will show "dpkg-source: warning: failed to verify signature" ===
<!--T:109-->
This is not a security issue. It is only a warning. More info [http://lists.debian.org/debian-derivatives/2013/08/msg00000.html here] (and in the following mails).

If you want, you can get rid of it with the following workaround.

<!--T:110-->
1. Modify <code>/etc/dpkg/origins/default</code>.

<pre>
sudo unlink /etc/dpkg/origins/default
sudo ln -s /etc/dpkg/origins/debian /etc/dpkg/origins/default
</pre>

2. {{Code|apt-get source package}}

<!--T:250-->
3. Undo afterwards to prevent unexpected issues.

<pre>
sudo unlink /etc/dpkg/origins/default
sudo ln -s /etc/dpkg/origins/whonix /etc/dpkg/origins/default
</pre>

=== Proxychains Tor Browser Issue ===
Want to use proxychains for the connection scheme user -> Tor -> proxy? This currently won't work. For more information, see [[Tunnel_Proxy_or_SSH_or_VPN_through_Tor#Tor_Browser]].
