Whonix is an operating system with focus on anonymity, privacy and security, based on Tor anonymity network<ref>https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en</ref>, Debian GNU/Linux<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian</ref> [and Virtual Box<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VirtualBox</ref>]. By Whonix design, IP and DNS leaks are impossible. Not even malware with root rights can find out the user's real IP/location.

This is because Whonix consists of two [virtual] machines. One machine solely runs Tor and acts as a gateway, which we call Whonix-Gateway. The other machine, which we call Whonix-Workstation, is on a completely isolated network. Only connections through Tor are possible.

This is only a very brief introduction. See [[Documentation]] and/or [[Design|Technical Design]] for a more comprehensive description, security features and threat model. To find out how secure/anonymous Whonix is, see [[Technical_Introduction#Security_Overview|Security Overview]].

Whonix is produced independently from the TorÂ® anonymity software and carries no guarantee from The Tor Project about quality, suitability or anything else.
