<!--T:3-->
Whonix is an operating system focused on anonymity, privacy and security. It's based on the Tor anonymity network<ref>https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en</ref>, Debian GNU/Linux<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian</ref> and security by isolation. DNS leaks are impossible, and not even malware with root privileges can find out the user's real IP. 

<!--T:4-->
Whonix consists of two parts: One solely runs Tor and acts as a gateway, which we call Whonix-Gateway. The other, which we call Whonix-Workstation, is on a completely isolated network. Only connections through Tor are possible.

<!--T:5-->
To learn more about security and anonymity under Whonix, please continue to the [[About|About Whonix]] page.
