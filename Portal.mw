Whonix is an operating system focused on anonymity, privacy and security, based on the Tor anonymity network<ref>https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en</ref>, Debian GNU/Linux<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian</ref> and Virtual Box<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VirtualBox</ref><ref name=physicalisolation>You can use Whonix either using Virtual Machines or using hardware and Virtual Machines, which is more secure. See [[Physical Isolation]].</ref>. By design, IP and DNS leaks are impossible. Not even malware with root privileges can find out the user's real IP/location.

This is because Whonix consists of two virtual<ref name=physicalisolation /> machines. One machine solely runs Tor and acts as a gateway, which we call Whonix-Gateway. The other machine, which we call Whonix-Workstation, is on a completely isolated network. Only connections through Tor are possible.

To learn more about security and anonymity under Whonix, please continue to [[About|About Whonix]].
