= Logging in to captive portals =
== When Using VMs ==
Many publicly accessible Internet connections (usually available through a wireless network connection) require its users to register and login in order to get access to the Internet. This include both free and paid for services that may be found at Internet cafes, libraries, airports, hotels, universities etc. Normally in these situations, a so called ''captive portal'' intercepts any website request made and redirects the web browser to a login page. None of that works inside {{workstation_product_name}}, so a browser with unrestricted network access is necessary. The browser on the host operating system must be used for this purpose. Note that this means that '''the browser on the host is NOT anonymous''', so use it carefully.

== When Using Physical Isolation ==
There is no unsafe browser on {{gateway_product_name}} installed by default. You could use a third machine, which has access to clearnet or boot the hardware which runs {{gateway_product_name}} with another operating system (from USB), which is not torified.

== Security recommendations ==
* While this browser can be used unrestrictively for anything, it is ''highly'' recommended to only use it for the purpose stated above, i.e. to access and login on captive portals.
* Do not run this browser at the same time as the normal, anonymous web browser. This makes it easy to not mistake one browser for the other, which could have catastrophic consequences for your anonymity.
* Run this browser from a dedicated VM and lock it down with NoScript and isolation programs like FireJail (Linux only).

== Unsafe Browser Installation ==
=== Installation ===
Discouraged!

This has to be done while you already/still have an internet connection. It cannot be done on the go when you need an internet connection since no unsafe browser is installed by default.

The following instructions are to be applied on {{gateway_product_name}}.

Configure user home of user <code>clearnet</code> to <code>/home/clearnet</code> as it is not set by Whonix default.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo usermod -m -d /home/clearnet clearnet
}}

Create folder <code>/home/clearnet</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo mkdir -p /home/clearnet
}}

Set owner of folder <code>/home/clearnet</code> to be user <code>clearnet</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo chown -R clearnet:clearnet /home/clearnet
}}

Install a browser.

{{Install_Package|
package=firefox-esr
}}

=== Usage ===
Start <code>bash</code> as user <code>clearnet</code>. <ref>
The <code>sudo</code> <code>--set-home</code> parameter is important to prevent file permission issues since a GUI application is to be started under a different user account. Similar to [[Install_Software#GUI_Applications_with_Root_Rights|GUI Applications with Root Rights]].

Quote <code>sudo</code> man page:

<blockquote>
-H, --set-home<br />
    Request that the security policy set the HOME environment variable to the home directory specified by the target user's password database entry. Depending on the policy, this may be the default behavior.
</blockquote>
</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo --set-home -u clearnet bash
}}

Change directory into user <code>clearnet</code> home folder.

{{CodeSelect|code=
cd ~ 
}}

Start a browser.

{{CodeSelect|code=
firefox
}}
