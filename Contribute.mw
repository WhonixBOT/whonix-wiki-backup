=== KDE Desktop Developer ===

If you know KDE desktop scripting, for example how to change the Desktop {{Code|folder view}} using a script and would volunteer to answer such questions that would be immensely helpful.

=== Audit Documentation Changes ===

Keep up to date on our [[Special:RecentChanges|wiki changes]]. ([https://www.whonix.org/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=rss rss] [[File:2000px-Feed-icon.svg.png|12px|alt=Whonix wiki recent changes rss|link=https://www.whonix.org/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=rss]])

=== Audit Whonix ===

Audit Whonix's security.

A good place is starting with the source code and running

<pre>
grep -r "REVIEW" *
</pre>

for places where I could need more input. Also reviewing the whole source code or just the major configuration files would be fine. Or review the [[Design]].


=== Backup Whonix ===
Run [[WhonixBackupScript]].
