=== Testing ===
{{project_name}} needs more people to test new {{project name}} features, bug fixes and so on.

* Perform [[Test|numerous activity tests]] on both {{workstation_product_name}} and {{gateway_product_name}}, while running a separate, testers-only {{project name}} version based on the [[{{project name short}}-APT-Repository#{{project_name}}_APT_Repository_Overview|stable-proposed-updates APT repository]].

=== Run the {{project name}} Backup Script ===

Create a backup of the {{project name}} Anonymous Operating System website and source code. The more people that retain backups, the less likely {{project name}} can be erased from the history books. This can be done periodically, every now and then or when convenient.

See: [[{{project name short}}BackupScript|How to Backup {{project_name}}]] for further details.

Donate them to {{project name}} or release them into the [https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ public domain]. We also have a video script waiting to be produced - please get in contact for further details.

=== Social Media / Marketing ===
Although social media platforms erode privacy goals by collecting a lot of user data, we believe they are important venues for marketing and communication in the modern era.

==== Maintainer List ====
{{Maintainer List}}

{{Anchor|Maintainer}}

==== Maintainer Responsibilities ====
The tasks of a contributor include:

* Answering questions in the forums.
* Keeping the wiki up-to-date.
* Testing of installation, build and upgrade instructions.
* Following the issue tracker, squashing bugs and perhaps implementing new features relating to the maintained component.
* Otherwise self-initiated (guess)work and taking care of the [[#Contributor List|component]] in question.

This is a volunteer position.

==== Package Maintainer ====
{{project_name}} provides a lot of Debian packages; see [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}} Overview] for further information. Due to limited [[Contributors|{{project_name}} contributors]] resources, only [[{{project_name_short}}_Packages_for_Debian_Hosts|a few]] packages are supported on Debian hosts. A lot of these packages are [[Other_Operating_Systems#{{project_name}}_Packages|untested and unmaintained]] in any other Linux distribution.

Would you be interested in maintaining one or more packages for use beyond {{project_name}}? For example, in Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora or other distributions? Maintenance requirements would involve keeping up with code changes and releases, testing if these packages work outside of {{project_name}}, eventually reporting bugs or adding new features, and answering user support requests. 

If interested, ambitious package contributors could even seek to have one or more {{project name}} packages accepted into a mainstream Linux distribution.

This is a volunteer position.

==== General Tasks ====
People with skills and interest in the following areas would also help:

* Good knowledge of Linux networking and iptables.
* AppArmor profile creation and testing of new [[AppArmor]] profiles for improved security.
* {{Code2|#!/bin/bash}}
* Programming languages like Python, Ruby, C, and others.
* Registration at our new issue tracker [https://phabricator.whonix.org/maniphest/query/open/ https://phabricator.whonix.org]; consider [[Dev/Issue_Tracker#Get_E-Mail_Notification_for_all_New_Maniphest_Tasks|subscribing]].
* Participation in the [https://forums.whonix.org/c/development development forum]; consider hitting the "notify" button to subscribe.
* Discussion participation - login on github and go to https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/{{project_name_short}}/issues and press "watch" for notifications about {{project name}} github issues (this is an old issue tracker and less important).

=== Release Manager ===
If you are willing to have your real name connected to the {{project name}} project and Tor, please continue reading.

Depending on your interests, your tasks could include:

* Building {{project name}} .ova images:
** Creating stable releases.
** Creating stable hotfix releases.
** Creating assorted other builds. <ref>
** Creating terminal-only {{gateway_product_name}}.
** Creating testers-only releases.
** Creating {{project_name}}-Gnome-Workstation.
** Creating {{project_name}}-LXDE-Workstation.
** Creating 64-bit builds.
</ref>
* Building {{project name}} .libvirt images.
* Reporting bugs when builds fail.
* Signing and uploading releases.
* Updating the download page.
* Posting to the blog or mailing lists.
* Fixing simple build documentation.
* [[Dev/Redistribution]]
* [[Test]]ing. <ref>This will be easy and fast as soon as we add a script.</ref>

This is a volunteer position.
