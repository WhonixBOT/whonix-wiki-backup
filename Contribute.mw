We need more Whonix [[Videos]]. Maybe in your language? No matter if demonstration videos, promotional videos, conceptual videos or tutorials. Donate them to Whonix or release them into [https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ public domain]. We also have a video script waiting to be produced, get in contact.

=== Social Media / Marketing ===

=== Development ===
----
</center>
==== Maintainer ====
Whonix provides a lot Debian packages. ([https://github.com/Whonix Overview]) Usage of these packages is currently [[Other_Operating_Systems#Whonix_Packages|untested and unmaintained]] in any Linux distributions besides Whonix due to limited recourses of the [[Authorship|Whonix team]].

Would you be interested to maintain one or another package for using them outside of Whonix? Such as in Debian or so? Maintenance means here, keep up with code changes and releases, test if these packages work outside of Whonix, eventually report bugs or add new features, answer support requests by users.

Or would you be even interested to get one or another package into mainstream Linux distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora or so?

==== General ====
Any of these would help...

* Have good knowledge of Linux networking and iptables?
* AppArmor: Know how to create AppArmor profiles? Join us testing new [[AppArmor]] profiles for improved security!
* {{Code2|#!/bin/bash}}
* python
* ruby
* C
* etc.
* Login on github, go to https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues and press "watch" to get notified about discussions on Whonix github issues.
* [https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/board,5.0.html development forum]

=== Translations Coordinator ===
* [https://www.whonix.org/blog/translations-coordinator Translations Coordinator]

=== Release Manager ===
If you have no problem having your real name connected to the Whonix project and Tor, please continue reading.

Your task could include, depending on your interest:

* building Whonix .ova images
** creating terminal-only Whonix-Gateway
** creating testers-only releases
** creating Whonix-Gnome-Workstation
** creating Whonix-LXDE-Workstation
** creating stable releases
** creating stable hotfix releases
** creating 64 bit builds
** you name it


* report bug when build fails
* signing them
* uploading them
* updating the download page
* blog/mailing-lists posting
* fixing build documentation, if it's simple or reporting a bug
* [[Dev/Redistribution]]
* [[Test]]ing (will be easy and fast as soon we add a script)

=== KDE Desktop Developer ===

If you know KDE desktop scripting, for example how to change the Desktop {{Code|folder view}} using a script and would volunteer to answer such questions that would be immensely helpful.

=== Audit Documentation Changes ===

Keep up to date on our [[Special:RecentChanges|wiki changes]]. ([https://www.whonix.org/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=rss rss] [[File:Feed-icon.jpeg|12px|alt=Whonix wiki recent changes rss|link=https://www.whonix.org/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=rss]])

=== Audit Whonix ===

Audit Whonix's security.

A good place is starting with the source code and running

<pre>
grep -r "REVIEW" *
</pre>

for places where we could need more input. Also reviewing the whole source code or just the major configuration files would be fine. Or review the [[Design]].

=== Backup Whonix ===
Run [[WhonixBackupScript]].

=== Download Mirror ===
[[Hosting a Whonix Mirror]]


=== Testing ===
Whonix needs more people to test new Whonix features, bug fixes and so on.
