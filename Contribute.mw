If you appreciate adrelanos's work on Whonix, want to say thanks and support further maintenance, support, development and hosting, please donate. It will keep adrelanos motivated. It is no secret, that the money could be spend on amusements as a tiny compensation for the countless hours of research and development.

Adrelanos would like to buy better and more hardware for testing. This would speed up development and improve quality assurance.

If you want to pay for getting a new feature, this may be possible as well, please get in [[Contact#For_private_inquiries|Contact]] to talk about the details.

If you don't have any Bitcoins and want to donate non-anonymously, you could use a Web Wallet service such as [https://coinbase.com/ Coinbase]. While Coinbase requires a US bank account, there are other exchanges, which allow to easily pay by bank wire and to forward the money to the Bitcoin address of your choice. Please get in [[Contact#For_Donations|Contact]] if you would like to donate but don't know how.

= Testing =

Whonix needs more people to test new Whonix features, bug fixes and so on.

= Forum Moderator =

Please apply as a Forum Moderator. You can help by approving posts by real people and stopping automatic spam bots. And perhaps answer a question if you know the answer, or just leave the question unanswered until adrelanos or someone else answers.

If you want, you get notified about new posts by e-mail. If you could check and moderate the forums a few times every day in your spare time, that would really help.

= Screenshots =

Make awesome Whonix [[Screenshots]]. Donate them to Whonix or release them into [https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ public domain].

= Videos =

We need more Whonix [[Videos]]. Maybe in your language? No matter if demonstration videos, promotional videos, conceptual videos or tutorials. Donate them to Whonix or release them into [https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ public domain].

= Social Media / Marketing =

I am not very experienced in maintaining social media representations. Even though they work against privacy goals by collecting a lot data, I believe they are important for marketing and communication nowadays.

If you are willing to help or to maintain Whonix's Twitter account, Facebook page, Google+, YouTube or identic.ca account, please get in contact.

Building Whonix from source is very easy and you get assistance.

* it doesn't involve coding

Your task could include:

* building Whonix .ova images
** creating testers-only releases
** creating stable releases
** creating stable hotfix or point releases
** creating 64 bit builds


* report bug when build fails
* signing them
* uploading them
* updating the download page
* blog/mailing-lists posting
* fixing build documentation, if its simple or reporting a bug
* [[Dev/BuildDocumentation_6_short]], [[Dev/BuildDocumentation_6]]
* [[Dev/Redistribution]] (that page needs an update, not pointing to github and clarifications, separating different roles)
* [[Test]]ing (will be easy and fast as soon we add a script)


Don't worry. It's not difficult. You get an initial training and can always ask questions. If you're interested, please get in [[Contact]].

= Spokesperson =

Whonix developer adrelanos currently prefers to stay anonymous for reasons listed on the [[Trust]] page.

Truly anonymous development prevents various things:

* Buying cheap and reliable servers. (Virtual Private Server For a better, multilingual website.)
* Buying a cheap domain.
* More trustworthy binary builds.
* Videos with human speech.
* Voice, video or real interviews.
* Attending conferences.

If you have no problem having your real name connected to the Whonix project and Tor, please apply.

= Lawyer =

Either answering some small questions or filling one piece of paperwork would be immensely helpful.

= Development =

[[Image:Whonix-ad.png|frame|none|alt=| Looking for developers!]]

Whonix is as [[FAQ#How_difficult_is_it_to_develop_Whonix.3F | easy]] as shell scripting (bash). We need developers! Join Whonix Development Mailing List!

= KDE Desktop Developer =

If you know KDE desktop scripting, for example how to change Desktop view to folder view using a script and would volunteer to answer such questions that would be immensely helpful.

= Audit =

Audit Whonix's security.

A good place is starting with the source code and running

<pre>
grep -r "REVIEW" *
</pre>

for places where I could need more input. Also reviewing the whole source code or just the major configuration files would be fine. Or review the [[Design]].
