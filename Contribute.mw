= Testing =
Whonix needs more people to test new Whonix features, bug fixes and so on.

Run [[WhonixBackupScript]].

= Download Mirror =
[[Hosting a Whonix Mirror]]

= Forum Moderator =

Please apply as a Forum Moderator. You can help by approving posts by real people and stopping automatic spam bots. And perhaps answer a question if you know the answer, or just leave the question unanswered until Patrick Schleizer or someone else answers.

If you want, you get notified about new posts by e-mail. If you could check and moderate the forums a few times every day in your spare time, that would really help.

= Screenshots =

Make awesome Whonix [[Screenshots]]. Donate them to Whonix or release them into [https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ public domain].

= Videos =

We need more Whonix [[Videos]]. Maybe in your language? No matter if demonstration videos, promotional videos, conceptual videos or tutorials. Donate them to Whonix or release them into [https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ public domain].

= Social Media / Marketing =

I am not very experienced in maintaining social media representations. Even though they work against privacy goals by collecting a lot data, I believe they are important for marketing and communication nowadays.

If you are willing to help or to maintain Whonix's Twitter account, Facebook page, Google+, YouTube or identic.ca account, please get in contact.

= Release Manager =
'''Much needed!'''

Don't worry. It's not difficult. You get an initial training and can always ask questions. If you're interested, please get in [[Contact]].

If you have no problem having your real name connected to the Whonix project and Tor, please continue reading.

Building Whonix from source is easy and you get assistance.

* it doesn't involve coding

Your task could include, depending on your interest:

* building Whonix .ova images
** creating terminal-only Whonix-Gateway
** creating testers-only releases
** creating Whonix-Gnome-Workstation
** creating Whonix-LXDE-Workstation
** creating stable releases
** creating stable hotfix releases
** creating 64 bit builds
** you name it


* report bug when build fails
* signing them
* uploading them
* updating the download page
* blog/mailing-lists posting
* fixing build documentation, if its simple or reporting a bug
* [[Dev/Redistribution]]
* [[Test]]ing (will be easy and fast as soon we add a script)

= Lawyer =

Either answering some small questions or filling one piece of paperwork would be immensely helpful.

= Development =
[[Image:Whonix-ad.png|frame|none|alt=| Looking for developers!]]

Whonix is as [[FAQ#How_difficult_is_it_to_develop_Whonix.3F|easy]] as shell scripting (bash). We need developers!

Join [[Mailing_Lists#whonix-devel|Whonix Development Mailing List]]!

Login on github, go to https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues and press "watch" to get notified about discussions on Whonix github issues.

= KDE Desktop Developer =

If you know KDE desktop scripting, for example how to change Desktop view to folder view using a script and would volunteer to answer such questions that would be immensely helpful.

= Audit =

Audit Whonix's security.

A good place is starting with the source code and running

<pre>
grep -r "REVIEW" *
</pre>

for places where I could need more input. Also reviewing the whole source code or just the major configuration files would be fine. Or review the [[Design]].
