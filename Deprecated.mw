= Updating Tor =

Tor was installed on Whonix according to [https://www.torproject.org/docs/debian#ubuntu official instructions for Ubuntu]. You can update Tor (and the rest of the system) using ''apt-get update'' and ''apt-get dist-upgrade''.

If you run in the following error message when running ''apt-get update'' on the Gateway...

<pre>W: GPG error: http://deb.torproject.org precise Inrelease: The following signature were invalid: Keyexpired 1346668560</pre>

...or into the following error message on the Gateway when running ''apt-get dist-upgrade'':

<pre>Warning: The following packages cannot be authenticated!
deb.torproject.org-keyring tor
Install these packages without varification?</pre>

...please use the workaround below. Please do not install without verification for your own safety!

Temporary fix. Run these two commands. (Check if they are still current and genuine in official instructions for Ubuntu.)

<pre>gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv 886DDD89

gpg --export A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89 | sudo apt-key add -</pre>

(If they fail for the first time, perhaps because you are on a slow network or slow Tor circuit, run them a few times until the succeed.)

,, Technical problem: The latest Whonix release is a few days ago and in meanwhile there is a new deb.torproject.org-keyring got renewed while the old torproject deb keys expired. Fixing the problem requires a new Whonix release. It will be fixed in 0.3.0.

= VirtualBox Guest Additions =

== Introduction ==

Written and tested with Whonix 0.2.1 (Ubuntu precise). Many things can go wrong and none or the very least of them will be caused by Whonix. This has only limited support by the Whonix developers, because 1. it's not recommended for security reasons and 2. the guest additions related bugs and instructions are somewhat out of the scope of the Whonix project.

Installation is somewhat difficult and no packages exist. Just search the internet and you'll see, that loads of people having issues installing the VirtualBox guest additions. People having problems for years. VMware is of no alternative, people are also having trouble installing the VMware tools into Linux guests. The issue with the guest additions is ridiculous. For years no solution has been found. With each kernel update, recompilation is required, and quite often, due to some updates, complication becomes difficult or impossible for a long time.

Also see article, [[http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page#news_item&px#OTk5Mw|The VirtualBox Kernel Driver Is Tainted Crap]].

If you are having trouble, than in most cases not because of Whonix. The Whonix setup is a regular Ubuntu Linux and VirtualBox. You can try asking the regular VirtualBox and Ubuntu resources if you have trouble.

= TorChat source package =

== HowTo ==

'''EXPERIMENTAL''' Experimental as in it is difficult to install. Only use it in case you trust TorChat. There shouldn't be any anonymity leaks and it should be as safe as other hidden services in general and in Whonix.

Learn about [[Hidden Services]] in Whonix first and learn how to set up the hidden webserver. This will ease following this guide.

On Whonix-Gateway.

Open your {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}.

<pre>sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc</pre>

Add.

<pre>HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/torchat_service/
HiddenServicePort 11009 192.168.0.11:11009</pre>

Save. Reload Tor.

<pre>sudo service tor reload</pre>

On Whonix-Gateway.

Install dependencies.

<pre>sudo apt-get install python python-wxgtk2.8</pre>

Get your onion address.

<pre>nano /var/lib/tor/torchat_service/hostname</pre>

Backup your key, if you want to ever restore it one another machine, a newer Whonix-Workstation or after hdd failure.

<pre>/var/lib/tor/torchat_service/private_key</pre>

Download the latest Python version of TorChat source code, for example as time of writing torchat-source-0.9.9.553.zip - Python source code (classic standalone 0.9.9 version) from (https://github.com/prof7bit/TorChat/downloads) and store it in ''/home/user''.

Unpack.

<pre>unzip torchat-source-0.9.9.553.zip</pre>

Get into the torchat source folder. For example.

<pre>cd /home/user/torchat-source-0.9.9.553/</pre>

Get into the src folder.

<pre>cd src</pre>

Get into the Tor folder.

<pre>cd Tor</pre>

Rename tor.sh.

<pre>mv tor.sh backup_tor.sh</pre>

Go back to the src folder.

<pre>cd ..</pre>

Create torchat.ini.

<pre>nano torchat.ini</pre>

Add the following content.

<pre>[client]
listen_interface = 192.168.0.11
listen_port = 11009
own_hostname = <your onion hostname without .onion>

[tor]
tor_server = 192.168.0.10
tor_server_control_port = 9154
tor_server_socks_port = 9154

[tor_portable]
tor_server = 192.168.0.10
tor_server_control_port = 9154
tor_server_socks_port = 9154</pre>

Make torchat executable.

<pre>chmod +x torchat.py</pre>

Run torchat.

<pre>./torchat</pre>

=== Alternative ===

After installing the dependencies we could also force install the torchat deb package.

<pre>sudo dpkg -i --force-depends torchat-0.9.9.553.deb</pre>

And then configure the files inside ''/home/user/.torchat''. I don't know if that may be the better way.

= Mixmaster =

== MX capable DNS resolver ==

No longer required.

Mixmaster needs to resolve MX DNS records, [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7829 while Tor does not support that]. We have to install a DNS resolver capable of doing that. It still comes with caveats.

Required knowledge:

* Introduction chapter of [[Secondary DNS Resolver]]

The [[Secondary DNS Resolver#example-with-cznic-labs-dns-resolver|Example with CZ.NIC Labs DNS resolver]] worked in this case.

Security considerations when replacing the system wide DNS resolver:

<ul>
<li>The third party DNS resolver traffic goes through its own circuit, which is good.</li>
<li><p>All (custom installed) applications not configured to use a SocksPort (see [Stream Isolation]), would resolve their DNS through the system wide DNS resolver, which would be the third party resolver, giving too much power to it, because it's always the same, only one service provider, not changing like Tor circuits but static. ## Install Postfix ##</p>
<p>sudo apt-get install postfix ## configure postfix as sattelite system, default settings</p></li></ul>

Technical background: Mixmaster requires either - a) An (open) smtp server SMTPRELAY in ''/etc/mixmaster/remailer.conf''. Unfortunately, I haven't found any open smtp server (search term: open relay). A mailserver where the user registers first would probably work, but this would defeat the original idea: sending e-mails without depending on registration. Or, - b) a mta (mail transfer agent), which speaks to the remailer directly. '''TODO''': Are there enough Tor exit relays, which allow the SMTP port and does their ISP allow to speak SMTP? If there are too few servers, it could be bad for anonymity.

Open ''/etc/postfix/main.cf''.

<pre>kdesudo kwrite /etc/postfix/main.cf</pre>

Replace the content with the following.

<pre># See /usr/share/postfix/main.cf.dist for a commented, more complete version


# Debian specific:  Specifying a file name will cause the first
# line of that file to be used as the name.  The Debian default
# is /etc/mailname.
#myorigin = /etc/mailname

smtpd_banner = $myhostname ESMTP $mail_name (Debian/GNU)
biff = no

# appending .domain is the MUA's job.
append_dot_mydomain = no

# Uncomment the next line to generate "delayed mail" warnings
#delay_warning_time = 4h

readme_directory = no

# TLS parameters
smtpd_tls_cert_file=/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
smtpd_tls_key_file=/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key
smtpd_use_tls=yes
smtpd_tls_session_cache_database = btree:${data_directory}/smtpd_scache
smtp_tls_session_cache_database = btree:${data_directory}/smtp_scache

# See /usr/share/doc/postfix/TLS_README.gz in the postfix-doc package for
# information on enabling SSL in the smtp client.

myhostname = host.localdomain
alias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases
alias_database = hash:/etc/aliases
mydestination = host, host.localdomain, localhost.localdomain, localhost
mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 [::ffff:127.0.0.0]/104 [::1]/128
mailbox_command = 
mailbox_size_limit = 0
recipient_delimiter = +
inet_interfaces = loopback-only
inet_protocols = all

relayhost = 1.1.1.1
#relayhost = 2.2.2.2</pre>

== Debugging Postfix ==

Looking into the mail log.

<pre>tail -f /var/log/mail.info</pre>

Should contain something like this.

<pre>
<date> <time> debian postfix/pickup[id]: id2: uid=1000 from=<user>
<date> <time> debian postfix/cleanup[id]: id2: message-id=<id3.id4@host.localdomain>
<date> <time> debian postfix/qmgr[id]: id2: from=<user@host.localdomain>, size=30000, nrcpt=1 (queue active)
<date> <time> debian postfix/smtp[300]: id2: to=<remailer@breaka.net>, relay=mail.breaka.net[202.75.54.8]:25, delay=30, delays=0.30/0.01/30/3.0, dsn=2.0.0, status=sent (250 OK id=id5-id6-id7)
<date> <time> debian postfix/qmgr[id]: id2: removed
</pre>

Reading local mail.

<pre>## Either with cli tool mail.
mail

## Or using gui tool Icedove (Debian version of Mozilla Thunderbird)
## using movemail.</pre>

If all went well, there will be no local mail. Only error messages result in local mails.

= Bugs =

* In Whonix 0.4.5, due to a [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7668 Tor Browser upstream bug] (they forgot to update the changelog) and because the keyserver is/was down, the torbrowser and whonixcheck script in Whonix can no longer find out which Tor Browser version is locally installed. ([https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/6122990d/ Whonix Bug Report]) The [[TorBrowser#update-tor-browser|Update Tor Browser]] chapter contains a workaround and a fix is available for testers.

= E-Mail Notification =

Users, who have an (anonymous) sourceforge.net account, could go to the [https://sourceforge.net/projects/whonix/ Whonix sf.net Project Page], scroll down to ''Update Notifications'' and hit the ''Subscribe to Updates'' button. They would receive notifications about new releases sent to their (anonymous) [E-Mail] address.

There is currently no way for users to subscribe to sf.net blogs or wiki, but such a feature [https://sourceforge.net/p/allura/tickets/5702/ has been requested].

== Sourceforge.net E-Mail Notification ==

Didn't work reliable.

E-mail notification: For users having an account on sf.net, there is on [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/code/ sf.net] git is an [[E-Mail]] subscribe button: '''M'''.

This is an example how such a mail could look like:

= Restrict Flash Settings =
'''You can skip this chapter. It's no longer of use, because if you use BetterPrivacy as recommended above, you won't need this.'''

Flash applications can set cookies, so-called Local Shared Objects (LSO), independently of the browser's settings. These cookies are able to save data up to 100 Kb. Usually, they save settings but they may be used to track surfers as well.

In order to manage the settings of your Adobe Flash Player, Macromedia offers a [http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html Flash application] on its website. There you may e.g. configure the rules concerning the data storage and the rights for using camera and microphone. The settings are spread over several flash applications. Deactivate all functions that allow sharing and saving of data. The storage of LSOs may be deactivated on the [http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html Global Storage Settings panel].

Hint: Only in case you previously deactivated JavaScript: You must have Javascript enabled for adobe.com and macromedia.com temporary to run the Flash application. 

[[Image:flash1.png|none]]

Furthermore, the cookies already saved have to be deleted. This functionality may be found on the [http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html Website Storage Settings panel].

[[Image:flash2.png|none]]

Personal side note: you see how ridiculous that plugin is, if the usage of the Flash settings manager depends on their website being reachable.

= Build Documentation dpkg-source commit =
To dpkg commit changes, run the debian upstream tarball creation script.

<pre>
./help-steps/make-debian-package-upstream-tarball
</pre>

Then run.

<pre>
dpkg-source --commit
</pre>

When it asks "Enter the desired patch name:" just enter anything you wish, for example "buildconfig". In the following window, you don't have to fill out anything. Just save and close the editor. <ref>This will create a Debian quilt patch.</ref> You only have to do this once and won't be asked again to do this, unless you add another change which needs to be dpkg-source committed.

If you want to undo the dpkg-source committed change, check the contents of the {{Code|.pc}} and the {{Code|debian/patches}} folder and delete it.
= Build Documentation - Override Whonix Version =
Since the Whonix debian package version number is auto derived from {{Code|git describe}} and used for [[Download#Whonix_Version_Check_and_Whonix_News|Whonix News]] download, it is recommended to override it. <ref>Alternatively, you could deactivate or override [[Download#Whonix_Version_Check_and_Whonix_News|Whonix News]] in the whonixcheck script and manually stay on top of news.</ref> You could add a file to {{Code|buildconfig.d}}, for example {{Code|buildconfig.d/50_version}} and add for example.

<pre>
temp="$WHONIX_BUILD_CLOSEST_GIT_TAG"

## Using `export`, so whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/chroot-scripts-post.d/70_log_build_version can read it.
export WHONIX_BUILD_WHONIX_VERSION_NEW="$(echo "$temp" | sed 's/-/./g')"

echo "WHONIX_BUILD_WHONIX_VERSION_NEW: $WHONIX_BUILD_WHONIX_VERSION_NEW"

WHONIX_BUILD_NEW_CHANGELOG_VERSION=""$WHONIX_BUILD_WHONIX_VERSION_NEW""-debpackage""$WHONIX_BUILD_NEW_DEB_REVISION_VERSION""

echo "WHONIX_BUILD_NEW_CHANGELOG_VERSION: $WHONIX_BUILD_NEW_CHANGELOG_VERSION"
</pre>

While building, check if WHONIX_BUILD_NEW_CHANGELOG_VERSION looks sane. <ref>For example {{Code|WHONIX_BUILD_NEW_CHANGELOG_VERSION: 2:6.13.g4218c564e556cb68a3f18dc4040db5353690706c}} does not look sane, but {{Code|WHONIX_BUILD_NEW_CHANGELOG_VERSION: 2:6-debpackage1}} looks sane.</ref>

If you added a new file to {{Code|buildconfig.d}}, for example {{Code|buildconfig.d/50_target_arch}}, those have to be dpkg-source committed before building Whonix. Otherwise you'll get an error message. (Which looks like this:<ref name=dpkgcommit>
<pre>

= Manually updating Tor Browser (Whonix 0.5.6) =
{{Old-Stable-0.5.6}}

(1) Go to https://www.torproject.org/ and/or http://idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion/ and download the Tor Browser Bundle for Linux 32 bit. Store it in ''/home/user/''.

(2) Read https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en and/or http://idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en and learn about gpg verification.

(3) Go to https://www.torproject.org/docs/signing-keys.html.en and/or http://idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion/docs/signing-keys.html.en to get the gpg keys.

(4) Verify the Tor Browser Bundle download.

(5) Go into ''/home/user/'' with the file manger. (Dolphin)

(6) Extract the Tor Browser Bundle. Right click on the downloaded archive -> extract -> extract archive here.

(7) In case you downloaded another version than ''en-US'', rename the tor-browser_''lang'' folder to ''tor-browser_en-US''. This is important, because the paths in the following script are hardcoded.

(8) Go into the ''/home/user/tor-browser_en-US'' folder.

(9) Delete ''start-tor-browser'' or move it to the ''/home/user/tor-browser_en-US/Docs'' folder.

(10) Create a new file within the ''/home/user/tor-browser_en-US/'' folder called ''start-tor-browser'' with the following content.

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
## Whonix Tor Browser start script

export TOR_SKIP_LAUNCH=1
    
cd ~
~/tor-browser_en-US/App/Firefox/firefox --profile ~/tor-browser_en-US/Data/profile
    
## End of Whonix Tor Browser start script
</pre>

(11) Make the ''start-tor-browser'' script executable. Right click on ''start-tor-browser'' -> Properties -> Permissions -> enable the ''Is executable'' box -> ok.

(12) Go to ''/home/user/tor-browser_en-US/Data/profile/'' and create a file ''user.js'' with the following content.

<pre>## Begin of patched user.js.

## If you edit this file while Firefox is running, your changes will be
## overwritten, when you close Firefox.

## How to create the user.js network settings:
## 1. Make a backup of prefs.js.
## 1. Start Tor Browser with the patched start script.
## 2. Apply proxy settings using the Tor Button settings dialog..
## 3. Make a diff from the old and the new pref.js.
## 4. Copy the relevant changes to user.js.

## network settings
## (Are now set in /etc/environment - or not...)
## (See /etc/environment.)
user_pref("extensions.torbutton.use_privoxy", false);
user_pref("extensions.torbutton.settings_method", "custom");

user_pref("extensions.torbutton.custom.socks_host", "192.168.0.10");
user_pref("extensions.torbutton.custom.socks_port", 9100);

## End of Whonix user.js.
</pre>

(13) If you want to make 100% sure you never have Tor over Tor, you must shut down Whonix-Gateway while doing the following.

(14) Delete /home/user/my_tor-browser_en-US/App/tor.

(15) If there is '''no''' green Vidalia icon in the task bar, everything is fine.

(16) Start Tor Browser and run

<pre>ps aux | grep tor</pre>

If you see something like.

<pre>109 /usr/sbin/tor</pre>

Or.

<pre>/home/user/my_tor-browser_en-US/App/tor</pre>

Something went wrong and you're running Tor over Tor, which is recommended against.

(17) If the tests results are as expected, everything went fine.

(18) Don't forget to restart Whonix-Gateway, if you shut it down in step (13).

(19) Done.

= DummyTor =
== Introduction ==
{{Old-Stable-0.5.6}}

Whonix-Workstation has an empty Tor package installed by default, called Dummy Tor package. It contains no files, besides some default files<ref>changelog.gz copyright README.Debian control control.tar.gz data.tar.gz debian-binary md5sums</ref>, which are required to create a dummy package. Debian packages are standard Unix '''ar''' archives, auditors can unpack and check them.

The reason for installing the Dummy Tor package inside Whonix-Workstation is to prevent installing the Tor package from the upstream (Debian or The Tor Project) repository, to prevent running Tor over Tor. This allows installation of packages, which depend on Tor, such as [[Chat#TorChat|TorChat]] and parcimonie on Whonix-Workstation.

To prevent the package from upgrading

<pre>echo "tor hold" | sudo dpkg --set-selections</pre>

has been run while building Whonix from source code.

To check the status an auditor could run.

<pre>dpkg --get-selections | grep tor</pre>

To undo holding the packing a user could run.

<pre>echo "tor install" | sudo dpkg --set-selections</pre>

== Implementation ==
{{Old-Stable-0.5.6}}

* Everything is inside the ''whonix_workstation/usr/local/share/whonix/dummytor/'' folder in Whonix source code
* and subsequently in /usr/local/share/whonix/dummytor/ in Whoix-Workstation.
* .deb package format
* /usr/local/share/whonix/dummytor/tor is the control file
* /usr/local/share/whonix/dummytor/tor_1.0_all.deb is the package which was installed using dpkg by whonix_workstation/usr/local/share/whonix_internal_install_script.
* whonix_workstation/usr/local/share/whonix/dummytor/dummytor is the "build script" for the package, which is actually only a single "equivs-build ./tor" command.

== Remove Proxy Settings - Whonix 0.5.6 ==
{{Old-Stable-0.5.6}}

It's best to get a fresh copy of Tor Browser, which has never been started before.

Whonix modifies user.js as documented in the [[Tor_Browser#Whonix_Proxy_Settings_.2F_user.js|Tor Browser chapter]].

Open ''/home/user/tor-browser_en-US_my/Data/profile/user.js''.

<pre>kwrite /home/user/tor-browser_en-US_my/Data/profile/user.js</pre>

Comment out all network settings.<ref>These steps are required to remove proxy settings.</ref> <ref>TOR_SOCKS_HOST and TOR_SOCKS_PORT were set for [[Stream Isolation]].</ref>

<pre>
## network settings
#user_pref("extensions.torbutton.use_privoxy", false);
#user_pref("extensions.torbutton.settings_method", "custom");
#user_pref("extensions.torbutton.socks_host", "192.168.0.10");
#user_pref("extensions.torbutton.socks_port", 9100);
#user_pref("network.proxy.socks", "192.168.0.10");
#user_pref("network.proxy.socks_port", 9100);
#user_pref("extensions.torbutton.custom.socks_host", "192.168.0.10");
#user_pref("extensions.torbutton.custom.socks_port", 9100);
</pre>

You could use Tor Button's settings dialog to set it to any other proxy or transparent torification. The latter means "no proxy", which will result in Tor Browser using whatever the operating system provides and if you don't have a VPN installed inside Whonix-Workstation, it will go through Tor's TransPort.

If you are using the transparent torification option in Tor Button, you could point a socksifier to ''start-tor-browser'' and it should work as usual.

If you are having problems, it's most likely a problem with Tor Browser / Tor Button's proxy settings. In Tor Browser open the pseudo url "''about:config''" and search for "''network.proxy''" and check if these settings are sane.

= Tor Browser in Whonix 0.5.6 =

== Introduction ==

The regular Tor Browser Bundle and Tor Browser in Whonix slightly differ. Tor Browser has been slightly modified by Whonix to work behind the Whonix-Gateway. The network and browser fingerprint however, is the same.

Tor Browser's internal update check mechanism is untouched and works fine. Default homepage is untouched and still https://check.torproject.org.

== New Identity Button ==

Note that, if you are using the Tor Browser, which comes with Whonix, that the New Identity button of Tor Button is defunct (greyed out). This is because Tor Button can not access Tor's control port. Due to Whonix Technical [[Design]], Tor Browser and Tor are isolated from each other, which means there is no way to fix this without loosing the added security by Whonix.

When using the regular Tor Browser Bundle (not Whonix!), the New Identity button unlinks your old identity, changes your circuit (exit relay IP) and creates a fresh identity.

As a workaround close Tor Browser, change your circuit with [[Tor Controller|Arm]] and start Tor Browser again.

This isn't a big issue, since the New Identity button isn't perfect yet anyway, there are open bugs.<ref>See [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=needs_information&status=needs_review&status=new&status=reopened&order=priority&col=id&col=summary&col=keywords&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&keywords=tbb-linkability tbb-linkability] and [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=needs_review&status=needs_revision&status=new&status=reopened&order=priority&col=id&col=summary&col=keywords&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&keywords=tbb-fingerprinting tbb-fingerprinting].</ref>

(New Identity Button will be fixed in Whonix {{Whonix6}} and above.)

== Whonix Proxy Settings / user.js ==

When running <code>torbrowser -update</code>, the update script creates a <code>user.js</code> file, for example <code>~/tor-browser_en-US/Data/profile/user.js</code>. User.js is used to override some Tor Button defaults, namely the SocksProxy settings and other minor misc settings. <ref>If you are curious which these are in details, or for reviewers or auditors, see [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/stable/whonix_workstation/usr/local/bin/torbrowser torbrowser script and user.js on github].</ref> See also the [[Stream_Isolation#Limited_workarounds_for_Tor_Browser|Tor Browser sub chapter]] on the Stream Isolation page.

== More than one Tor Browser in Whonix ==

For better isolation of different identities. For advanced users. Moved to the [[Advanced_Security_Guide#More_than_one_Tor_Browser_in_Whonix|Advanced Security Guide]].

= Manually updating Tor Browser =
(1) Go to https://www.torproject.org/ and/or http://idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion/ and download the Tor Browser Bundle for Linux 32 bit. Store it in ''/home/user/''.

(2) Read https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en and/or http://idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en and learn about gpg verification.

(3) Go to https://www.torproject.org/docs/signing-keys.html.en and/or http://idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion/docs/signing-keys.html.en to get the gpg keys.

(4) Verify the Tor Browser Bundle download.

(5) Go into ''/home/user/'' with the file manger. (Dolphin)

(6) If you still have the old version of TBB opened (because you are probably reading this from the old TBB), close it. (copy the next steps to Kwrite if necessary)

(7) Rename your old TBB /home/user/tor-browser_en-US to something else.

(8) Extract the Tor Browser Bundle. Right click on the downloaded archive -> extract -> extract archive here.

(9) In case you downloaded another version than ''en-US'', rename the tor-browser_''lang'' folder to ''tor-browser_en-US''. This is important, because the paths in the following script are hardcoded.

(10) Go into the ''/home/user/tor-browser_en-US'' folder.

(11) Delete ''start-tor-browser'' or move it to the ''/home/user/tor-browser_en-US/Docs'' folder.

(12) Create a new file within the ''/home/user/tor-browser_en-US/'' folder called ''start-tor-browser'' with the following content.

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
## Whonix Tor Browser start script

export TOR_SKIP_LAUNCH=1
    
cd ~
~/tor-browser_en-US/App/Firefox/firefox --profile ~/tor-browser_en-US/Data/profile
    
## End of Whonix Tor Browser start script
</pre>

(13) Make the ''start-tor-browser'' script executable. Right click on ''start-tor-browser'' -> Properties -> Permissions -> enable the ''Is executable'' box -> ok.

(14) If you want to make 100% sure you never have Tor over Tor, you must shut down Whonix-Gateway while doing the following.

(15) Delete /home/user/my_tor-browser_en-US/App/tor.

(16) If there is '''no''' green Vidalia icon in the task bar, everything is fine.

(17) Start Tor Browser and run

<pre>ps aux | grep tor</pre>

If you see something like.

<pre>109 /usr/sbin/tor</pre>

Or.

<pre>/home/user/my_tor-browser_en-US/App/tor</pre>

Something went wrong and you're running Tor over Tor, which is recommended against.

(18) If the tests results are as expected, everything went fine.

(19) Don't forget to restart Whonix-Gateway, if you shut it down in step (13).

(20) Done.

= More than one Tor Browser in Whonix =
'''WARNING: "More than one Tor Browser in Whonix" instructions have not been updated for TBB 3.x yet!'''

As the [[Warning]] page stated, [[Warning#Whonix_doesn.27t_magically_separate_your_different_contextual_identities | Whonix doesn't magically separate your different contextual identities]] and since Tor Browser and Tor Button do not yet solve this, for further separation of identities you could use [[Multiple Whonix-Workstations]], which would be more secure.

Alternatively, less secure than Multiple Whonix-Workstations, you could start multiple instances of Tor Browser and run them through different SocksPorts. The instructions in the [[Manually Updating Tor Browser]] article need minimal changes.

Instead of

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
## Whonix Tor Browser start script

~/tor-browser_en-US/App/Firefox/firefox --profile ~/tor-browser_en-US/Data/profile

## End of Whonix Tor Browser start script
</pre>

Use

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
## Whonix Tor Browser start script

## Adjust the path!
~/tor-browser_2/App/Firefox/firefox --profile ~/tor-browser_2/Data/profile -no-remote

## End of Whonix Tor Browser start script
</pre>

Only {{Code2|-no-remote}} was added to the start script. Otherwise Tor Browser would connect to the already running Tor Browser and this isn't what you want. And don't forget to adjust the path to the other Tor Browser.

You also have to use a different SocksPort, see [[Tor_Browser#Change.2FRemove_Proxy_Settings|Change/Remove Proxy Settings]]. (See [[Stream Isolation]] page for explanation why you should use different SocksPorts.)

= Trusting the key =
== Download the key from multiple sources ==
A simple technique to increase the trust you can put in the Whonix signing key would be to download it several times, from several locations, several computers, possibly several countries, etc.

You could also use this technique to compare keys downloaded by your friends or other people you trust.

Downloading the key from the same server only lowers the possibility of a man-in-the-middle attack for a part of the route. The following figure illustrates that best:

<pre>
user <-> user ISP <-> internet <-> sourceforge.net ISP <-> sourceforge.net server
MITM less likely for this route |  no help for this route
</pre>

For this reasons adrelanos' homepage, which describes and contains adrelanos' OpenPGP key is mirrored at six different places. Download adrelanos' key from all those places and store it as ''adrelanos1.asc'', ''adrelanos2.asc'', ''adrelanos3.asc'', etc.

4. [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/proper adrelanos' homepage on torproject.org wiki]

SSL available. <ref name=ssl /> Anyone can edit the torproject.org wiki and exchange content with malicious one. Therefore check the history feature. Obviously, I do trust Tor and torproject.org. My wiki account "''proper''" should be genuine, therefore changes by "''proper''" should be legit.

5. [https://savannah.gnu.org/people/viewgpg.php?user_id=89289 adrelanos OpenPGP key mirror on savannah.gnu.org profile page]

7. adrelanos' OpenPGP key in Whonix 6 and above

<pre>

</pre>

Verify:

Each time you re-import the key from a different source:

<pre>
gpg --import adrelanos.asc 
gpg --import adrelanos1.asc

And:

<pre>

= Whonix 7 OLD Known Issues =
=== Connection Issues - Tor stops working after an Upgrade and needs a Workaround === <!--T:98-->
When upgrading to Tor 0.2.4.19-1~d79.jessie+1 (using sudo apt-get dist-upgrade), your Tor connection may go down. There is a temporary workaround.

<!--T:74-->
Open /etc/default/tor.

<!--T:75-->
<pre>
## If you are using a graphical Whonix-Gateway, use:
kdesudo kate /etc/default/tor

<!--T:76-->
## Or alternatively, if you are using a terminal-only Whonix-Gateway, use:
sudo nano /etc/default/tor
</pre>

<!--T:77-->
Scroll down, near bottom comment in (by removing the # in front of it).

<!--T:78-->
<pre>
USE_AA_EXEC="no"
</pre>

<!--T:79-->
Then try:

<!--T:80-->
<pre>
sudo service tor restart
</pre>

<!--T:81-->
You should keep that in mind and undo that change when Whonix or Tor fixes that bug. We'll keep you posted. (See [[Download#Stay_tuned]] and [[Security_Guide#Recommendation_to_install_latest_security_updates_on_all_systems]].)

<!--T:82-->
Forum help thread:
[[Special:AWCforum/st/id287/new_tor_and_debian_updates_today....html]]

=== Virtual Box Shared Folder Issues === <!--T:57-->
Shared Folders aren’t working with the latest Linux kernel. (This is a Debian/Virtual Box issue, not caused by Whonix. Has already been reported to upstream by a Debian user.)

<!--T:58-->
Possible workarounds, more information, etc. can be found in the Whonix User Help Forum discussion thread:
[[Special:AWCforum/st/id261/VirtualBox_shared_directories_on....html]]

=== Tor Browser Starter (Whonix) === <!--T:84-->
After manually upgrading Tor Browser (see above)... To start Tor Browser, got to your /home/user/tor-browser_en-US folder and double click start-tor-browser. Or type in terminal (Konsole).

<!--T:85-->
<pre>
/home/user/tor-browser_en-US/start-tor-browser
</pre>

=== Tor Browser Updater (Whonix) === <!--T:83-->
Currently broken due to changes by torproject.org. You have to [[Manually Updating Tor Browser|manually update Tor Browser]] in meanwhile.

<!--T:56-->
Forum help thread:
[[Special:AWCforum/st/id262/updating_TOR_browser_error...html]]

=== Enigmail Encryption === <!--T:59-->
When using OpenPGP encryption in Icedove / Enigmail you might get "encryption command failed".

<!--T:60-->
Icedove has been updated in Debian Testing in meanwhile. Upgrade it.

<!--T:61-->
<pre>
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
</pre>

<!--T:62-->
You should then install enigmail as usual: <br />
<pre>
sudo apt-get install enigmail
</pre>

=== Defunct Desktop Shortcuts === <!--T:90-->
The desktop shortcuts Tor Browser, Contribute, Forum, Documentation, Donate won't work until there is an upgrade of Whonix. Please manually visit these pages. How to start Tor Browser has already been explained above.

=== Whonix-Gateway: Err: http://deb.torproject.org tor-0.2.4.x-jessie/main i386 Packages 404 Not Found ===
'''Short answer''': <br />
Update and upgrade your underlying Debian system (Whonix is a derivative of Debian).
<pre>
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
</pre>

<!--T:87-->
See also [[Security_Guide#Recommendation_to_install_latest_security_updates_on_all_systems]]. This bug will be fixed with next Whonix upgrade (will take some time). No other action strictly required for now.

<!--T:88-->
'''Long answer''': <br />
This is because torproject deprecated that repository. That was to be expected. The repository we're using now is already preconfigured (in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/torproject.list).

<!--T:89-->
Taking action isn't important at this stage. You can comment it out (by putting a # in front of it) in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/torproject.list if you want. ({{Code|kdesudo kate /etc/apt/sources.list.d/torproject.list}} for graphical Whonix-Gateway or {{Code|sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/torproject.list}} for terminal-only Whonix-Gateway) If you don't do it, it will be auto fixed with next upgrade of Whonix.


=== apt-get Hash Sum mismatch ===
If you get a hash sum mismatch when updating through sudo apt-get update then deleting the package lists should solve it. A hash sum mismatch can look like:

<pre>
W: Failed to fetch http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/dists/testing/contrib/i18n/Translation-enIndex  Hash Sum mismatch
</pre>

<!--T:94-->
To delete the package lists, run:
<pre>
sudo rm -fR /var/lib/apt/lists/*
</pre>

<!--T:95-->
To make sure everything works like it should, update your package lists and upgrade your distro. Chances are that your previous update/upgrade attempts have failed due to the mismatch.

<!--T:96-->
<pre>
sudo apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade
</pre>

<!--T:97-->
(Source <ref>http://askubuntu.com/questions/41605/trouble-downloading-updates-due-to-hash-sum-mismatch-error</ref>)

=== There is no public key available for the following key IDs ===
The message "{{Code2|There is no public key available for the following key IDs}}" is not necessarily an error. It might be just a warning/information.

<!--T:105-->
<pre>
sudo apt-get update
...
Reading package lists... Done
...
W: There is no public key available for the following key IDs:
9C131AD3713AAEEF
</pre>

<!--T:106-->
Check the exit code of apt-get.

<!--T:107-->
<pre>
echo $?
0
</pre>

<!--T:108-->
When it's 0, there is no problem. This is due to key transition, because Whonix's repository is currently signed with the old and the new signing key.
