= Introduction =
Whonix aims at preserving your privacy and anonymity by helping you use your applications anonymously. A web browser, IRC client, word processer, and more come pre-configured with security in mind.

It is a complete operating system designed to be used inside a host operating system, such as your computer's currently installed OS or an OS installed independently on an external drive. It is Free Software and based on Tor<ref>https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en</ref>, Debian GNU/Linux<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian</ref>, and Virtual Box<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VirtualBox</ref>.

= Anonymity online through Tor =

Whonix relies on the Tor network to protect your anonymity online: all connections are either forced through Tor or blocked.

Tor is free software and an open network that helps you defend against a form of network surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and relationships, and state security known as traffic analysis.

Tor protects you by bouncing your communications around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around the world: it prevents somebody watching your Internet connection from learning what sites you visit, and it prevents the sites you visit from learning your physical location.

To learn more about Tor, see the official [https://www.torproject.org/ Tor website]:

* [https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en#whyweneedtor Tor overview: Why we need Tor]
* [https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en#thesolution Tor overview: How does Tor work]
* [https://www.torproject.org/about/torusers.html.en Who uses Tor?]

= Whonix is based on Debian =
{{anchor|Whonix_is_based_on_Debian.2C_VirtualBox_and_Tor}}

To oversimplify it: Whonix is just a collection of configuration files.<ref>{{note}} Plus some shell extra shell scripts, a perl script (tails_htp) and a package selection. Whonix just puts everything together.</ref>

This isn't a stripped down version of Debian. For example, anything <ref>{{note}} Actually only "almost" everything. Any limitations (beside bugs) will be Tor's responsibility. For example, UDP is not supported by Tor yet. Therefore, this won't work.</ref> you can do with "vanilla" Debian GNU/Linux, you can do with Whonix. Likewise, most problems and questions can be solved in the same way. For example: "How do I install xrandr on Whonix?" "The same way you would with Debian ''apt-get install xrandr''". Whonix doesn't break anything and doesn't stop you from using any you want.

Tip: Since Ubuntu is also based on Debian, most online help for Ubuntu also works for Whonix.

= Cryptography =

Whonix contains some State-of-the-art cryptographic tools, a selection of tools to protect your data using strong encryption:

* Automatically encrypt with HTTPS all your communications to a number of major websites using [https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere HTTPS Everywhere], a Firefox extension developed by the [https://www.eff.org Electronic Frontier Foundation].
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard GNU Privacy Guard]

= Summary of what Whonix is =

== What is Whonix? ==

* Whonix is an Anonymous Operating System, that spoofs your own IP/location.
* Tor multiply encrypts the data sent over the Tor network. Neither your access provider nor Tor operators (except for the exit node) can see your plaintext data.
* Tor does regularly change the outgoing IP address.
* Whonix is an Anti-Censorship-Application that allows access to otherwise blocked Internet sites. Advanced users may configure their Whonix as a forwarding server in order to allow others access to the Tor network.
* Whonix is open source and free.
* Tor Browser in Whonix filters and anonymizes HTTP headers.
* For anonymous e-mails please see [[E-Mail]], i.e. use Mozilla Thunderbird with TorBirdy, because it provides special, additional data filtering in the email client itself.
* Whonix is available on all major systems (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux).

== What is Whonix not? ==

* Whonix does NOT make your PC's or router's IP address invisible. Your IP address is assigned to you by your ISP, and it is inalterable by third parties. You need the IP so that the Tor client may successfully connect to the Tor network on the Internet. When using Whonix, you are surfing through Tor servers on the Internet that all have their own separate IP address. The websites accessed by you will only see this respective outgoing address and not yours.
* Whonix does NOT accelerate Internet access. In fact by routing everything through the Tor network it becomes slower.
* Whonix is NOT The Tor Project. Tor is developed by The Tor Project.
* Whonix does not NOT use random "anonymous" proxies (e.g. those on lists of open proxies) to create an anonymous connection. This would be a totally unsafe method that does not lead to anonymization.
* Whonix is NO One-Click-Anonymization-Tool - something like that can and will not really ever exist! Prudence and knowledge remain maxim for Internet security.

= What's next? =

* more details about the [[Features]] of Whonix,
* our [[Documentation]] explaining in details how to use Whonix,
* some hints on why should you [[Trust]] or not Trust Whonix,
* our [[Security Guide]] and [[Design]] document about Whonix specification, threat model and implementation.
