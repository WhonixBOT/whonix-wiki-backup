= Introduction =
Whonix aims to preserve privacy and anonymity by helping users run applications anonymously. A [[Tor Browser|web browser]], [[HexChat|IRC client]], [[Software#Office_Suite|word processor]], and [[Software|more]] come pre-configured with security in mind.

Whonix is a complete operating system. It consists of two virtual machines - Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation - which are designed to be used on a host operating system (OS). The host OS supporting Whonix is usually the one installed on the user's computer, but OSes installed on external drives will also work. Users choose the preferred Whonix configuration and may use either a Type I hypervisor ([[Qubes-Whonix]]), or a Type II hypervisor like [[KVM|KVM]] and [[VirtualBox|Virtualbox]].

Whonix is [[Why_Whonix_is_Free_Software|Free Software]] and is based on Tor <ref>https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en</ref>, Debian GNU/Linux <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian</ref>, and the principle of security by isolation.

= Security by Isolation =

Whonix is divided into two parts: <i>Whonix-Workstation</i> for work activities and <i>Whonix-Gateway</i> to enforce all Internet traffic routing via the Tor network. This security by isolation configuration averts many threats posed by malware, misbehaving applications, and user error.

= Online Anonymity via Tor =

Whonix relies on the Tor network to protect a user's anonymity online; all connections are forced through Tor or otherwise blocked. Tor helps to protect users by bouncing communications around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around the world. Without advanced, end-to-end, netflow correlation attacks, anybody watching a user's Internet connection cannot easily determine the sites visited, and those sites cannot learn the user's physical location. <ref>Current practical, low-latency, anonymity designs like Tor fail when the attacker can see both ends of the communication channel (traffic going into and out of the Tor network). [https://blog.torproject.org/blog/one-cell-enough If both flows are visible], simple statistics can determine whether they match up.</ref>

To learn more about Tor, read the official documentation on the [https://www.torproject.org/ Tor website]:

* [https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en#whyweneedtor Tor overview: Why we need Tor]
* [https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en#thesolution Tor overview: How Tor Works]
* [https://www.torproject.org/about/torusers.html.en Who uses Tor?]

= Based on Debian =
{{Based on Debian}}

= Whonix Version =
Each Whonix release is based on a particular version of Debian:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! <u>Whonix version</u> !! ''Debian Version'' !! Debian Codename
|-
| Whonix <u>{{VersionNew}}</u> || ''8'' || [https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/ jessie]
|}

Note that there is not a specific, fixed Whonix release schedule. A new stable release only becomes available when it is deemed ready. Interested users can query the [https://phabricator.whonix.org/maniphest/ Whonix phabricator manifest] to track developer progress. <ref>For example, for the next release use the tag "Whonix 14" and status "Open".</ref>

= Summary =

== Whonix is ==

* A free and open operating system.
* An anti-censorship tool.
* The first step among many in hiding a user's identity.

== Whonix Helps to == 

* Disguise a user's IP address.
* Prevent ISP spying.
* Prevent websites from identifying the user.
* Prevent malware from identifying the user.
* Circumvent censorship.

== Whonix is not ==

* A one-click anonymization solution.

= Next Steps =

Learning more about Whonix is the best way to determine whether it is a suitable solution in your personal circumstances. The following chapters are recommended:

* The [[Warning]] page to understand the security limitations of Whonix and Tor.
* Further information about Whonix [[Features]].
* The implied [[Trust]] placed in Whonix when it is used.
* The [[Security_Guide|Security Guide]], [[Advanced_Security_Guide|Advanced Security Guide]] and [[Design]] documents detailing the Whonix specifications, threat model and implementation.
* Other relevant [[Documentation|entries]] explaining how to use Whonix safely.
