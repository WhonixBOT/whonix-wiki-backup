= Introduction =
{{project_name}} aims to preserve privacy and anonymity by helping users run applications anonymously. A [[Tor Browser|web browser]], [[HexChat|IRC client]], [[Software#Office_Suite|office suite]], and [[Software|more]] come pre-configured with security in mind.

{{project_name}} is a complete operating system with [https://www.whonix.org/#features advanced security and anonymity features]. It consists of two virtual machines -- [[{{gateway_product_name_short}}|{{gateway_product_name}}]] and [[{{workstation_product_name_short}}|{{workstation_product_name}}]] -- which are designed to be used on a host operating system (OS). The host OS supporting {{project name}} is usually the one installed on the user's computer, but OSes installed on external drives will also work. Users choose the preferred {{project name}} configuration and may use either a Type I hypervisor ([[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]]), or a Type II hypervisor like [[KVM|KVM]] and [[VirtualBox|Virtualbox]].

{{project_name}} is [[Why_{{project_name_short}}_is_Freedom_Software|Freedom Software]] and is based on [[Kicksecure]] ™ (security-focused Linux Distribution), Tor <ref>https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en</ref>, Debian GNU/Linux <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian</ref>, and the principle of security by isolation.

= Security by Isolation =

{{project_name}} is divided into two VMs: {{workstation_product_name}} for work activities and {{gateway_product_name}} to enforce all Internet traffic through the Tor network. <ref>In [[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]], these VMs are named <code>sys-whonix</code> and <code>anon-whonix</code>, respectively.</ref> This security by isolation configuration averts many threats posed by malware, misbehaving applications, and user error.

= Online Anonymity via Tor =

{{project_name}} relies on the Tor network to protect a user's anonymity online; all connections are forced through Tor or otherwise blocked. Tor helps to protect users by bouncing communications around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around the world. Without advanced, end-to-end, netflow correlation attacks, anybody watching a user's Internet connection cannot easily determine the sites visited, and those sites cannot learn the user's physical location. <ref>Current practical, low-latency, anonymity designs like Tor fail when the attacker can see both ends of the communication channel (traffic going into and out of the Tor network). [https://blog.torproject.org/blog/one-cell-enough If both flows are visible], simple statistics can determine whether they match up.</ref>

To learn more about Tor, read the official documentation on the [https://www.torproject.org/ Tor website]:

* [https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en#whyweneedtor Tor overview: Why we need Tor]
* [https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en#thesolution Tor overview: How Tor Works]
* [https://www.torproject.org/about/torusers.html.en Who uses Tor?]

= Based on Debian =
{{Based on Debian}}

{{Anchor|{{project_name}} Version}}
= {{project_name_short}} Version =
Each {{project name}} release is based on a particular version of Debian:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! <u>{{project_name}} version</u> !! ''Debian Version'' !! Debian Codename
|-
| {{project name}} <u>{{VersionNew}}</u> || ''{{Debian Stable Version Number Short}}'' || [https://www.debian.org/releases/buster/ buster]
|}

Users can manually check the {{project name}} version at any time by following [[FAQ#How_do_I_Check_the_Current_{{project_name_short}}_Version.3F|this step]].

{{Anchor|Release and Support Schedule}}

= Release Schedule =
Note that {{project name}} does not have a fixed release schedule. A new stable release only becomes available when it is deemed ready. Interested users can query the [[Reporting_Bugs#Issue_Tracker|issue tracker]] <ref>
For example, for the next release use the tag "{{project_name}} 15" and status "Open".
</ref> and [[{{project name short}}_Release_Notes|release notes]] to track developer progress. [[Stay Tuned]].

= Support Schedule =
=== Debian Hosts ===
'''New Debian Release'''

<u>One month</u> after a new stable version of <u>Debian</u> is released, {{project name}} VMs may no longer be supported on any older version of Debian. All users need to upgrade the Debian platform promptly after the deprecation notice in order to use {{project name}} safely.

'''New {{project name}} Release'''

<u>One month</u> after a new stable version of <u>Whonix</u> is released, older versions will no longer be supported. All users need to upgrade the {{project name}} platform promptly in order to remain safe.

'''Deprecation Notices'''

The deprecation notice is provided at least one month in advance and posted in the [http://forums.whonix.org/c/news {{project name}} News forum]. [[Stay Tuned]]! All users need to upgrade the respective platform promptly in order to remain safe. <ref>This also relieves {{project name}} developers from needing to diagnose and support old-stable versions of Qubes/Debian/{{project_name}}, which duplicates the maintenance burden.</ref>

=== Debian-based and Other Hosts ===
As per [[#Debian Hosts|Debian Hosts]].

=== Windows Hosts ===
The support schedule is mostly undefined at present, but likely to mirror [[#Debian Hosts|Debian Hosts]].

=== Qubes Hosts ===
Quote [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/supported-versions/#whonix [[Qubes|{{q_project_name}}]] version support policy]:

<blockquote>
{{project_name}} TemplateVMs are supported by our partner, the {{project_name}} Project. The {{project_name}} Project has set its own support policy for {{project_name}} TemplateVMs in Qubes.

This policy requires {{project_name}} TemplateVM users to stay reasonably close to the cutting edge by upgrading to new stable versions of Qubes OS and {{project_name}} TemplateVMs within a month of their respective releases. To be precise:
* One month after a new stable version of Qubes OS is released, {{project_name}} TemplateVMs will no longer be supported on any older version of Qubes OS. This means that users who wish to continue using {{project_name}} TemplateVMs on Qubes must always upgrade to the latest stable Qubes OS version within one month of its release.
* One month after new stable versions of {{project_name}} TemplateVMs are released, older versions of {{project_name}} TemplateVMs will no longer be supported. This means that users who wish to continue using {{project_name}} TemplateVMs on Qubes must always upgrade to the latest stable {{project_name}} TemplateVM versions within one month of their release.

We aim to announce both types of events one month in advance in order to remind users to upgrade.

= Next Steps =

Learning more about {{project name}} is the best way to determine whether it is a suitable solution in your personal circumstances. The following chapters are recommended:

* The [[Warning]] page to understand the security limitations of {{project name}} and Tor.
* Further information about {{project name}} [[Features]].
* The implied [[Trust]] placed in {{project name}} when it is used.
* The Security Guide, Advanced Security Guide and [[Design]] chapters detailing the {{project name}} specifications, threat model and implementation.
* Other relevant [[Documentation|Documentation]] explaining how to use {{project name}} safely.
