= Introduction =
Whonix aims at preserving your privacy and anonymity by helping you use your applications anonymously. A [[Tor Browser|web browser]], [[XChat|IRC client]], word processor, and more come pre-configured with security in mind.

It is a complete operating system<ref>Which consists of two virtual machines: Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation</ref> designed to be used inside a host operating system<ref>Such as your currently installed OS on your computer or an OS installed on an external drive.</ref>. It is Free Software and based on Tor<ref>https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en</ref>, Debian GNU/Linux<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian</ref> and security by isolation.

= Security by Isolation =

Whonix is divided into two parts: <u>Whonix-Workstation</u> for your work and <u>Whonix-Gateway</u> for automatically routing all internet traffic through Tor. This is security by isolation, and it averts many threats posed by malware, misbehaving applications, and user error. 

= Anonymity online through Tor =

Whonix relies on the Tor network to protect your anonymity online: all connections are either forced through it or blocked. Tor protects you by bouncing your communications around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around the world. Anybody watching your Internet connection can't see what sites you visit, and the sites you visit can't learn your physical location.

To learn more about Tor, see the official [https://www.torproject.org/ Tor website]:

* [https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en#whyweneedtor Tor overview: Why we need Tor]
* [https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en#thesolution Tor overview: How does Tor work]
* [https://www.torproject.org/about/torusers.html.en Who uses Tor?]

= Based on Debian =

To oversimplify it: Whonix is just a collection of configuration files and scripts.

This isn't a stripped down version of Debian. For example, anything you can do with "vanilla" Debian GNU/Linux, you can do with Whonix. Likewise, most problems and questions can be solved in the same way. For example: "How do I install xrandr on Whonix?" -- "The same way you would with Debian {{Code|apt-get install xrandr}}". Whonix doesn't break anything and doesn't stop you from using anything you want.
