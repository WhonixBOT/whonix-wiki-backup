= Introduction =
Whonix aims to preserve privacy and anonymity by helping users run applications anonymously. A [[Tor Browser|web browser]], [[HexChat|IRC client]], [[Software#Office_Suite|word processor]], and [[Software|more]] come pre-configured with security in mind.

Whonix is a complete operating system. It consists of two virtual machines - Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation - which are designed to be used on a host operating system (OS). The host OS supporting Whonix is usually the one installed on the user's computer, but OS's installed on external drives will also work. Users choose the preferred Whonix configuration and may use either a Type I hypervisor ([[Qubes-Whonix]]), or a Type II hypervisor like [[KVM|KVM]] and [[VirtualBox|Virtualbox]].

Whonix is [[Why_Whonix_is_Free_Software|Free Software]] and is based on Tor <ref>https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en</ref>, Debian GNU/Linux <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian</ref>, and the principle of security by isolation.

= Security by Isolation =

Whonix is divided into two parts: <i>Whonix-Workstation</i> for work activities and <i>Whonix-Gateway</i> to enforce all Internet traffic routing via the Tor network. This security by isolation configuration averts many threats posed by malware, misbehaving applications, and user error.

= Anonymity online through Tor =

Whonix relies on the Tor network to protect your anonymity online: all connections are either forced through it or blocked. Tor protects you by bouncing your communications around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around the world. Anybody watching your Internet connection can't see what sites you visit, and the sites you visit can't learn your physical location.

To learn more about Tor, see the official [https://www.torproject.org/ Tor website]:
