= Introduction =
Whonix aims to preserve privacy and anonymity by helping users run applications anonymously. A [[Tor Browser|web browser]], [[HexChat|IRC client]], [[Software#Office_Suite|office suite]], and [[Software|more]] come pre-configured with security in mind.

Whonix is a complete operating system. It consists of two virtual machines -- Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation -- which are designed to be used on a host operating system (OS). The host OS supporting Whonix is usually the one installed on the user's computer, but OSes installed on external drives will also work. Users choose the preferred Whonix configuration and may use either a Type I hypervisor ([[Qubes-Whonix]]), or a Type II hypervisor like [[KVM|KVM]] and [[VirtualBox|Virtualbox]].

Whonix is [[Why_Whonix_is_Free_Software|Free Software]] and is based on Tor <ref>https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en</ref>, Debian GNU/Linux <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian</ref>, and the principle of security by isolation.

= Security by Isolation =

Whonix is divided into two VMs: Whonix-Workstation for work activities and Whonix-Gateway to enforce all Internet traffic routing via the Tor network. <ref>In [[Qubes-Whonix]], these VMs are named <code>sys-whonix</code> and <code>anon-whonix</code>, respectively.</ref> This security by isolation configuration averts many threats posed by malware, misbehaving applications, and user error.

= Online Anonymity via Tor =

Whonix relies on the Tor network to protect a user's anonymity online; all connections are forced through Tor or otherwise blocked. Tor helps to protect users by bouncing communications around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around the world. Without advanced, end-to-end, netflow correlation attacks, anybody watching a user's Internet connection cannot easily determine the sites visited, and those sites cannot learn the user's physical location. <ref>Current practical, low-latency, anonymity designs like Tor fail when the attacker can see both ends of the communication channel (traffic going into and out of the Tor network). [https://blog.torproject.org/blog/one-cell-enough If both flows are visible], simple statistics can determine whether they match up.</ref>

To learn more about Tor, read the official documentation on the [https://www.torproject.org/ Tor website]:

* [https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en#whyweneedtor Tor overview: Why we need Tor]
* [https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en#thesolution Tor overview: How Tor Works]
* [https://www.torproject.org/about/torusers.html.en Who uses Tor?]

= Based on Debian =
{{Based on Debian}}

= Whonix Version =
Each Whonix release is based on a particular version of Debian:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! <u>Whonix version</u> !! ''Debian Version'' !! Debian Codename
|-
| Whonix <u>{{VersionNew}}</u> || ''9'' || [https://www.debian.org/releases/stretch/ stretch]
|}

Users can manually check the Whonix version at any time by following [[FAQ#How_do_I_Check_the_Current_Whonix_Version.3F|this step]].

{{Anchor|Release and Support Schedule}}

= Release Schedule =
Note that Whonix does not have a fixed release schedule. A new stable release only becomes available when it is deemed ready. Interested users can query the [https://phabricator.whonix.org/maniphest/ Whonix phabricator manifest] <ref>For example, for the next release use the tag "Whonix 15" and status "Open".</ref> and [[Whonix_Release_Notes|release notes]] to track developer progress. [[Stay Tuned]].

= Support Schedule =
=== Debian Hosts ===
'''New Debian Release'''

<u>One month</u> after a new stable version of <u>Debian</u> is released, Whonix VMs may no longer be supported on any older version of Debian. All users need to upgrade the Debian platform promptly after the deprecation notice in order to use Whonix safely.

'''New Whonix Release'''

<u>One month</u> after a new stable version of <u>Whonix</u> is released, older versions will no longer be supported. All users need to upgrade the Whonix platform promptly in order to remain safe.

'''Deprecation Notices'''

The deprecation notice is provided at least one month in advance and posted in the [http://forums.whonix.org/c/news Whonix News forum]. [[Stay Tuned]]! All users need to upgrade the respective platform promptly in order to remain safe. <ref>This also relieves Whonix developers from needing to diagnose and support old-stable versions of Qubes/Debian/Whonix, which duplicates the maintenance burden.</ref>

=== Debian-based and Other Hosts ===
As per [[#Debian Hosts|Debian Hosts]].

=== Windows Hosts ===
The support schedule is mostly undefined at present, but likely to mirror [[#Debian Hosts|Debian Hosts]].

=== Qubes Hosts ===
Quote [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/supported-versions/#whonix Qubes-Whonix version support policy]:

<blockquote>
Whonix is an advanced feature in Qubes OS. Those who wish to use it must stay reasonably close to the cutting edge by upgrading to new stable versions of Qubes OS and Whonix TemplateVMs within a month of their respective releases. To be precise:
* One month after a new stable version of Qubes OS is released, Whonix TemplateVMs will no longer be supported on any older version of Qubes OS. This means that users who wish to continue using Whonix TemplateVMs on Qubes must always upgrade to the latest stable Qubes OS version within one month of its release.
* One month after new stable versions of Whonix TemplateVMs are released, older versions of Whonix TemplateVMs will no longer be supported. This means that users who wish to continue using Whonix TemplateVMs on Qubes must always upgrade to the latest stable Whonix TemplateVM versions within one month of their release.
We aim to announce both types of events one month in advance in order to remind users to upgrade.

= Summary =

== Whonix is ==

* A free and open operating system.
* An anti-censorship tool.
* The first step among many in hiding a user's identity.

== Whonix Helps to == 

* Disguise a user's IP address.
* Prevent ISP spying.
* Prevent websites from identifying the user.
* Prevent malware from identifying the user.
* Circumvent censorship.

== Whonix is not ==

* A one-click anonymization solution.

= Next Steps =

Learning more about Whonix is the best way to determine whether it is a suitable solution in your personal circumstances. The following chapters are recommended:

* The [[Warning]] page to understand the security limitations of Whonix and Tor.
* Further information about Whonix [[Features]].
* The implied [[Trust]] placed in Whonix when it is used.
* The Security Guide, Advanced Security Guide and [[Design]] chapters detailing the Whonix specifications, threat model and implementation.
* Other relevant [[Documentation|Documentation]] explaining how to use Whonix safely.
