Reasons for Automatic Updates:

* Better usability.

Reasons against Automatic Updates:

* Apparently mysterious <ref name=mysterious>to those who don't know that automatic updates are enabled by default</ref> system load.
* Apparently mysterious <ref name=mysterious /> network load.
* Some people may be on different kinds of internet connections. Sometimes they may use a connection with unlimited quota and want to postpone updating.
* If Debian's update mechanism ever gets compromised <ref>If a malicious package was uploaded to Debian's APT repository or if there was a critical bug in apt-get.</ref>, then it would make sense for users to read [[whonixcheck|Whonix News]] before manually updating.
* [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorBOX/Dev/ArchivedDiscussion/SECURITY#SECURITYAutomaticUpdatesREJECTED Old discussion]
* If the user is using Debian a host operating system or connecting to the same mirror,
[[DoNot#Do_not_connect_to_any_server_anonymously_and_non-anonymously_at_the_same_time.21]] applies. (Since using stream isolation, in worst case, as far as I can see, the server only knows what packages you wanted to download, if that happens.)

Needs Research:

* What happens when a stale mirror is detected? Will the user be informed?
* Stale mirror attack not of concern, since exit nodes change anyway?
* Are times when "apt-get update" is run randomized to prevent a clear network fingerprint? If not, this needs a custom implementation/diverting some scripts.
* Are times when "apt-get dist-upgrade" is run randomized to prevent a clear network fingerprint? If not, this needs a custom implementation/diverting some scripts.
* What are the reasons why distributions such as Debian/Ubuntu/Qubes OS are not using automatic updates by default?

Non-issues:

* The Tor Project did not ask us, not to download updates over Tor, see FAQ: [[FAQ#You_should_not_waste_the_Tor_network.27s_bandwith_by_downloading_operating_system_updates_over_Tor.21|You should not waste the Tor network's bandwith by downloading operating system updates over Tor!]]
