= Avoid Shared Hosts =

{{mbox

It is unwise to allow others to use your computer, even if they are trustworthy individuals. If they are not equally knowledgeable in computer security, then one mistake could potentially lead to compromise of the entire system. <ref>If necessary, this risk is partially mitigated by creating untrusted domains in [[Qubes-Whonix]] for other users.</ref>

Needless to say, Whonix should not be hosted in the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing cloud], on a foreign server that is not controlled by the user, on a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server virtual private server (VPS)], or other remote hosting options. The risks include: <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Security_and_privacy</ref> <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_security</ref>

* Data on these systems is readily accessible to their owners.
* Data can be accidentally or deliberately altered / deleted.
* Legal ownership of data is disputed.
* Shared technological vulnerabilities include insecure interfaces and application program interfaces (APIs), data loss / leakage, and hardware failure.
* Proven vulnerability to large scale attacks like [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperjacking "hyperjacking"], along with exposure to traditional threats like network eavesdropping, invasion, denial of service attacks, side-channel attacks and so on.

= Use a Dedicated Host Operating System and Computer =

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text       = Both Non-Qubes-Whonix and [[Qubes-Whonix]] users should avoid [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/multiboot/ dual / multi-boot configurations]. The other OS (like Windows) could modify the unprotected /boot partition or firmware to maliciously compromise Qubes or the host OS, and also potentially spy on user activities.
}}


[[Non-Qubes-Whonix]] users are recommended to use one dedicated host OS just for hosting Whonix VMs. Otherwise, if the host OS which is used on a daily basis is compromised, Whonix cannot provide any additional protection since the host is part of the system's [[#Malware|trusted computing base]]. 

For even greater security, the dedicated host OS can be used on a computer solely bought for Whonix activities. Ideally this computer will have never been used for anything else before, negating the risk of a prior hardware compromise.

= Whonix on External Media =

At this time, Whonix does not provide a [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/262 user-friendly USB creator] (community contributions are welcome!). However, for greater security users can install the host operating system(s) required for Whonix on a dedicated ([[Advanced_Security_Guide#Full_Disk_Encryption|encrypted]]) external disk(s) such as a USB flash drive, FireWire and eSATA devices and so on. 

Using external media reduces the risk of other operating system(s) infecting Whonix's host operating system. When Whonix disk(s) are not in use, they can either be removed or hidden. 

There are a number of online guides explaining how to [https://www.debian.org/CD/live/ install Linux on a USB]. These instructions can be followed to create a live Whonix USB, with the exception that both a supported virtualizer and Whonix must also be installed on the external media.
