= Reputational Considerations =

* For now {{project name}} has a simple design and great reputation. At time of writing, no clearnet IP leak found ever. See [[Security in Real World|{{project name}} Protection against Real World Attacks]].
* If that gets mixed with android-anyting, the quality if leak protection could be lower due to issues causes on the Android, not {{project name}} side.

= Torified WiFi Hotspot =
Even if a WiFi USB stick was added to {{Workstation product name}}... Possible causes for clearnet leaks on the Android side:

* The WiFi could go off / out of range. Then the device might jump to an untorified open WiFi.
* Users might turn off WiFi off while forgetting to keep mobile network (clearnet) turned off.
* madaidan: <blockquote>The mobile device wouldn't be isolated from local networks though. Nothing stops it from bruteforcing your neighbour's WiFi and deanonymizing you that way. Unlike in a Whonix workstation VM, where it can't access those.</blockquote>
* Using a stock android device once non-anonymously, then routing all traffic over Tor would not be as anonymous as expected due to [https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/TransparentProxyLeaks TransparentProxyLeaks].

= Using VPN =
A VPN tunnel from Android to {{Gateway product name}} or {{Workstation product name}}.

Many Android phones do not have a fail closed mechanism. When the VPN connection gets interrupted, device continues to connect without VPN.
