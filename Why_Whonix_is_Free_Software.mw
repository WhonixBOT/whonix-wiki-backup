= Why Whonix will always be free in price as well as Free as in freedom? =

* <u>Security</u>: The public scrutiny of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_by_design security by design] has proven to be superior to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity security through obscurity].
* <u>Legal</u>: Whonix is based on Free Software. <ref>Their licenses do not grant the right to modify and distribute them without sharing the modified source code.</ref>
* <u>Ethical Reasons</u>: We believe it would be immoral to take something that is Free<ref>Such as Debian, Tor, etc.</ref>, make money out of it and give back nothing in return.
* <u>Intellectual Challenge</u>: It is fun having multiple people coordinate and [[Contribute|contributing]] the project. This works best in Free Software / Open Source projects.
* <u>Marketing Reasons</u>: When it is free in price, it can spread faster than commercial tools.
* <u>Commercial Reasons</u>: We hope make a living on what is fun (working on Whonix) by selling additional services ([[Support#Professional_Support|professional support]]) and [[Donate|donations]] some day.
* <u>Professional Reasons</u>: Having volunteered on a Free Software / Open Source project always looks good in a CV or application.
