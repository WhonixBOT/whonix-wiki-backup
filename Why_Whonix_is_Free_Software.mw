= Why Whonix will always be free in price as well as Free as in freedom? =

* <u>Security</u>: The public scrutiny of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_by_design security by design] has proven to be superior to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity security through obscurity].
* <u>Legal</u>: Whonix is based on Free Software. Their licenses do not grant the right to modify and distribute them without sharing the modified source code.
* <u>Ethical</u>: We believe it immoral to take something those Free Software components, make money from then, and give back nothing.
* <u>Community</u>: It is rewarding and fun to have all types of people [[Contribute|contributing]]. This works best in open source projects.
* <u>Impact</u>: When free in price, it can spread faster than commercial tools.
* <u>Commercial</u>: We hope to make a living on Whonix by selling additional services ([[Support#Professional_Support|professional support]]) and [[Donate|donations]].
* <u>Career</u>: Our experience volunteering on this project makes us more valuable.
