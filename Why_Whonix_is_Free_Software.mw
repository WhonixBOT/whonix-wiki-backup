= Why Whonix will always be free in price as well as Free as in freedom? =

* <u>Security Reasons</u>: We believe that robust concepts, mature code and public scrutiny, i.e. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_by_design security by design] has proven to be more secure than [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity security through obscurity].
* <u>Legal Reasons</u>: Whonix is based on Free Software. For many components it is forbidden by law to make them non-free. <ref>Because their licenses don't grant the right to modify and sell them while not sharing modified source code.</ref>
* <u>Ethical Reasons</u>: We believe it would be immoral to take something that is Free, make money out of it and give back nothing in return.
* <u>Intellectual Challenge</u>: It is fun having multiple people coordinate and contributing the project. This works best in Free Software / Open Source projects.
* <u>Marketing Reasons</u>: When it is free in price, it can spread faster than commercial tools. We hope make a living on what is fun (working on Whonix) by selling additional services ([[Support#Professional_Support|professional support]]) and [[Donate|donations]] some day.
