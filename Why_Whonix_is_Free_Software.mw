Why Whonix will always be Free as in Price as well as in Freedom.
}}

* <b>Security:</b> {{Libre Software Security}}
* <b>Legal:</b> Whonix is based on [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html Libre Software]. A lot of Libre licensed software prohibits modification and distribution without sharing the modified source code.
* <b>Ethics:</b> Whonix developers believe it is immoral to benefit from those [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software Free]/Libre Software components and give back nothing. We stand on the shoulders of giants - Whonix and many other Libre software projects are only made possible because people invested in writing code that is kept accessible for the public benefit.
* <b>Community:</b> It is rewarding and enjoyable to have all types of people [[Contribute|contributing]]. This works best in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source Open Source] projects.
* <b>Impact:</b> When free in price, Whonix can spread faster than commercial tools that cannot provide anonymity or privacy by design.
* <b>Commerce:</b> Developers hope to make a living from Whonix by selling additional services. ([[Priority Support]] | [[Professional Support]])
* <b>Career</b>: Our experience volunteering on this project improves our skill set and makes us more valuable employees.
