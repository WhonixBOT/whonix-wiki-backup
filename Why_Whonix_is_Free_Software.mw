= Why Whonix will always be free in price as well as in Freedom? =

* <u>Security</u>: The public scrutiny of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_by_design security by design] has proven to be superior to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity security through obscurity]. This aligns the software development process with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle#Origins Kerckhoffs' principle] - the basis of modern cipher-systems design. The system must be secure even if the enemy knows everything about how it works.
* <u>Legal</u>: Whonix is based on [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html Libre Software]. Their licenses do not grant the right to modify and distribute them without sharing the modified source code.
* <u>Ethical</u>: We believe it immoral to benefit from those [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software Free]/Libre Software components and give back nothing. We stand on the shoulders of giants - Whonix and many other Libre software projects are only made possible because people invested in writing code that is kept available for the community.
* <u>Community</u>: It is rewarding and fun to have all types of people [[Contribute|contributing]]. This works best in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source Open Source] projects.
* <u>Impact</u>: When free in price, it can spread faster than commercial tools that cannot provide anonymity or privacy by design.
* <u>Commercial</u>: We hope to make a living on Whonix by selling additional services ([[Support#Professional_Support|professional support]]) and [[Donate|donations]].
* <u>Career</u>: Our experience volunteering on this project makes us more valuable.
