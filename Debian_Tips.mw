= Introduction = 
This chapter describes how to:

# securely download and verify Debian;
# install Debian as a host operating system; and 
# configure it to minimize the attack surface.

Readers who are interested in running {{project name}} for Debian inside VirtualBox should refer to  [[Debian|this page]].

The meaning of "<code>non-free</code>" might be confusing at first. When the Debian website or other Open Source / Free Software related websites write "<code>non-free</code>" they mean actually "<code>non-free<u>dom</u></code>" (no software freedom or software freedom limitations). Downloads marked "<code>non-free</code>" on the Debian website are always free to download, zero price, free of charge. This also applies generally to most other Debian, Linux and Freedom Software related websites.

Similarly, the meaning of "<code>free</code>" is actually "<code>freedom</code>" which isn't as confusing. It's getting more confusing when negating the meaning with "<code>non-free</code>" as explained above.

This is for historic reasons etc. See footnote for details. <ref>
Similarly, the meaning of "<code>free</code>" means actually <code>non-free<u>dom</u></code>". Except in rare cases, the download and use of Freedom Software ("Free Software") in most cases is free in price.

This is a very old issue. The founders of the Free Software movement and the Free Software Foundation are adamant about calling it "Free Software" rather than "Freedom Software" what it really is about. The user would have to learn the essentials what Free Software is.

= Download and Verification =
This chapter documents how to securely download and perform digital software verification of a Debian installation <code>iso</code> image. The recommended way to verify the Debian Signing key is to use the [[OpenPGP|web of trust]]. This is more secure, but not available to everyone. This chapter documents an alternative and supplementary way to verify the Debian Signing key. It utilizes an existing installation such as for example Debian, Qubes Debian Template, or Ubuntu, which is already considered trusted by the user; for example one bought from a reseller or provided by a friend who verified it.

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Open a terminal.

'''2.''' Open the Debian Stable (<code>{{Stable_project_version_based_on_Debian_codename}}</code>) <code>amd64</code> download page in a web browser.

Choose:

* '''A)''' [https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-dvd/ completely freedom download <code>iso</code>], '''<u>OR</u>''',
* '''B)''' [https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/current/amd64/iso-dvd/ <code>iso</code> including non-freedom ("<code>non-free</code>") device firmware] - This is sometimes necessary for WiFi, suspend and 3D graphics functionality.

Other choices are possible such as the network installation (<code>netinst</code>) CD or other architectures (<code>x86-64</code>) can be substituted if necessary.

This examples uses the following example the non-freedom <code>iso</code> DVD.

If using {{whonix}} or {{kicksecure}} at time of writing to [[Secure Downloads|securely download]] the the command line the following command could be used.

Note: Either adjust the link if later needed or download using a web browser.

{{CodeSelect|code=
scurl-download https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-dvd/debian-11.1.0-amd64-DVD-1.iso
}}

'''3.''' Download necessary files.

At the time of writing, Debian <code>11.1</code> was the latest available ISO image. Change the version to below to reflect any later release:

* <code>SHA512SUMS</code>
* <code>SHA512SUMS.sign</code>
* the <code>.iso</code>, either
** <code>debian-{{Stable project version based on Debian version short}}.1.0-amd64-DVD-1.iso</code> (freedom version), <u>OR</u>
** <code>firmware-{{Stable project version based on Debian version short}}.1.0-amd64-DVD-1.iso</code> (non-freedom version)

'''4.''' Install the <code>debian-keyring</code> package, which contains the Debian signing key. <ref>
[https://www.debian.org/CD/verify Verifying authenticity of Debian CDs]
</ref> 

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install debian-keyring
}}

'''5.''' Change directory.

Navigate to the folder where the files <code>SHA512SUMS</code>, <code>SHA512SUMS.sign</code> and the ISO were downloaded.

'''6.''' Digital software signature verification of the <code>SHA512SUMS</code> file.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/debian-role-keys.gpg --verify SHA512SUMS.sign
}}

'''7.''' Confirm the signature is valid.

The output must show.

<pre>
gpg: Good signature
</pre>

Otherwise something went wrong.

{{GnuPG-Warning}}

'''8.''' Hash sum check

Verify that the <code>.iso</code> matches the signed <code>SHA512SUMS</code> file.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sha512sum --check --ignore-missing SHA512SUMS
}}

The output must show.

<pre>
OK
</pre>

'''9.''' Done.

The procedure of downloading and digital software signature verification of the Debian <code>.iso</code> is complete.

= Installation =

For more detailed information on every step in the installation process consult the Debian manual available in [https://www.debian.org/releases/{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}/amd64/index.en.html HTML] and [https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/install.pdf.en PDF], preferably on another device than the one that will be formatted. 

== Tips ==

To successfully and safely complete the installation, note the following:
* In Linux, the <code>dd</code> utility is utilized to [https://www.debian.org/CD/faq/#write-usb create install media]. 
* In Windows, the Debian install USB/DVD can be created with the rufus utility as described [https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/263636 here].
* From a usability perspective, it is recommended to always have a network connection when installing Debian; see [https://raphaelhertzog.com/2011/06/13/why-you-should-always-have-a-network-connection-when-installing-debian/ here].
* From a security perspective, it is safest to avoid Internet connections until ready; see [https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-manual/ch03s03.en.html here].

== Default Desktop Environment ==

Readers may have noticed the default desktop environment for {{project name}} Virtual Machines is Xfce (although that can be changed). The preferred desktop environment is of little consequence; for example the default Debian desktop environment is GNOME. Users who are already accustomed to {{project name}} (Xfce) can utilize the same environment for the Debian host as well, but this is not compulsory.

<pre>
## Installing KDE, LXDE or Xfce this way works if you are using a DVD image or network installation (but not with CD images)

Debian boot menu &rarr; Advanced Options &rarr; Alternative Desktop Environments &rarr;
Feel free to choose:
- KDE
- LXDE
- Xfce
</pre>

It is also possible to install another desktop environment later on or configure a switch from one to another.

== Other Packages ==

'''2.'''

== Security ==

[https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-manual/ch12.en.html#id-1.13.3.2 Quote]:

<blockquote>'''Is Debian more secure than X?'''

A system is only as secure as its administrator is capable of making it. Debian's default installation of services aims to be secure, but may not be as paranoid as some other operating systems which install all services disabled by default. In any case, the system administrator needs to adapt the security of the system to the local security policy. 
</blockquote>

It is unclear if Debian is referring to running services after installing them or having no services running (no open ports) after an installation with default settings. Debian does not do the latter, which is a pity. Despite Debian's preference for running services after installation, this issue should not distract from the relative strength of the platform when properly configured.

Some useful security links are listed below. Some content in the references are outdated because they only apply to older Debian versions. Similarly, some content does not apply to {{project name}} hosts.
