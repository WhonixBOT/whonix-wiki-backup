This chapter describes how to:
# securely download and verify Debian;
# install Debian as a host operating system; and 
# configure it to minimize the attack surface.

A related description is also available regarding how to configure [[Ubuntu Tips|Ubuntu]] through the {{gateway_product_name}}.

Readers who are interested in running {{project name}} for Debian inside VirtualBox should refer to  [[Debian|this chapter]].

The recommended way to verify the Debian Signing key is to use the [[OpenPGP|web of trust]]. This is more secure, but not available to everyone.

This chapter documents an alternative and supplementary way to verify the Debian Signing key. It utilizes an existing installation such as Ubuntu, which is already trusted; for example one bought from a reseller or provided by a friend who verified it.

In the following example the 64-bit network installation (netinst) CD is used, but other forms (CD, DVD) and architectures (<code>x86-64</code>) can be substituted if necessary.

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Navigate to the [https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/ Debian Stable ({{Stable_project_version_based_on_Debian_codename}}) <code>amd64</code> folder].

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = <u>Important</u>: For compatibility with laptops download the [https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/current/amd64/iso-dvd/ install images] containing the non-free device firmware. This is usually necessary for WiFi, suspend and 3D graphics functionality.
}}

'''2.''' Download necessary files.

At the time of writing, Debian 10.5 was the latest available ISO image. Change the version to below to reflect any later release:

* <code>SHA512SUMS</code>
* <code>SHA512SUMS.sign</code>
* <code>debian-10.5.0-amd64-netinst.iso</code>

'''3.''' Install the <code>debian-keyring</code> package, which contains the signing key. <ref>
[https://www.debian.org/CD/verify Verifying authenticity of Debian CDs]
</ref> 

Downloading the <code>debian-keyring</code> package from the repository will allow <code>apt-get</code> to verify its integrity.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install debian-keyring
}}

'''4.''' Open a terminal.

Navigate to the folder where the <code>SHA512SUMS</code>, <code>SHA512SUMS.sign</code> and <code>debian-10.5.0-amd64-netinst.iso</code> files were downloaded.

'''5.''' Verify the <code>SHA512SUMS</code> file.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/debian-role-keys.gpg --verify SHA512SUMS.sign
}}

'''6.''' Confirm the signature is valid.

The output must show.

<pre>
gpg: Good signature
</pre>

Otherwise something went wrong.

This output might be followed by a warning saying:

<pre>
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
</pre>

This warning does not alter the validity of the signature according to the key you downloaded. Instead, this warning relates to the trust that you place in the key.

'''7.''' Verify that the .iso matches the signed SHA512SUMS file.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sha512sum -c SHA512SUMS {{!}} grep debian-10.5.0-amd64-netinst.iso
}}

The output must show.

 TODO: OK

The procedure is complete.

= Installation =

For more detailed information on every step in the installation process consult the Debian manual available in [https://www.debian.org/releases/buster/amd64/index.en.html HTML] and [https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/install.pdf.en PDF], preferably on another device than the one that will be formatted. 

== Tips ==

To successfully and safely complete the installation, note the following:
* In Linux, the <code>dd</code> utility is utilized to [https://www.debian.org/CD/faq/#write-usb create install media]. 
* In Windows, the Debian install USB/DVD can be created with the rufus utility as described [https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/263636 here].
* From a usability perspective, it is recommended to always have a network connection when installing Debian; see [https://raphaelhertzog.com/2011/06/13/why-you-should-always-have-a-network-connection-when-installing-debian/ here].
* From a security perspective, it is safest to avoid Internet connections until ready; see [https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-manual/ch03s03.en.html here].

== Default Desktop Environment ==

Readers may have noticed the default desktop environment for {{project name}} Virtual Machines is XFCE (although that can be changed). The preferred desktop environment is of little consequence; for example the default Debian desktop environment is GNOME. Users who are already accustomed to {{project name}} (XFCE) can utilize the same environment for the Debian host as well, but this is not compulsory.

<pre>
## Installing KDE, LXDE or Xfce this way works if you are using a DVD image or network installation (but not with CD images)

Debian boot menu &rarr; Advanced Options &rarr; Alternative Desktop Environments &rarr;
Feel free to choose:
- KDE
- LXDE
- Xfce
</pre>

It is also possible to install another desktop environment later on or configure a switch from one to another.

== Other Packages ==

To learn more about the "default", "notebook" or "standard" packages see: [https://wiki.debian.org/tasksel tasksel].

== Open Ports ==

'''UNFINISHED!'''
Check open ports.

{{CodeSelect|code=
su
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
netstat -anltp | grep "LISTEN"
}}

Must should be none, i.e no reply.

Remove services, which open ports. <ref>For documentation purposes a Debian installation has been installed with as much services as possible using taksel, while having a network connection. (Simulating user misunderstanding.) A Debian default installation with default settings does not install all those packages.</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
su
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
apt-get remove dovecot-core openbsd-inetd bind9 samba cups cups-daemon apache2 postgres*
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
apt-get remove exim4 exim4-daemon-light rpcbind openssh-server apache2.2-bin avahi*
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
apt-get autoremove
}}

Check open ports again.

{{CodeSelect|code=
su
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
netstat -anltp | grep "LISTEN"
}}

Must should be none, i.e no reply.

'''NOT YET DOCUMENTED!'''

== Security ==

[http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch12.en.html Quote]:

<blockquote>''Is Debian more secure than X?''

''A system is only as secure as its administrator is capable of making it. Debian's default installation of services aims to be secure, but may not be as paranoid as some other operating systems which install all services disabled by default.''
</blockquote>

Are they referring to running services after installing them or having no services running (open ports) after a default installation with default settings? Debian doesn't do the latter, which is a pity.

Don't participate in popularity contest.

Some useful links. Parts of it are outdated (old Debian versions). Some stuff doesn't apply to {{project name}} hosts.
