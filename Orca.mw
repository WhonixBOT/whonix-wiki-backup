Orca Screen Reader
}}

{{stub}}

= Introduction =
This documentation has been written by a sighted developer without any blind person nearby for testing. Therefore some written advice such as about <code>sudo</code> vs <code>dsudo</code> might be wrong.

= Installation =
The orca screen reader will be installed by default in {{project name}} <code>15.0.1.5.6</code>. Not yet available for download.

= First Start =
== Initial Setup of Orca ==
Prerequisites:

* The orca (or any other) screenreader needs to be already functional on the host operating system. This is unrelated to {{project name}} and outside the scope of this documentation. The user needs to be already comfortable with the host screenreader.
* It is recommended to learn the basics of using VirtualBox outside of any reference to {{project name}}. I.e using VirtualBox with operating systems other than {{project name}}. Being a blind first time user of VirtualBox and {{project name}} at the same time might be a challenging combination.
* If the VirtualBox host user interface itself is accessible has not been tested and is out of scope.

Instructions:

'''1.''' Legal.

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text    = <u>'''Acknowledge that you have read, understood and agreed to our [[Terms of Service|<span style="color:#FF1493;">Terms of Service</span>]] and [[License Agreement|<span style="color:#FF1493;">License Agreement</span>]].'''</u> 
}}

'''2.''' Start {{project name}} using the VirtualBox host user interface normally.

Note that depending on system performance that it could take up to three minutes or so until {{project name}} started. Usually however on fast machines it boots much faster. On a reasonable fast developer machine, booting either {{gateway product name}} or {{workstation product name}} took approximately 30 seconds. An issue is that there is no audio feedback when the boot process has been completed. That is an optimization problem. {{project name}} was originally designed with privacy in mind. Most users would not want to reveal that they are using {{project name}} or just have started any operating system through an audio notification which might be noisy depending on host audio settings.

'''3.''' Wait for the boot process to be completed.

'''4.''' Close [https://github.com/Whonix/setup-wizard-dist <code>setup-wizard-dist</code>].

This is because <code>setup-wizard-dist</code> (and [[Anon Connection Wizard]] GUI (<u>g</u>raphical <u>u</u>ser <u>i</u>nterface) which would be started by <code>setup-wizard-dist</code>) are unfortunately not compatible with screen readers. But this is is only a small issue because and <code>setup-wizard-dist</code> CLI (<u>c</u>ommand <u>l</u>ine <u>i</u>nterface) can be used on the command line and is compatible with screen readers. <code>setup-wizard-dist</code> will be completed in the following step. Alternatively if the user has access to a sighted person, a sighted person could read these interfaces to the user and click according to the user's instructions.

To close <code>setup-wizard-dist</code>, press the following keys.

<code>Alt</code> + <code>F4</code>

'''4.''' Start the Xfce application finder.

Press the following keys.

<code>Alt</code> + <code>F2</code>

'''5.''' Use the <code>eorca</code> utility.

Make sure you read, understood and agreed to [https://gitlab.com/{{Project name short lowercase}}/{{Project name short lowercase}}-base-files/-/raw/master/usr/share/{{Project name short lowercase}}/WHONIX_BINARY_LICENSE_AGREEMENT {{project name}} binary license agreement] and [https://gitlab.com/{{Project name short lowercase}}/{{Project name short lowercase}}-base-files/-/raw/master/usr/share/{{Project name short lowercase}}/WHONIX_DISCLAIMER {{project name}} disclaimer] before continuing.

The following use of the <code>eorca</code> <ref>
* https://gitlab.com/whonix/setup-dist/-/blob/master/usr/bin/eorca
* https://gitlab.com/whonix/setup-dist/-/blob/master/usr/sbin/easyorca-root
</ref> utility will effectively result in:

* '''A)''' Start the orca screen reader.
* '''B)''' Legally accept [https://gitlab.com/{{Project name short lowercase}}/{{Project name short lowercase}}-base-files/-/raw/master/usr/share/{{Project name short lowercase}}/WHONIX_BINARY_LICENSE_AGREEMENT {{project name}} binary license agreement].
* '''C)''' Legally accept [https://gitlab.com/{{Project name short lowercase}}/{{Project name short lowercase}}-base-files/-/raw/master/usr/share/{{Project name short lowercase}}/WHONIX_DISCLAIMER {{project name}} disclaimer].
* '''D)''' Disable autostart of <code>setup-wizard-dist</code> GUI.
* '''E)''' Enable orca autostart. <ref>
https://gitlab.com/whonix/usability-misc/-/blob/master/usr/sbin/orca-enable-autostart
</ref>
* '''F)''' Enable the <code>orca-kill-at-shutdown.service</code> systemd service. <ref>
https://gitlab.com/whonix/usability-misc/-/blob/master/lib/systemd/system/orca-kill-at-shutdown.service
</ref>
* '''G)''' Start Tor connections which results in Tor connecting to the Tor public network. <ref>
Using <code>setup-dist</code>(<code>-noninteractive</code>)<code> 1</code>.

https://gitlab.com/whonix/setup-dist/-/blob/master/usr/sbin/setup-dist-noninteractive
</ref>

Type on the keyboard.

{{CodeSelect|code=
eorca
}}

'''6.''' Press <code>Enter</code> key.

'''7.''' Done.

Initial setup of orca has been completed.

At this time, there is no need to re-run the <code>eorca</code> utility after next boot. Orca will automatically start after next reboot.

= Functional =
Screen reader is at least functional in:

* [[Tor Browser]]
* Xfce start menu
* xfce4-terminal

= Limitations =
* whonixsetup GUI does not work. Use whonixsetup CLI instead as [[#complete whonixsetup|documented above]].
* [[Anon Connection Wizard]] does not work. That should not be an issue for public Tor network users. Users that require the use of bridges could configure these on the command line as documented on the [[Bridges]] page.
* systemcheck GUI (previously called whonixcheck) does not work. Use systemcheck CLI on the command line. Start <code>systemcheck</code> on the command line instead. See also page [[whonixcheck]].
* Whonix Repository Wizard (GUI) does not work. If needed, use <code>whonix_repository</code> CLI instead as documented on page [[Project-APT-Repository]] in chapter Command Line Interface.

= Advanced =
== autostart orca ==
This chapter is usually not required. Already automated by <code>eorca</code>.

'''1.''' Start Xfce application finder.

<code>Alt</code> + <code>F2</code>

'''2.''' Type on the keyboard.

{{CodeSelect|code=
xfce4-terminal
}}

'''3.''' Run the following command.

That is type the following words and press enter.

{{CodeSelect|code=
dsudo orca-enable-autostart
}}

Above command uses <code>dsudo</code> instead of <code>sudo</code>. Not changing {{project name}} default password, i.e. keeping {{project name}} default password <code>changeme</code> as is and using <code>dsudo</code> instead of <code>sudo</code> might be simpler for blind users than using <code>sudo</code> and typing the password. Specifically during the initial setup. See also chapter [[Root#dsudo_-_default_password_sudo|dsudo]]. <ref>
[https://gitlab.com/whonix/usability-misc/blob/master/usr/sbin/orca-enable-autostart<code>orca-enable-autostart</code>]
</ref>

'''4.''' Done.

After reboot, orca should be automatically starting. Once the boot process has been completed and orca has been started there will be audio feedback by orca.

== complete setup-dist ==
This chapter is usually not required. Already automated by <code>eorca</code>.

<code>setup-dist-noninteractive</code> is a tool to non-interactively use <code>setup-dist</code>. Menu option <code>1</code> enables Tor which results in accessing the public Tor network unless the user previously manually configured [[Bridges]].

Only on both {{gateway product name}} and {{workstation product name}}.

{{CodeSelect|code=
dsudo setup-dist-noninteractive 1
}}

== Packages ==
List of packages which are installed and why.

* libatk-adaptor libgail-common - required for Xfce settings menu screen reader support
* non-qubes-audio - required to add audio support to {{gateway product name}}
* gstreamer1.0-plugins-good - [https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=931687 missing dependency in Debian buster]
* xbrlapi - <code>Recommends:</code> by <code>orca</code>
* python3-gst-1.0 - <code>Recommends:</code> by <code>orca</code>
* speech-dispatcher-espeak-ng - without it <code>spd-say test</code> fails
* sound-icons - might be optional
