Orca Screen Reader
}}

{{stub}}

= Introduction =
This documentation has been written by a sighted developer without any blind person nearby for testing. Therefore some written advice such as about <code>sudo</code> vs <code>dsudo</code> might be wrong.

= Installation =
The orca screen reader will be installed by default in {{project name}} <code>15.0.1.5.6</code>. Not yet available for download.

= First Start =
The orca (or any) screenreader needs to be already functional on the host. Start {{project name}} using the VirtualBox user interface. If the VirtualBox user interface itself is accessible hasn't been tested and is out of scope. It is recommended to learn the basics of using VirtualBox outside of any reference to {{project name}}. I.e using VirtualBox with operating systems other than {{project name}}. Being a blind first time user of VirtualBox and {{project name}} at the same time might be a challenging combination.

Start {{project name}} normally. Note that depending on system performance that it could take up to three minutes or so until {{project name}} started. Usually however on fast machines it boots much faster. On a reasonable fast developer machine, booting either {{gateway product name}} or {{workstation product name}} took approximately 30 seconds. An issue is that there is no audio feedback when the boot process has been completed. That is an optimization problem. {{project name}} was originally designed with privacy in mind. Most users would not want to reveal that they are using {{project name}} or just have started any operating system through an audio notification which might be noisy depending on host audio settings.

'''1.''' Start {{gateway product name}}

'''2.''' Wait for the boot process to be completed.

'''3.''' Close [[Anon Connection Wizard]] / [https://github.com/Whonix/whonixsetup whonixsetup].

This is because Anon Connection Wizard GUI (graphical user interface) and whonixsetup GUI are unfortunately not compatible with screen readers. But this is is only a small issue because Anon Connection Wizard CLI (command line interface) and whonixsetup CLI can be used on the command line and are compatible with screen readers. Anon Connection Wizard / whonixsetup will be completed in a later step. Alternatively if the user has access to a sighted person, a sighted person could read these interfaces and click according to the user's instructions.

To close Anon Connection Wizard / whonixsetup, press the following keys.

<code>Alt</code> + <code>F4</code>

'''4.''' Start the Xfce application finder.

Press the following keys.

<code>Alt</code> + <code>F2</code>

'''5.''' Type on the keyboard.

{{CodeSelect|code=
orca
}}

'''6.''' Press <code>Enter</code> key.

'''7.''' Done. Orca has been started.

The key combination <code>Alt</code> + <code>F2</code> opens Xfce application finder with the input field to already in focus. There will be no audio feedback because orca has not been started at this point. To simplify this for the next boot, follow instructions in the next chapter [[#Autostart|Autostart]].

= Autostart =
'''1.''' Start Xfce application finder.

<code>Alt</code> + <code>F2</code>

'''2.''' Type on the keyboard.

{{CodeSelect|code=
xfce4-terminal
}}

'''3.''' Run the following command.

That is type the following words and press enter.

{{CodeSelect|code=
dsudo orca-enable-autostart
}}

Above command uses <code>dsudo</code> instead of <code>sudo</code>. Not changing {{project name}} default password, i.e. keeping {{project name}} default password <code>changeme</code> as is and using <code>dsudo</code> instead of <code>sudo</code> might be simpler for blind users than using <code>sudo</code> and typing the password. Specifically during the initial setup. See also chapter [[Root#dsudo_-_default_password_sudo|dsudo]]. <ref>
[https://gitlab.com/whonix/usability-misc/blob/master/usr/sbin/orca-enable-autostart<code>orca-enable-autostart</code>]
</ref>

'''4.''' Done.

After reboot, orca should be automatically starting. Once the boot process has been completed and orca has been started there will be audio feedback by orca.

= Limitations =
* whonixsetup GUI does not work. Use whonixsetup CLI instead.
* Whonix Repository Wizard (GUI) does not work. If needed, use whonix_repository CLI instead as documented on page [[Project-APT-Repository]] in chapter Command Line Interface.

= Packages =
* libatk-adaptor libgail-common - required for Xfce settings menu screen reader support
* non-qubes-audio - required to add audio support to {{gateway product name}}
* gstreamer1.0-plugins-good - [https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=931687 missing dependency in Debian buster]
* xbrlapi - <code>Recommends:</code> by <code>orca</code>
* python3-gst-1.0 - <code>Recommends:</code> by <code>orca</code>
* speech-dispatcher-espeak-ng - without it <code>spd-say test</code> fails
* sound-icons - might be optional

= Issues =
* issues on Kicksecure host: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/orca/-/issues/176
