Orca Screen Reader

= Introduction =
This documentation has been written by a sighted developer without any blind person nearby for testing. Therefore some written advice such as about <code>sudo</code> vs <code>dsudo</code> might be wrong.

= Installation =
The orca screen reader will be installed by default in {{project name}} <code>15.0.1.5.6</code>. Not yet available for download.

= Start =
The orca (or any) screenreader needs to be already functional on the host. Start {{project name}} using the VirtualBox user interface. If the VirtualBox user interface itself is accessible hasn't been tested and is out of scope. Start {{project name}} normally. Note that depending on system performance that it could take up to three minutes or so until {{project name}} started. Usually however on fast machines it boots much faster. On a reasonable fast developer machine, booting either {{gateway product name}} or {{workstation product name}} took approximately 30 seconds. An issue is that there is no audio feedback when the boot process has been completed. That is an optimization problem. {{project name}} was originally designed with privacy in mind. Most users would not want to reveal that they are using {{project name}} or just have started any operating system through an audio notification which might be noisy depending on host audio settings.

Once the boot process has been completed, that is when the desktop appears, press the following buttons.

<code>Alt</code> + <code>F2</code> and type

{{CodeSelect|code=
orca
}}

Press <code>Enter</code> key.

The key combination <code>Alt</code> + <code>F2</code> opens Xfce application finder with the input field to already in focus. There will be no audio feedback because orca has not been started at this point.

= Autostart =
To autostart orca after reboot run following command.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo orca-enable-autostart
}}

= Packages =
* libatk-adaptor libgail-common - required for Xfce settings menu screen reader support
* non-qubes-audio - required to add audio support to {{gateway product name}}
* gstreamer1.0-plugins-good - [https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=931687 missing dependency in Debian buster]
* xbrlapi - <code>Recommends:</code> by <code>orca</code>
* python3-gst-1.0 - <code>Recommends:</code> by <code>orca</code>
* speech-dispatcher-espeak-ng - without it <code>spd-say test</code> fails
* sound-icons - might be optional

= Issues =
* issues on Kicksecure host: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/orca/-/issues/176
