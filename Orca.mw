Orca Screen Reader
}}

{{stub}}

= Introduction =
This documentation has been written by a sighted developer without any blind person nearby for testing. Therefore some written advice such as about <code>sudo</code> vs <code>dsudo</code> might be wrong.

= Installation =
The orca screen reader will be installed by default in {{project name}} <code>15.0.1.5.6</code>. Not yet available for download.

= First Start =
== Initial Start of Orca ==
The orca (or any) screenreader needs to be already functional on the host. Start {{project name}} using the VirtualBox user interface. If the VirtualBox user interface itself is accessible has not been tested and is out of scope. It is recommended to learn the basics of using VirtualBox outside of any reference to {{project name}}. I.e using VirtualBox with operating systems other than {{project name}}. Being a blind first time user of VirtualBox and {{project name}} at the same time might be a challenging combination.

Start {{project name}} normally. Note that depending on system performance that it could take up to three minutes or so until {{project name}} started. Usually however on fast machines it boots much faster. On a reasonable fast developer machine, booting either {{gateway product name}} or {{workstation product name}} took approximately 30 seconds. An issue is that there is no audio feedback when the boot process has been completed. That is an optimization problem. {{project name}} was originally designed with privacy in mind. Most users would not want to reveal that they are using {{project name}} or just have started any operating system through an audio notification which might be noisy depending on host audio settings.

'''1.''' Start {{gateway product name}}

'''2.''' Wait for the boot process to be completed.

'''3.''' Close [[Anon Connection Wizard]] / [https://github.com/Whonix/whonixsetup whonixsetup].

This is because Anon Connection Wizard GUI (graphical user interface) and whonixsetup GUI are unfortunately not compatible with screen readers. But this is is only a small issue because Anon Connection Wizard CLI (command line interface) and whonixsetup CLI can be used on the command line and are compatible with screen readers. Anon Connection Wizard / whonixsetup will be completed in a later step. Alternatively if the user has access to a sighted person, a sighted person could read these interfaces and click according to the user's instructions.

To close Anon Connection Wizard / whonixsetup, press the following keys.

<code>Alt</code> + <code>F4</code>

'''4.''' Start the Xfce application finder.

Press the following keys.

<code>Alt</code> + <code>F2</code>

'''5.''' Type on the keyboard.

{{CodeSelect|code=
eorca
}}

'''6.''' Press <code>Enter</code> key.

'''7.''' Done. Orca has been started.

= Functional =
Screen reader is at least functional in:

* [[Tor Browser]]
* xfce4-terminal

= Limitations =
* whonixsetup GUI does not work. Use whonixsetup CLI instead as [[#complete whonixsetup|documented above]].
* [[Anon Connection Wizard]] does not work. That should not be an issue for public Tor network users. Users that require the use of bridges could configure these on the command line as documented on the [[Bridges]] page.
* systemcheck GUI (previously called whonixcheck) does not work. Use systemcheck CLI on the command line. Start <code>systemcheck</code> on the command line instead. See also page [[whonixcheck]].
* Whonix Repository Wizard (GUI) does not work. If needed, use <code>whonix_repository</code> CLI instead as documented on page [[Project-APT-Repository]] in chapter Command Line Interface.

= Advanced =
== autostart orca ==
This chapter is usually not required. Already automated by <code>eorca</code>.

'''1.''' Start Xfce application finder.

<code>Alt</code> + <code>F2</code>

'''2.''' Type on the keyboard.

{{CodeSelect|code=
xfce4-terminal
}}

'''3.''' Run the following command.

That is type the following words and press enter.

{{CodeSelect|code=
dsudo orca-enable-autostart
}}

Above command uses <code>dsudo</code> instead of <code>sudo</code>. Not changing {{project name}} default password, i.e. keeping {{project name}} default password <code>changeme</code> as is and using <code>dsudo</code> instead of <code>sudo</code> might be simpler for blind users than using <code>sudo</code> and typing the password. Specifically during the initial setup. See also chapter [[Root#dsudo_-_default_password_sudo|dsudo]]. <ref>
[https://gitlab.com/whonix/usability-misc/blob/master/usr/sbin/orca-enable-autostart<code>orca-enable-autostart</code>]
</ref>

'''4.''' Done.

After reboot, orca should be automatically starting. Once the boot process has been completed and orca has been started there will be audio feedback by orca.

== complete setup-dist ==
This chapter is usually not required. Already automated by <code>eorca</code>.

<code>setup-dist-noninteractive</code> is a tool to non-interactively use <code>setup-dist</code>. Menu option <code>1</code> enables Tor which results in accessing the public Tor network unless the user previously manually configured [[Bridges]].

Only on both {{gateway product name}} and {{workstation product name}}.

{{CodeSelect|code=
dsudo setup-dist-noninteractive 1
}}

== Packages ==
List of packages which are installed and why.

* libatk-adaptor libgail-common - required for Xfce settings menu screen reader support
* non-qubes-audio - required to add audio support to {{gateway product name}}
* gstreamer1.0-plugins-good - [https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=931687 missing dependency in Debian buster]
* xbrlapi - <code>Recommends:</code> by <code>orca</code>
* python3-gst-1.0 - <code>Recommends:</code> by <code>orca</code>
* speech-dispatcher-espeak-ng - without it <code>spd-say test</code> fails
* sound-icons - might be optional
