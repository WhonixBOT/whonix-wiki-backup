[https://github.com/GNOME/orca Orca] is: 

<blockquote>...a free, open source, flexible, and extensible screen reader that provides access to the graphical desktop via user-customizable combinations of speech and/or braille.

Orca works with applications and toolkits that support the assistive technology service provider interface (AT-SPI), which is the primary assistive technology infrastructure for the Solaris and Linux operating environments.</blockquote>

This documentation has been written by a sighted developer without the input of a blind person for testing purposes. Therefore some written advice might be incorrect, such as instructions concerning the use of <code>sudo</code> vs <code>dsudo</code>. <ref><code>dsudo</code> allows commands to be run as root without entering a password, so long as the default password has not been changed.</ref>

At the time of writing (21 February 2021), the Orca screen reader is not installed in the {{project_name}} stable (default) release. Testers must install {{project name}} <code>15.0.1.6.4</code>: 

* https://download.whonix.org/ova/15.0.1.6.4/Whonix-XFCE-15.0.1.6.4.ova
* https://download.whonix.org/ova/15.0.1.6.4/Whonix-XFCE-15.0.1.6.4.ova.asc

= Orca Configuration =

== Prerequisites ==

Orca (or any other) screenreader must already be functional on the host operating system. This is unrelated to {{project name}} and outside the scope of this documentation. The user should be familiar and comfortable with the host screenreader.

It is also recommended to learn VirtualBox basics outside of any reference to {{project name}}; that is,  using VirtualBox with any other operating system. Otherwise, any blind users simultaneously utilizing VirtualBox and {{project name}} for the first time might face serious challenges.

These instructions have not tested whether the VirtualBox host user interface is itself accessible; this functionality is out of scope.

== Bridges Functionality ==

Orca was only recently integrated into {{project name}}, therefore support for using Orca in combination with Tor [[Bridges]] is not perfect yet -- please post a feature request if that is desirable. Bridge users should refer to the footnote for a workaround. <ref>First disable the host internet connection and follow these steps: 
<code>Setup bridges</code> &rarr; <code>Reconnect host internet connection</code> &rarr; <code>Make sure host internet connection is functional</code> &rarr; <code>Restart Tor or reboot {{project name}} if not connected yet</code>.</ref>

== Initial Setup ==
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Agree to {{project_name}} legal terms.

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text    = <u>'''Acknowledge that you have read, understood and agreed to our [[Terms of Service|<span style="color:#FF1493;">Terms of Service</span>]] and [[License Agreement|<span style="color:#FF1493;">License Agreement</span>]].'''</u> 
}}

'''2.''' Start {{project name}} using the VirtualBox host user interface normally.

Depending on system performance it can take up to three minutes or more until {{project name}} starts, although on fast machines it boots much quicker. On a reasonable fast developer machine, booting either {{gateway product name}} or {{workstation product name}} took approximately 30 seconds. 

One issue is that there is no audio feedback when the boot process finishes. This is an optimization problem because {{project name}} was originally designed with privacy in mind. Most {{project_name}} users would not want to reveal they are using the platform or otherwise signal they are using an operating system via an audio notification which might be noisy depending on host audio settings.

'''3.''' Wait for the boot process to finish.

'''4.''' Start the Xfce application finder.

Press the following keys in combination.

<code>Alt</code> + <code>F2</code>

'''5.''' Use the <code>easo</code> utility.

<code>easo</code> is spelled <code>e</code>, <code>a</code>, <code>s</code>, <code>o</code>. This is an easy to type abbreviation for easyorca. <ref>
It could not be named easyorca for technical reasons; avoiding the letter y inside <code>easo</code> circumvents issues relating to English versus German keyboard layouts. See: [https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/orca/-/issues/189 orca --replace should not kill script which is starting it].
</ref>

Make sure you read, understood and agreed to [https://gitlab.com/{{Project name short lowercase}}/{{Project name short lowercase}}-base-files/-/raw/master/usr/share/{{Project name short lowercase}}/WHONIX_BINARY_LICENSE_AGREEMENT {{project name}} binary license agreement] and [https://gitlab.com/{{Project name short lowercase}}/{{Project name short lowercase}}-base-files/-/raw/master/usr/share/{{Project name short lowercase}}/WHONIX_DISCLAIMER {{project name}} disclaimer] before continuing.

Running the <code>easo</code> utility <ref>
* https://gitlab.com/whonix/setup-dist/-/blob/master/usr/bin/easo
* https://gitlab.com/whonix/setup-dist/-/blob/master/usr/sbin/easyorca-root
</ref> has several effects.
{{Box|text=
# Sets volume inside the virtual machine to 50%. <ref>
By running command <code>amixer set Master 50%</code>. <code>50%</code> was arbitrarily chosen and is hopefully not too quiet / noisy. It can be regulated using the host operating system or physical speaker volume control.

}}
Type on the keyboard.

{{CodeSelect|code=
easo
}}

And press the <code>Enter</code> key.

'''6.''' Wait 10 seconds.

This allows Orca startup and the initial Orca setup to finish.

'''7.''' Wait for notification.

There should be an audio notification from Orca stating "screenreader on" -- the initial setup of Orca is complete.

At this time there is no need to re-run the <code>easo</code> utility after next boot. Orca will automatically start after next reboot, followed by an audio notification: "screenreader on".

'''8.''' ''Optional'': run systemcheck.

Running <code>systemcheck</code> is recommended, see: [[whonixcheck]].
}}

= Functionality =

The Orca screen reader is tested as functional in the following applications (non-exhaustive list):
* Xfce start menu
* xfce4-terminal
* Xfce application finder
* [[Tor Browser]]

There are several limitations at present:
* whonixsetup GUI does not work. Use whonixsetup CLI on the command line instead. <ref>Run <code>sudo whonixsetup</code> in a terminal.</ref> 
* [[Anon Connection Wizard]] does not work. This is normally not an issue for public Tor network users, but those requiring bridges could configure these on the command line as documented on the [[Bridges]] page.
* systemcheck GUI (previously called whonixcheck) does not work. Use systemcheck CLI on the command line instead. <ref>Run <code>systemcheck</code> in a terminal.</ref> Also see: [[whonixcheck]].
* Whonix Repository Wizard (GUI) does not work. If needed, use <code>whonix_repository</code> CLI instead as documented [[Project-APT-Repository#Command_Line_Interface|here]].

== Autostart Orca ==

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = This chapter is usually not required because these steps are already automated by <code>easyo</code>.
}}

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Start Xfce application finder.

Press these keys in combination.

<code>Alt</code> + <code>F2</code>

'''2.''' Launch a terminal.

Type.

{{CodeSelect|code=
xfce4-terminal
}}

And press <code>Enter</code>.

'''3.''' Enable Orca autostart.

Type.

{{CodeSelect|code=
dsudo orca-enable-autostart
}}

And press <code>Enter</code>. <ref>This command uses <code>dsudo</code> instead of <code>sudo</code> because  commands can be run as root without entering a password, so long as the default password has not been changed. For blind users this is likely far simpler than using <code>sudo</code> and typing the password, especially during the initial setup. See: [[Root#dsudo_-_default_password_sudo|dsudo]] for further information. </ref> <ref>[https://gitlab.com/whonix/usability-misc/blob/master/usr/sbin/orca-enable-autostart<code>orca-enable-autostart</code>]</ref>

'''4.''' Done.

After reboot, Orca should now automatically start. Once the boot process finishes and Orca has started there will be an audio notification.
}}

== complete setup-dist ==
This chapter is usually not required. Already automated by <code>easyo</code>.

<code>setup-dist-noninteractive</code> is a tool to non-interactively use <code>setup-dist</code>. Menu option <code>1</code> enables Tor which results in accessing the public Tor network unless the user previously manually configured [[Bridges]].

Only on both {{gateway product name}} and {{workstation product name}}.

{{CodeSelect|code=
dsudo setup-dist-noninteractive 1
}}

== Packages ==
List of packages which are installed and why.

* libatk-adaptor libgail-common - required for Xfce settings menu screen reader support
* non-qubes-audio - required to add audio support to {{gateway product name}}
* gstreamer1.0-plugins-good - [https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=931687 missing dependency in Debian buster]
* xbrlapi - <code>Recommends:</code> by <code>orca</code>
* python3-gst-1.0 - <code>Recommends:</code> by <code>orca</code>
* speech-dispatcher-espeak-ng - without it <code>spd-say test</code> fails
* sound-icons - might be optional

== Issues ==
* issues on Kicksecure host: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/orca/-/issues/176
* shutdown takes a long time with orca enabled: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/orca/-/issues/188#note_1027211 Worked around using <code>orca-kill-at-shutdown.service</code> systemd service. <ref name=orca-kill-at-shutdown.service/>
