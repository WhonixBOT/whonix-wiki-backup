sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
</pre>

OR, You can right click the Whonix templateVM in Qubes Manager and select Update ***note that as of early Sept. 2015, this function does not appear to work, Whonix is working on it***

'''6. Shutdown Whonix TemplateVM'''

In Dom0 -> Qubes VM Manager:
<pre>
* Select Whonix TemplateVM:
** Shutdown selected VM
</pre>

'''8. Restart/Update Whonix VMs'''
If new updates were available and installed, you will need to either simply restart your running Whonix-Gateway ProxyVMs and running Whonix-Workstation AppVMs for them to be updated -- or alternatively apply this same update process again to your running VMs if not wanting to restart them right away.
