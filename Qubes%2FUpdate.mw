'''Preparation Step 1) Every Day Upgrade vs Release Upgrade'''

This is for every day upgrading of Qubes-Whonix. This is not [[Release Upgrade]].

{{Release Upgrade}}

Before applying a release upgrade it however is useful to do an every day upgrade first as documented below.

'''Preparation Step 2) Open a TemplateVM Terminal'''

<code>
Qubes App Menu(blue/grey "Q") -> Template: whonix-<u>gw</u> -> Konsole
</code>

<code>
Qubes App Menu(blue/grey "Q") -> Template: whonix-<u>ws</u> -> Konsole
</code>

'''Preparation Step 3.) Note'''

The following steps should be applied in both TemplateVM terminals.

{{Operating System Updates}}

Shutdown Whonix TemplateVM

<code>
Qubes VM Manager -> right click on TemplateVM -> Shutdown VM
</code>

'''8. Restart/Update Whonix VMs'''

If new updates were available and installed, you will need to either simply restart your running Whonix-Gateway ProxyVMs and running Whonix-Workstation AppVMs for them to be updated -- or alternatively apply this same update process again to your running VMs if not wanting to restart them right away.
