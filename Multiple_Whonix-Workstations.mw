== Introduction ==

For tasks where you want to use additional software you should use a second (or third) VM, you can make a clone. Consider this more of a pseudonymous than an anonymous environment and act accordingly.

Multiple Whonix-Workstation VM's isolate different torified clients from each other. For example, an exploit in the browser can not read your IRC identity in another VM. However, keep in mind, if Tor inside the Whonix-Gateway or your host internet connection goes offline, all Whonix-Workstations will go offline, and if you were simultaneously using something, an attacker could guess, that you are the same person (i.e. two Tor users in one IRC channel go offline at the same moment).

The most safe thing to do is using only one Whonix-Workstation for one activity at the same time.

Leaving multiple Whonix-Workstations running at the same time introduces also new risks. One compromised Whonix-Workstation can perform various attacks. It's impossible to defeat all those attacks. Depending on the adversary's skills and assumptions and your activity in other Whonix-Workstations, he could correlate various running Whonix-Workstations to the same pseudonym.

* An adversary could stress either/and CPU, HDD, RAM, network connection and other Whonix-Workstations and perhaps also the host would suffer.
* There is no defense against DOSing other Whonix-Workstations or the Whonix-Gateway.
* The adversary could try to exploit other Whonix-Workstations or the Whonix-Gateway. This risk can be reduced by hardening. Whonix-Workstation provides an optional (disabled by default, because it can get into the way for other tasks) firewall (under "/usr/local/bin/whonix_firewall") to isolate different Whonix-Workstations from each other.
* A defense against impersonating (i.e. MITM or malicious gateway) other Whonix-Workstations or the Whonix-Gateway can be implemented using authentication, this is linked in the "More Security" section below.

== How to use more than one Whonix-Workstation - EASY ==

The following instructions only apply for Download/Default-Whonix-Workstations or if you build yourself from source code. If you want to use other operating systems, such as Windows, other Linux, BSD etc. please see the [[Other Operating Systems]] article instead.

To setup a second or any additional Whonix-Workstation only two minor details are required. It needs its own MAC address and its own internal LAN IP address.

(1). Additional Whonix-Workstation and separate MAC address.

Clone a clean Whonix-Workstation. This will assign a new MAC address to the newly created Whonix-Workstation.

Or in case you imported an extra Whonix-Workstation, go to Virtual Box -> Settings -> Network -> Adapter 1 -> Advanced -> Mac Address -> Create a new MAC address (press the green round arrow icon) -> Ok.

(2). Open /etc/network/interfaces.

<pre>sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces</pre>

(3). And change the last octet. E.g. 192.168.0.'''11''' or 192.168.0.'''12'''.

(4). Reboot or restart network using

<pre>sudo service networking restart</pre>

(4). Done.

See [[Connections between Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation]].

=== Multiple Whonix-Gateways ===
'''Advanced users only.'''

You could also use two or more Whonix-Gateways. This comes with both, advantages and disadvantages. It's more secure, in case one Whonix-Gateway got compromised, the other one is not necessarily compromised as well. A disadvantage is, that you end up with a different set of Tor entry guards - unless you take precautions<ref>Such as manually sharing your entry guards (no documentation ever written to my knowledge) or using the same [[Bridges]]</ref>. Your ISP could guess, that you are using two different Tor data folders, for whatever that's worth. (If you are using multiple TBB's, you end up with different sets of Tor entry guards as well.

Using multiple Whonix-Gateways is more simple and more secure, when you are not using them at the same time.

When you are using them at the same time, the risks explained in the introduction chapter on this page apply. In this case, you also have to change Whonix-Gateway network interface2 and Whonix-Workstation network interface1 from internal network "Whonix" to something else.
