== Introduction ==

Whonix is a secure operating system comprised of two virtual machines which are isolated both from each other and the host. This configuration averts many threats posed by malware, misbehaving applications, and user error. While Whonix protects against real world threats, it still possible for an adversary with the proper skills to compromise Whonix-Workstation (anon-whonix Qubes-Whonix). Moreover, if only one Whonix-Workstation is used for anonymous activities, the attacker would have access to all data on the Whonix-Workstations and could monitor all online activity. To minimize the impact of compromise, users are encouraged to use muliple Whonix-Workstations to compartmentalize different identities and/or additional software. Depending on the users requirements, a second (or nth) Whonix-Workstation VM could be used.

'''Why use multiple Whonix-Workstations'''

Mulitple Whonix-Workstations can be used to run different torifed clients in isolated Whonix-Workstation VMs. By compartmentalizing each different identity or client, an attacker can read only the data in the compromised VM. For example, if Tor Browser in VM-1 was compromised it could not read your IRC identity in VM-2.  However, keep in mind, if Tor inside the Whonix-Gateway or your host internet connection goes offline, all Whonix-Workstations will go offline. If multiple Tor clients were running simultaneously, an attacker could guess that you are the same person. For example, if two Tor users in one IRC channel go offline at the same moment.

'''Qubes-Whonix vs Non-Qubes-Whonix'''

When using multiple Whonix-Workstations, [[Qubes|Qubes-Whonix]] is the recommended choice. This is because [[Qubes|Qubes-Whonix]] is specifically designed for compartmentalization (a.k.a. sandboxing) within multiple running VMs. This gives [[Qubes|Qubes-Whonix]] a significant advantage in both speed and security when compared to the traditional model of running multiple Virtual Machines within an existing OS (for example, running two VM's under [[VirtualBox]] or [[KVM]]). For more information, see [[Qubes/Why_use_Qubes_over_other_Virtualizers|Why use Qubes over other Virtualizers]].

Qubes-Whonix also provides the benefit of a TemplateBased filesystem which saves time and provides much better usability over to Non-Qube-Whonix. 

Centralized updates - AppVMs are based on a TemplateVM. This means their root filesystem is based on the root filesystem of the corresponding template. Users need only update the TemplateVM and those updates will be reflected in TemplateBasedVM's root filesystem. This saves a great amount of time over Non-Qubes-Whonix which requires each VM to be updates individaully.
 
Minimal disk usage - TemplateBasedVMs require much less disk space than traditinal Virtual Machines. Since the AppVM's root filesystem is based the corresponding template. The AppVM only requires enough disk space to hold user files in the /home directory

VM management - Cloning VMs is a simple two step process which can be done in Qubes Manager. This is a time saver compared to Non-Qubes-Whonix that uses a multi-step process to clone and configure each VM. 


'''Safety-precautions'''

While multiple Whonix-Workstations are recommended, it is safer to use only one Whonix-Workstation at any given time, and for a single activity.

Leaving multiple Whonix-Workstations running at the same time introduces new risks. If one of the Whonix-Workstation VMs was compromised, it can perform various attacks and not all of them can be defeated. Depending on the activities a user was performing in other Whonix-Workstations, a skilled adversary could correlate the various running Whonix-Workstations to the same pseudonym.

* An adversary could stress either/and CPU, HDD, RAM, network connection and other Whonix-Workstations. It is possible the host could be negatively affected as well.
* DDOSing: 
**Other Whonix-Workstations.
*** [[Non-Qubes-Whonix]]: There is no defense against DOSing other Whonix-Workstations.
*** [[Qubes-Whonix]]: Not applicable.
**Whonix-Gateway 
***There is no defense.
* Exploits:
** This risk can be reduced by following the recommendations found in the System Hardening Checklist.
** The adversary could try to exploit the Whonix-Gateway.
** The adversary could try to exploit other Whonix-Workstations.
*** Non-Qubes-Whonix: Applies
*** Qubes-Whonix: Not applicable. [Unless Whonix-Gateway is compromised first.] (Details in chapter [[#Firewall]].)
* Workstation-Firewall:
** Non-Qubes-Whonix: Whonix-Workstation provides an optional, disabled by default (because it can get into the way for other tasks) firewall, that can prevent different Whonix-Workstations from connecting to each other. (See [[Whonix-Workstation_Firewall|Whonix-Workstation Firewall]].) (Will be enabled by default in Whonix 14.)
** Qubes-Whonix: Not required. (Details in chapter [[#Firewall]].)
* Impersonating
** Non-Qubes-Whonix: A defense against impersonating (i.e. MITM or malicious gateway) other Whonix-Workstations or the Whonix-Gateway can be implemented using authentication, this is linked in the [[#How to use more than one Whonix-Workstation - More Security]] section below.
** Qubes-Whonix: Not required. (Details in chapter [[#Firewall]].)
* Identity correlation through circuit sharing <ref>See [[Stream Isolation]] page for definition.</ref>
** Non-Qubes-Whonix: Is not at risk as long as the Whonix-Workstations aren't compromised. Multiple Whonix-Workstations using different internal IPs (as recommended in the instructions below) are automatically using [[Stream Isolation]].<ref>Because [https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en IsolateClientAddr] is Tor's default.</ref>
** Qubes-Whonix: Not required. (Details in chapter [[#Firewall]].)

'''Setting up additional Whonix-Workstations with [[Qubes|Qubes-Whonix]]'''

Using multiple Whonix-Workstations within [[Qubes|Qubes-Whonix]] is a simple process. To do this users can create an additional AppVM based upon the Whonix-Workstation template (commonly called <code>whonix-ws</code>) with its own distinctive name. After the new AppVM is created ensure that it uses <code>sys-whonix</code> as its NetVM.

To create a new AppVM users need only follow this link for step-by-step instructions: [[Qubes/Create_Workstation_AppVMs|Create Whonix Workstation AppVMs]].

'''Setting up additional Whonix-Workstations with download/default Whonix-Workstations'''

{{Non-Qubes-Whonix}} Only!

Note: The following instructions only apply for Download/Default-Whonix-Workstations or if you build it yourself from source code.  If you would like to use an operating systems such as Windows, other Linux, BSD etc. please see the [[Other Operating Systems]] chapter instead.

Each additional Whonix-Workstation VM that is set up requires its own MAC address and internal LAN IP address. 

1. Clone a fresh Whonix-Workstation VM. 

VirtualBox

In VirtualBox Manager clone a clean Whonix-Workstation.   

KVM

In Virtual Machine Manager clone a clean Whonix-Workstation. 

Highlight Whonix-Workstation -> Open -> Virtual Machine -> Clone

2. Assign a new MAC address to the cloned VM.
 
Note: A new MAC address is also required if the additional VirtualBox VM is imported. 

VirtualBox

In VirtualBox Manager assign a new MAC address:

VirtualBox -> Settings -> Network -> Adapter 1 -> Advanced -> Mac Address ->
Create a new MAC address (press the green round arrow icon) -> Ok.

KVM

To change the internal network in KVM. See: [[KVM#Creating_Multiple_Internal_Networks|Creating Multiple Internal Networks]]

3. In Whonix-Workstation. {{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/network/interfaces.d/30_non-qubes-whonix
}}

Change the last octet. For example 10.152.152.11 to 10.152.152.12

4. Save and Exit.

5. In Whonix-Workstation, reboot. Or alternately restart the network.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo service networking restart
}}

6. Done.

= Multiple Whonix-Gateways =
==== Introduction ====
'''Advanced users only.'''

Multiple Whonix-Gateways can be used along side multiple Whonix-Workstations. However, this has both advantages and disadvantages. This set up is more secure since the Whonix-Gateway VMs are isolated from each other. In the event that one Whonix-Gateway is compromised, it is not certain the others will be compromised as well. However, the newly cloned Whonix-Gateways will end up with a different set of Tor entry guards, unless you take precautions.<ref>Such as manually sharing your entry guards. Qube-Whonix users can copy the Tor state folder to another sys-whonix (Non-Qubes-Whonix no documentation ever written to my knowledge) or using the same [[Bridges]]</ref>. Your ISP could guess that you are using two different Tor data folders, for whatever that's worth. (If you are using multiple Tor Browsers, you end up with different sets of Tor entry guards as well.)

Note: Multiple Whonix-Gateways are easier to manage and more secure when a single Whonix-Gateway is used at at time.

==== Qubes-Whonix ====
'''Setting up additional Whonix-Gateways (commonly called <sys-whonix) with [[Qubes|Qubes-Whonix]]'''

The only requirement for a newly created <code>sys-whonix</code> is it must be based on whonix-gw TemplateVM and <u>given a distinctive VM name</u>.

Create a new <code>sys-whonix</code> VM. 

Users can create a new sys-whonix ProxyVM by following the step-by-step directions: [[Qubes/Create_Gateway_ProxyVMs| Create Gateway ProxyVMs]].

===== VirtualBox =====
In this case, you also have to change Whonix-Gateway network interface2 and Whonix-Workstation network interface1 from internal network "Whonix" to something else.

===== KVM =====

See [[KVM#Multiple_Whonix-Gateways|Multiple Whonix-Gateways]].

Multiple Qubes-Whonix TemplateVMs 

Multiple Qubes-Whonix TemplateVMs provides much greater flexibility over a single template when choosing software packages. The additional cloned templates can be customized with software to meet specific requirements which would not be possible if a single TemplateVM was used.

Packages from a later release - Installing packages from a later release could end up breaking the system. For example, mixing packages from Debian Stable with those from a later release like Debian Testing can lead to a destabilized system due to associated software dependencies required for full functionality. Prior to installing Debian packages from a later release, first read #Install from Debian testing.

Custom software - With additional cloned templates users can install custom software used for a specific application. For example, users can Tunnel UDP over Tor by configuring whonix-ws to route all applications through a VPN tunnel. However, this method has the disadvantage of increasing the risk of identity correlation. To limit this risk, the AppVM based on this template should only be used for the particular application that a users needs to route through the tunnel-link.  Before installing custom software users are encouraged to read Install Software General Advice 

Untrusted packages -  Users should not install untrusted packages in a template used for sensitive activities. With multiple cloned TemplateVMs, a single template can be designated as a less trusted domain in which to install those packages. Read Notes on trusting your TemplateVM(s) prior to installing untrusted packages.     

Cloning TemplateVMs 

Note: Each TemplatesVM's root filesystem runs independently from all other TemplateVMs. This requires users to update each TemplateVM seperatly from all other TemplatesVMs

Cloning templates in Qubes-Whonix is a simple and process that can be accomplished by using Qubes Manager. However, care should be excersized when choosing names for both TemplateVMs and the AppVM based on those templates. The newly cloned TemplateVMs should be given names that are not easily confused for other TemplatesVMs. This will minimize the chances of a user basing an AppVM on the wrong template. When creating AppVMs based on cloned TemplateVMs, a purpose-based naming convention should be used so there is no ambiguity as to the intended use of an AppVM. For example, if an AppVM is created to tunnel UDP over Tor, users would append tunnel-udp (the purpose) to the end of anon-whonix which would create the name anon-whonix-tunnel-udp. 

Cloning Qubes-Whonix TemplateVMs is very easy and can be done using Qubes Manager.
