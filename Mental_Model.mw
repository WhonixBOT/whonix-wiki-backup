For computer security it is crucial to have a rough overview mental model on how the computer works on a technical level that approximates how the computer is really technically functioning.

A lot of program code from various sources runs on the computer. Some from necessarily trusted <ref name=trusted>
Trusted because one has to. No trusted because one wants to trust.
</ref> vendors. Other from less trusted or untrusted sources.

# When a computer is fully powered off, previously has had no battery and no power cord connected, when powering on the first thing that happens is the hardware initialization which is invisible to the user.
# The first visible thing the user can see during the boot process is the BIOS. It is an essential skill that the user can visually recognize the BIOS.
# The next thing the user can see is the bootloader such as for example grub on Linux.
# Skipping intermediary steps <ref>
On Linux such as kernel initialization, initramfs or dracut, systemd, single user mode.
</ref> the next thing the most users will usually see is the operating system desktop environment.
# The hardware, BIOS is ultimately trusted. <ref name=trusted />
# The operating system is highly trusted. <ref name=trusted /> <ref>
Unless there is hardware, firmware or BIOS level malware it is always possible to replace a compromised operating system with a clean operating system.

# Less trusted are applications such as web browsers for example, Firefox, Chrome or Tor Browser.
# Least trusted are contents shows by applications such as a website in a web browser.

Therefore it is important to know which program code (application or program) usually<ref>

The following image is legitimate.

The following image is an example of a '''scam'''. It is showing the Windows operating system running the Internet Explorer application viewing the systembrowsing.com website.

With the proper mental mental the <code>systembrowsing.com</code> is easily detected. That is, because <code>systembrowsing.com</code> is just a website inside the browser window. In most cases

It is important to mentally box the different parts.

* operating system: <code>Windows</code>
* application: <code>Internet Explorer</code>
* website: <code>systembrowsing.com</code> ('''scam''')

The image must not be viewed as a unified whole. While users must trust their operating system and less so their application, they must be absolutely skeptical about everything any website is saying.

Users who do not understand this concept remain highly vulnerable to all sorts of scams.

Learning about the concepts documented on related wiki pages [[Social_Engineering|Social Engineering and (Spear) Phishing]], [[Hardware Wallet Security|Cryptocurrency Hardware Wallet: Threat Model]] and [[login spoofing]] might also deepen understanding of this topic.

When rebooting it is in theory not guaranteed that one will see the real BIOS. It is possible that the user is only presented a fake reboot, i.e. the real operating system keeps running normally but shows a graphical simulation of a full reboot sequence. There is no confirmation that this technique has ever been deployed in practice.
