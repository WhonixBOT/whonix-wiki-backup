Open Source does not automagically prevent [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_%28computing%29 backdoors], unless the user creates its own binaries from source code itself. The ones who compile, upload and distribute (also the webhost) the binaries could add a {{Code2|hidden code}} without publishing the backdoor code. Nothing prevents one to claim, that a certain binary has been built from a clean source code, while the binary was actually built by the source code plus the backdoor code. Also the ones who may have infected the build machine with a backdoor are in position to add a backdoor without the distributor being aware of it.

Deterministic builds can detect backdoors. For more information on deterministic builds and why this is important, see:

A [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_(computing) backdoor] can either be a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computing) vulnerability] as in a bug in the source code. Vulnerabilities can get introduced by accident (human error) or on purpose. Once the software has been deployed and the vulnerability has been found, it might happen, that an attacker uses an [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploit_(computer_security) exploits] to gain unauthorized access. [http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/42318/hiding-backdoors-in-open-source-code-in-other-languages-than-c-and-c Such vulnerabilities (or purposely planted backdoors) can, with cleverness, be planted in Open Source code plain sight, while being very difficult and unlikely to be spotted by people looking at the code.] Examples:

* [https://lwn.net/Articles/57135/ An attempt to backdoor the kernel].
* Some argued, the [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/05/21/massive_debian_openssl_hangover/ Debian SSL debacle], wasn't a bug, but a backdoor (no one has spot vulnerability in the source code for years!).

Another form of a backdoor is adding the full code (or binary) of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_(computing) trojan horse] (computer virus) to the binary build, while not publishing the extra source code and keeping that secret code. The latter, can only be detected with {{Code2|Deterministic Builds}}, which are discussed above.
<br />
Therefore it is impossible to claim that non-trivial source code is backdoor free, because a backdoors can be hidden as vulnerabilities. Auditors scrutinizing the source code can only state their opinion about the quality of the source code and eventually report a vulnerability. It can only be reasonably easily checked, if the source code is free of computer viruses (for example, trojan horses), not backdoors.

= Attacks =

== Circumventing Proxy Obedience Design ==
Knowledge assumed:

* [[Comparison of different Whonix variants]].
* Unsafe Browser: Tails and Liberte Linux contain a so called Unsafe Browser. The Unsafe Browser does not use Tor. Connects in the clear. It is useful to register on hotspots or to view content in the clear without Tor.
* Exploit against physically isolated Whonix-Gateway: difficult against a bare metal physical isolated Whonix-Gateway. This is because Whonix-Workstation can only access Tor running on Whonix-Gateway. We minimized attack surface, hardening etc. See the whole Security and Hardening page for details.
* TBB stands for Tor Browser Bundle.
* In the following table,
** "{{Code2|Fail}}" is defined as "IP/location of user is compromised.".
** "{{Code2|Safe}}" is defined as "IP/location of user is hidden behind Tor.".

Whonix protects against IP/location discovery through root exploits ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware Malware] with root rights) on the Workstation <ref name=workstation />. This does not mean, risk to get infected with malware. Do not! It would still make all data inside Whonix-Workstation available to the attacker. Like said at other places as well, Whonix is not a perfect system. It can not be. Whonix is not unbreakable. What Whonix does, it higher the effort for an attacker to find out the user's real IP address, thus de-anonymizing the user. The following table shall visualize the various defense layers provided by Whonix.

= Conclusion =
Different threat model, different implementation, different use cases, although some overlap. Different political and design decisions.

= Statement about Neutrality of this Page =
== General ==
It is difficult to make an 100% neutral comparison, if the main contributors to this page, are mostly Whonix users. We still believe, having this non-perfect page is better than having no such page. Please also keep in mind, that this page also could have been anonymously posted elsewhere (Wikipedia?). The contributors to this page decided to attach their pseudonyms.

We allow anonymous edits, those are usually we approve edits within a short time. Should anything still be wrong, feel free to edit it right away. The whole article is under a Free (as in speech) license, under GPLv3+, so if anyone is interested to edit this page to a more neutral place (such as Wikipedia?), adrelanos would be fine with that. Adrelanos would also agree to dual/multi/re-licensing this page under a different Free (as in speech) license (such as GFDL or so), should that be required. Ironically, moving the article to Wikipedia wouldn't work so well (adrelanos would still be fine with that!), since Wikipedia does not allow edits made by Tor users, and most people interested in this article, are Tor users.

== Different views ==
One has always to be very careful, when talking about others. Especially, when talking about advantages and disadvantages. Different opinions are accepted and listed here.
