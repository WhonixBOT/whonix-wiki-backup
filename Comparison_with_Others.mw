= Introduction =

This page contains the comparisons of Whonix, Tails, Tor Browser and Qubes OS TorVM. If anything here is incorrect or becomes outdated feel free to edit this page or [[contact]] us, we'll correct as soon as possible.

'''Last update'''

Comparing:

* Whonix 0.4.5
* Tails 0.16.
* Qubes OS TorVM 0.1.beta1

Legend:

* ? - ''Status currently not researched.'' Help filling the gaps is welcome.

= Different views =

One has always to be very careful, when talking about others. Especially, when talking about advantages and disadvantages. Different opinions are accepted and listed here.

= Attacks =

== Circumventing Proxy Obedience Design ==

Knowledge assumed:

* [[Comparison of different Whonix variants]].
* Unsafe Browser: Tails and Liberte Linux contain a so called Unsafe Browser. The Unsafe Browser does not use Tor. Connects in the clear. It is useful to register on hotspots or to view content in the clear without Tor.
* Exploit against physically isolated Whonix-Gateway: difficult against a bare metal physical isolated Whonix-Gateway. This is because Whonix-Workstation can only access Tor running on Whonix-Gateway. We minimized attack surface, hardening etc. See the whole Security and Hardening page for details.
* TBB stands for Tor Browser Bundle.
* In the following table,
** "fail" is defined as "IP/location of user is compromised.".
** "safe" is defined as "IP/location of user is hidden behind Tor.".

Whonix protects against IP/location discovery through root exploits ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware Malware] with root rights) on the Workstation <ref name=workstation />. This does not mean, risk to get infected with malware. Do not! It would still make all data inside Whonix-Workstation available to the attacker. Like said at other places as well, Whonix is not a perfect system. It can not be. Whonix is not unbreakable. What Whonix does, it higher the effort for an attacker to find out the user's real IP address, thus de-anonymizing the user. The following table shall visualize the various defense layers provided by Whonix.
