= Comparison of Whonix, Tails, Tor Browser Bundle and Qubes OS TorVM =

== Introduction ==

Quick comparison of Whonix and Tails key virtues. If ever anything in this table is incorrect/outdated feel free to contact Whonix developers, we'll correct as fast as possible.

'''Last update'''

Comparing:

* Whonix 0.4.5
* Tails 0.16.
* Qubes OS TorVM 0.1.beta1

Legend:

* ? - ''Status currently not researched by adrelanos.'' Help filling the gaps is welcome.

== Different views ==

One has always to be very careful, when talking about others. Especially, when talking about advantages and disadvantages. Different opinions are accepted and listed here.

<sup>1</sup> [[OtherOperatingSystems|Custom-Workstation]]: self made builds can run on any real or virtual hardware as long as they are behind a Whonix-Gateway. Tor Browser binaries are only available for a limited amount of platforms (Windows, Linux, BSD, Mac).

<sup>2</sup> Whonix-Workstation: also [[Other Operating Systems]] are supported.; Whonix-Gateway: In long term we are also agnostic about any other secure distributions. The concept is agnostic, you could use another operating system as base, but it requires effort.

<sup>3</sup> Default downloads are for Virtual Box. (Subject for change in future.) [[PhysicalIsolation]] is an security optional feature for advancend users. Experimental optional support for [[VMware]]. You can build your own images for other virtualizers, but it requires effort.

<sup>4</sup> See [[Other Operating Systems]].

<sup>5</sup> You can install your host operating system on USB.

<sup>6</sup> You can download files and keep them, save bookmarks and passwords depending on your settings. 

<sup>7</sup> Whonix has no nice USB installer. Installing operating system on USB is recommend and left to the user.

<sup>8</sup> Tails has a nice USB installer.

<sup>a</sup> Whonix has Protection against IP/location discovery through root exploits ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware Malware] with root rights) inside Whonix-Workstation. But you really should not test it. In case Whonix-Workstation gets rooted, the adversary can not find out the users real IP/location. This is because Whonix-Workstation can only connect through the Whonix-Gateway. How difficult is it to compromise Whonix? See [[Comparison with Others/#attacks|Attack on Whonix]] and [[Design]]. More skill is required.

<sup>1</sup> Such kinds of leaks are impossible <sup>a</sup> in Whonix, since the Whonix-Workstation is unaware of it's external IP.

<sup>2</sup> In case Tails or TBB gets rooted, the adversary can simply bypass the firewall and get the user's real IP.

<sup>5</sup> See first example of [[Security in Real World|Whonix security in real world]]. When applications in Tails are configured wrong, due to a bug in Tails or the application, IP can leak. Quoted from the [https://tails.boum.org/security/index.en.html Tails Security Page]: ''"Until an [https://tails.boum.org/todo/applications_audit/ audit] of the bundled network applications is done, information leakages at the protocol level should be considered as - at the very least - possible."''

<sup>6</sup> There are no special measures to limit what is written to disk. This includes (non exclusive list) user created files, backup files, temporary files, swap, chat history, browser history and so on. Whonix acts like an ordinary installed operating system. It can also not be prevented, that the host memory [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swap swaps] to the host disk. There is a [[Security Guide/#recommendation-to-use-multiple-vm-snapshots|Recommendation to use multiple VM Snapshots]] and it is is [[Advanced Security Guide/#full-disk-encryption|recommend]] to apply Full Disk Encryption on the host. This is the price, Whonix has to pay, because many features could be more easily added to Whonix by adrelanos or can be easily installed by the user.

<sup>7</sup> Done by design.

<sup>8</sup> See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_boot_attack Cold boot attack].

<sup>12</sup> Although it does not try to store to disk, swap can still leak.

<sup>13</sup> [https://tails.boum.org/todo/separate_Tor_streams/ Tails separate Tor streams]

<sup>14</sup> [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3455 Tor Browser should set SOCKS username for a request based on referer]

<sup>15</sup> Tor Browser comes with it's own Tor instance. It's just a browser, not a live system or operating system.

<sup>16</sup> See [[Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection]] for details.

<sup>17</sup> By default there get of course not send to anyone. This is only at risk in case the machine gets compromised by malware. See also, [https://tails.boum.org/forum/Are_hardware_serial_numbers_hidden_in_TAILS__63__/ Are hardware serial numbers hidden in TAILS?]. 

<sup>18</sup> The Workstation is the place where the browser, IRC client and so on is running. The Gateway is the place where Tor and the firewall is running.

<sup>19</sup> It is in the nature of the MAC addresses, that destination servers can not see them. Therefore yes, always hidden from destination servers.

<sup>20</sup> Most ISPs do not see the MAC addresses of their clients. Some ISPs are based on LANs, in that case they can see the MAC address. Also hotspots can see the MAC address.

<sup>21</sup> Please read [[broken|Whonix in public networks / MAC Address]].

<sup>22</sup> [https://tails.boum.org/todo/macchanger/ Tails Todo: machanger]

<sup>23</sup> Placeholder.

<sup>24</sup> The virtual MAC address of Whonix-Workstation and Whonix-Gateway

<sup>25</sup> is shared among all Whonix users. If any (malicious) applications would spill it 

<sup>26</sup>, it would only be known that it's from a Whonix user.

<sup>25</sup> The virtual MAC address for Whonix-Gateway's internal network interface (eth1) is shared among all Whonix users, because Whonix-Workstation can see it. However, Whonix-Workstation can not see Whonix-Gateway's external network cards (eth0) MAC address.

<sup>26</sup> Which they usually won't do. Sometimes anti cheat or copyright protection tools do it.

<sup>32</sup> Live DVD without persistent USB storage for the Tor data directory.

<sup>33</sup> Whonix users might tend to have more traffic than TBB users, due to operating system updates of Whonix-Workstation and Whonix-Gateway through Tor. Unknown if this is specific enough to guess a transparent or isolating proxy is being used or if enough other Tor users run big enough amounts of traffic through Tor. Research before Whonix was created has shown that big amounts of filesharing traffic were run through Tor. Classical filesharing tends to have more upload than Whonix, but it's also unknown how many people disabled upload or moved to methods which do not involve much upload, such as file hosters. 

<sup>34</sup> Quoted from the [https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/Time_syncing/#index5h1 Tails Design about Time syncing]: "''Our initial time guess based on the Tor consensus is probably easier to fingerprint, though: a fresh Tor is started, and restarted again right after the consensus has been downloaded.''"

<sup>35</sup> Unsafe Browser: Tails and Liberte Linux contain a so called Unsafe Browser. The Unsafe Browser does not use Tor. Connects in the clear. It is useful to register on hotspots or to view content in the clear without Tor.

<sup>37</sup> When using VMs: The unsafe browser on the host is untouched. It does not get any better or worse by installing Whonix.; When using Physical Isolation: As in Whonix 0.5.6 there is no unsafe browser. A separate third machine with clearnet access could be used.

=== Flash / Browser Plugin security ===

'''Note''': Whonix developer adrelanos recommend due to anonymity, privacy and security issues against using Adobe Flash when anonymity is the goal. As far I know, Tails and Tor developers recommend against it as well.

== Attacks ==

=== Circumventing Proxy Obedience Design ===

Knowledge assumed:

* [[Comparison of different Whonix variants]].
* Unsafe Browser: Tails and Liberte Linux contain a so called Unsafe Browser. The Unsafe Browser does not use Tor. Connects in the clear. It is useful to register on hotspots or to view content in the clear without Tor.
* Exploit against physically isolated Whonix-Gateway: difficult against a bare metal physical isolated Whonix-Gateway. This is because Whonix-Workstation can only access Tor running on Whonix-Gateway. We minimized attack surface, hardening etc. See the whole Security and Hardening page for details.
* TBB stands for Tor Browser Bundle.
* In the following table,
** "fail" is defined as "IP/location of user is compromised.".
** "safe" is defined as "IP/location of user is hidden behind Tor.".
* The numbers (1) to (10) are used to numerate various attacks. Those attacks are described in more details below.

Whonix protects against IP/location discovery through root exploits ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware Malware] with root rights) on the Workstation<sup>1</sup>. This does not mean, risk to get infected with malware. Do not! It would still make all data inside Whonix-Workstation available to the attacker. Like said at other places as well, Whonix is not a perfect system. It can not be. Whonix is not unbreakable. What Whonix does, it higher the effort for an attacker to find out the user's real IP address, thus de-anonymizing the user. The following table shall visualize the various defense layers provided by Whonix.

<sup>1</sup> The Workstation is the place where the browser, IRC client and so on is running. The Gateway is the place where Tor and the firewall is running.

# An application doesn't honor proxy settings. Example: [https://blog.torproject.org/blog/firefox-security-bug-proxy-bypass-current-tbbs Tor Browser Bundle: Firefox security bug (proxy-bypass)].
# For example proxy bypass bugs, where the application spills the users real IP. See [[Security in Real World|Whonix security in real world]], for examples where Whonix circumvented them. It gets circumvented by Whonix because Whonix-Workstation does not know the users real IP address.
# Example: user visits a website over Tor with a torified Browser. The website uses known or zero day vulnerability to gain remote code execution on the users machine. Remote cod execution is used to install malware on the users machine. The used vulnerability allows the adversary to get "only" user rights, not root. The adversary could remotely start the Unsafe Browser and therefore find out the users real IP address. This attack gets circumvented by Whonix, because any applications inside Whonix, including malware, can only connect through Tor.
# Example: user visits a website over Tor with a torified Browser. The website uses known or zero day vulnerability to gain remote code execution on the users machine. Remote cod execution is used to install malware on the users machine. The used vulnerability allows the adversary to get "only" user rights, not root. The adversary gains root through escalate privileges using a second vulnerability. This allows the adversary to tamper with iptables rules, to make non-Tor connections and so on. This attack gets circumvented by Whonix, because Whonix's Firewall runs on another (virtual) machine. This attack gets circumvented by Whonix, because any root applications inside Whonix, including malware with root rights, can only connect through Tor.

Whonix Standard Download version host+vm+vm is broken against this attack. Whonix Physical Isolation defeats this attack, because the Whonix-Workstation's host does not know it's real IP address, only Whonix-Gateway, running on an other physical machine knows it.
# Same as attack (5). But the adversary uses an extra vulnerability to break into Whonix-Gateway. Whonix is broken against this attack.

<sup>2</sup> Unless you are using Multiple Gateways. (Optional Whonix feature in progress.)

<sup>3</sup> Whonix defeats some attacks against Tor (and components such as Tor Browser), for example, see [[TimeSync|Whonix's Secure And Distributed Time Synchronization Mechanism]] and [[Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection]] and the rest of the Security and Hardening page.

<sup>1</sup> This is important because otherwise non-anonymous activity could be linked to anonymous activity if the clock skew is too big and/or too unique.

<sup>2</sup> Because unsafe browser runs on the VM host (NTP) and torified browser runs inside Whonix-Workstation. (tails_htp)

<sup>3</sup> Whonix-Workstation (tails_htp) and Whonix-Gateway (separate tails_htp) time differ. 

<sup>4</sup> VM host time gets synchronized with NTP and VM time gets synchronized with tails_htp. 

<sup>5</sup> Untorified host browser uses the same clock as TBB.

<sup>6</sup> Host and VM clock both get synchronized with NTP, but it could still make a difference, because they are synchronized independently.

<sup>7</sup> Assumed an installed regular operating system using NTP was used earlier and the adversary introduced a clock skew.

<sup>8</sup> Introduced by ISP level adversary attack.

<sup>9</sup> Due to unique clock skew.

<sup>10</sup> Unsafe browser and torified browser share the same clock. (tails_htp)

<sup>11</sup> VM Host time gets synchronized with NTP and operating system time gets synchronized with tails_htp.

<sup>12</sup> Such as running tordate.

<sup>1</sup> To do it safely.

<sup>2</sup> Easy: In Whonix one could also install an [https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea Tor-unsafe] BitTorrent client. In worst case it would be pseudonymous (IP still hidden) rather than anonymous.

<sup>3</sup> Medium: Tails has a firewall to block non-Tor traffic, but an [https://tails.boum.org/todo/applications_audit/ audit] at protocol level is still required. Quoted from the [https://tails.boum.org/security/index.en.html Tails Security Page]: ''"Until an [https://tails.boum.org/todo/applications_audit/ audit] of the bundled network applications is done, information leakages at the protocol level should be considered as ? at the very least ? possible."'' 

<sup>4</sup> Hard: It's left to the user to prevent non-Tor traffic, DNS leaks and protocol level leaks. 

<sup>5</sup> Text, screenshot or video instructions [[Download/#install-whonix available]].

<sup>6</sup> This and the whole documentation will be improved in next Whonix version.

<sup>7</sup> Examples what not to do: [[DoNot]].
