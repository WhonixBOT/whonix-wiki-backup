This page contains a detailed comparison of {{project_name}}, Tails, Tor Browser, Qubes OS TorVM and corridor.
= Introduction =
Although Qubes' TorVM -- a dedicated ProxyVM providing torified networking to all clients -- is [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/torvm/ now deprecated], it has been kept for comparison purposes since it acted like {{gateway_product_name}} (<code>sys-whonix</code>). <ref>
The Qubes website states:

<blockquote>
If you are interested in TorVM, you will find the {{project name}} implementation in Qubes a more usable and robust solution for creating a torifying traffic proxy.
</blockquote>

Having SSL supported mirrors may seem like an oxymoron. The common practice is to assume that mirrors are not to be trusted. Even if the mirror owners were trusted persons, it is still an open question how good their server security is. Even if their server security is exceptional, mirrors are generally also hosted in hosting companies and we cannot trust those. However, not all adversaries have extensive capabilities like being capable of mounting man-in-the-middle attacks, breaking server security or forcing the hosting company to turn over the keys and so on. Users who do not use verification are still better off downloading from a SSL supported mirror. Therefore, SSL protected mirrors work well against less sophisticated adversaries. In terms of numbers, this results in fewer users potentially ending up with maliciously altered downloads.

It would also be safer if the download server was under the full control of the developers and not under control of a company, the hosting provider. Unfortunately that is not how things work today. Self-hosting is very expensive, requires a fast internet connection (home user contracts are not fast enough), and adequate physical security. Even the servers of The Tor Project are not hosted in a developer's home.

== Circumventing Proxy Obedience Design ==

=== Introduction ===

This section presupposes the user is familiar with:

* The [[Comparison of different {{project name short}} variants|security comparison of different {{project name}} variants]].
* Unsafe Browser: Tails and Liberte Linux package a so-called "Unsafe Browser". The Unsafe Browser does not use Tor, but instead connects in the clear. It is useful for hotspot registration or for viewing clearnet content without Tor.
* Feasible exploits against a physically isolated {{gateway_product_name}}: this is difficult when the {{gateway_product_name}} is running in a bare metal configuration. The reason is that only {{workstation_product_name}} has access to Tor running on {{gateway_product_name}}. <ref>{{project_name}} developers have also minimized the attack surface, added hardening features and so on. Refer to developer documentation on security and hardening for further details.</ref>

{{project_name}} protects against discovery of a user's IP address / location via a successful root exploit ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware Malware] with root rights) on the {{workstation_product_name}} (<code>anon-whonix</code>). <ref name=workstation /> Users should not deliberately test this feature and risk becoming infected with malware, since all the data inside {{workstation_product_name}} (<code>anon-whonix</code>) would become available to the attacker. 

{{project_name}} is not a perfect or unbreakable system, nor can it ever be. However, {{project name}} does raise the bar for attackers, meaning greater effort and skill is needed to discover the user's real IP address and successfully deanonymize them. The following table summarizes the defense-in-depth provided by the {{project name}} design.

Terms that are used in the following table are defined below: 

* <u>TBB:</u> Tor Browser Bundle.
* <u>Fail:</u> the IP address / location of the user is compromised.
* <u>Safe:</u> the IP address / location of the user is hidden behind Tor.

== Network Time-related ==

=== Introduction ===

This section presupposes the user is familiar with:

* [[Dev/TimeSync|{{project_name}} Design: TimeSync]].
* [https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/Time_syncing/ Tails Design: Time syncing].

Terms that are used in the following table are defined below:

* <u>(VM host) update/crypto block:</u> prevention of (VM host) operating system updates and cryptographic verification such as TLS / SSL in the (VM host) browser.
* <u>u/c-block:</u> update/crypto block.
* <u>Tor blocked:</u> prevention of connections to the Tor network until the clock is manually fixed.
* <u>Big clock skew:</u> more than 1 hour in the past or more than 3 hours in the future. <ref name=source>Source: https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-February/023264.html</ref>
* <u>Small clock skew:</u> less than 1 hour in the past or less than 3 hours in the future. <ref name=source />

| Functional new identity option in Tor Button
| {{Yes}} <ref name=niasdebian>The option is just as effective as comparable platforms, like Debian.</ref>
| {{Yes}} <ref>
This option is fully functional in Tails, despite the quote below - see the additional footnote.

As noted on the Tails' website, https://tails.boum.org/doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser/index.en.html#new_identity:

<blockquote>
This feature is not enough to strongly [https://tails.boum.org/doc/about/warning/index.en.html#identities separate contextual identities] in the context of Tails as the connections outside of Tor Browser are not restarted.

Shutdown and restart Tails instead.

= Statement about Neutrality of this Page =

== General ==

An impartial comparison of anonymity platforms and tools is difficult, since contributors to this page are most likely {{project name}} users. Regardless, an imperfect comparison page is better than none at all. The reader should bear in mind that this wiki content might have been anonymously posted elsewhere, such as Wikipedia. The contributors to this page have decided to attach their pseudonyms.

Anonymous edits are allowed and are generally published within a short time frame. Readers who notice any mistakes can immediately edit the page. This entire article is published under a Free (as in speech) license (GPLv3+). <ref>Permission is granted by adrelanos (Patrick Schleizer) for anyone editing this page to shift the content to a more neutral place, like Wikipedia. Should it be required, Schleizer would also agree to dual / multi / re-licensing of this page under a different Free (as in speech) license, such as GFDL. Note that moving the article to Wikipedia is difficult to achieve anonymously, since they do not allow Tor user edits (and most people interested in this article are Tor users).</ref>

== Different Views ==

Opinions should always be expressed carefully, particularly when analyzing the merits and weaknesses of other software projects. A range of different opinions already exist on this exact issue. Interested readers can refer to the following resources or add their own:
