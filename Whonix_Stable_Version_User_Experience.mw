|description=User Experience Goals for the Stable Version of Whonix

}}

Goal: Using stable version of {{project_name}} should never run into situations/upgrades that destroy:

* connectivity
* graphical desktop
* apt-get
* or require manual fixes being applied.

Each stable version should be able to upgrade to the next stable version, at least within a month or so. That's why no complex changes are introduced into the stable version as this easily breaks things under unforeseeable conditions.
