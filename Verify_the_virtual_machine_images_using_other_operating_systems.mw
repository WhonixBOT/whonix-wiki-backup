|description=Instructions for OpenPGP Verification of Whonix using Other Operating Systems
}}

GnuPG, a common free software implementation of OpenPGP has versions and graphical frontends for both Windows and Mac OS X. This also make it possible to check the cryptographic signature with those operating systems:

[http://www.gpg4win.org/ Gpg4win], for Windows.

[http://www.gpgtools.org/ GPGTools], for Mac OS X. [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-August/029256.html Getting a GnuPG version for Windows in a secure way]

You will find on either of those websites detailed documentation on how to install and use them.

'''For Windows using Gpg4win'''

After installing Gpg4win, download the [[Whonix Signing Key]].

[http://www.gpg4win.org/doc/en/gpg4win-compendium_15.html Consult the Gpg4win documentation to import it]

Then, download the cryptographic signature corresponding to the virtual machine image you want to verify: <br />
[[Download#Whonix_signature|Whonix Signature]]

[http://www.gpg4win.org/doc/en/gpg4win-compendium_24.html#id4 Consult the Gpg4win documentation to check the signature]

If you see "{{Code2|Not enough information to check signature validity}}" as shown below.

[[File:Kleopatra_not_enough_information_to_check_signature_validity.png|400px]]

This warning equals.

<pre>
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
</pre>

See [[Verify_the_virtual_machine_images_using_the_command_line|TODO]] for explanation.

'''For Mac OS X using GPGTools'''

After installing GPGTools, you should be able to follow the instruction for [[Verify the virtual machine images using the command line|Linux with the command line]]. To open the command line, navigate to your Applications folder, open Utilities, and double click on Terminal.
