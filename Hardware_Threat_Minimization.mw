= Microphones =

| text       = Advanced adversaries already have specialized implant plug-ins which can [https://theintercept.com/2014/03/12/nsa-plans-infect-millions-computers-malware/ take over the computer's microphone] and record nearby conversations. <ref>The implant is called CAPTIVATEAUDIENCE, while the webcam equivalent is called GUMFISH.</ref> <ref>https://www.wired.com/2014/03/webcams-mics/</ref>
}}


== Eavesdropping Risk ==

The user should check whether the computer or notebook has a microphone. Microphones are often built-in and go unnoticed. In most cases it is recommended to disable the microphone for security reasons. If the Whonix-Workstation is ever compromised by malware, an adversary could eavesdrop through the microphone. <ref>One attack vector is the use of [https://theintercept.com/2014/03/12/nsa-plans-infect-millions-computers-malware/ spam emails which containing malware].</ref>

== Voice Recognition ==

It is safe to assume that everyone has had an unencrypted phone call during their lifetime and that one of them has been recorded. Voiceprints allow a person to be identified from the specific characteristics (acoustics) of their voice and it is a useful biometric marker. <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_recognition#Technology</ref> This means personal and unique voiceprints can be used to link non-anonymous and "anonymous" voice samples; a process called voice recognition and documented on the [[VoIP|VoIP]] wiki page in the introduction chapter. <ref>Writing styles are also personal and unique. Individuals can be identified with a similar method called [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylometry stylometry], which is documented on the [[Surfing_Posting_Blogging|Surfing Posting Blogging]] wiki page.</ref>

== Disabling or Removing Microphones ==

Unfortunately, by default microphones that are connected to the host are made available to virtual machines like Whonix-Workstation (except for Qubes-Whonix, see further below).

For the greatest security, external microphones should be unplugged. If the microphone is built-in and the user decides to disable it, there may be a BIOS option to achieve this. Suitably skilled users may also attempt to remove built-in microphones, although this is more difficult.

== Select Use of Microphones ==

[[Multiple_Whonix-Workstations|Multiple Whonix-Workstations]] should be used for: making internet calls, conducting [[Voip|Voice over IP (VoIP]]), or microphone use for other reasons inside Whonix-Workstation. In this way the microphone is used in selected, not all, Whonix-Workstations. Unplug the microphone after use.

For [[VoIP|VoIP]] purposes, audio passthrough capability may need to be enabled for the respective hypervisor. The following section documents how to get audio working on [[Download|supported platforms]].

The user should always check if their computer or notebook has a webcam. One might be built-in, but have gone unnoticed - check the computer's datasheet and operating system hardware manager to be sure.

It is recommended that webcams are disabled or removed, unless the user plans to use it inside Whonix-Workstation. If webcam use is planned, it should be disabled and possibly unplugged immediately after use. 

External webcams should also be unplugged for optimal security. If the webcam is built-in, the user should check whether it can be disabled with a BIOS setting. Suitably skilled users can attempt to remove built-in webcams, although this may be difficult. Alternatively, the webcam can be covered externally with adhesive tape or a cap.

= Wireless Input Devices =

Avoid using wireless keyboards and mice because most send data unencrypted. Even if this wasn't the case, there is no way to verify the robustness of the cryptography involved in proprietary products. A local adversary (up to 100 meters away) can sniff keystrokes and inject their own, allowing them to take over the machine.<ref>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/03/security_vulner_6.html</ref><ref>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/08/security_vulner_7.html</ref>
