== Eavesdropping Risk ==

It is recommended to check whether the computer or notebook has a microphone. Microphones are often built-in and go unnoticed. In most cases it is advisable to disable the microphone for security reasons. If {{workstation_product_name}} (<code>anon-whonix</code>) is ever compromised by malware, an adversary could eavesdrop through the microphone. <ref>One attack vector is the use of [https://theintercept.com/2014/03/12/nsa-plans-infect-millions-computers-malware/ spam emails which contain malware].</ref> Similarly, keyboard acoustic side channel attacks can use the audio leakage from keyboard typing to infer the words up to a certain degree of accuracy. <ref>https://fc16.ifca.ai/preproceedings/21_Anand.pdf</ref> <ref>Researchers continue to improve the accuracy of various techniques and attack vectors like feature extraction and classification, keyboard geometry and triangulation.</ref>

== Voice Recognition ==

It is safe to assume that everyone has had an unencrypted phone call during their lifetime and that one of them has been recorded. Voiceprints allow a person to be identified from the specific characteristics (acoustics) of their voice and it is a useful biometric marker. <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_recognition#Technology</ref> This means personal and unique voiceprints can be used to link non-anonymous and "anonymous" voice samples; a process called voice recognition and documented on the [[VoIP|VoIP]] wiki page in the introduction chapter. <ref>Writing styles are also personal and unique. Individuals can be identified with a similar method called [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylometry stylometry], which is documented on the [[Surfing_Posting_Blogging|Surfing Posting Blogging]] wiki page.</ref>

== Disabling or Removing Microphones ==

By default, microphones that are connected to the host are made available to virtual machines like {{workstation_product_name}} (except for [[{{q_project_name_short}}|{{q_project_name}}]], see further below).

For best security, external microphones should be unplugged. If the microphone is built-in and the user decides to disable it, there might be a BIOS option available. Suitably skilled users can also attempt to remove built-in microphones, although this is more difficult.

== Select Use of Microphones ==

[[Multiple_{{workstation_product_name_short}}|Multiple {{workstation_product_name}}]] should be used for: 

* Making Internet calls.
* Conducting [[Voip|Voice over IP (VoIP)]].
* Any other microphone use inside {{workstation_product_name}} (<code>anon-whonix</code>). 

In this way, the microphone is used in select {{workstation_product_name}}s and not all. The microphone should be unplugged after use.

For [[VoIP|VoIP]] purposes, audio pass-through capability may need to be enabled for the respective hypervisor. The following section documents how to get audio working on [[Download|supported platforms]].

[[VirtualBox]] has access to the host's microphone by default. Users can disable access by muting it on the host. Alternatively, from VirtualBox 5.2 there is an option to enable/disable VM guest access to the host's microphone. <ref>https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/12026</ref> 

When the VM is stopped, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
VBoxManage modifyvm <uuid{{!}}vmname> audioin off

Or when the VM is up and running, use.

{{CodeSelect|code=

= Webcams =

| text       = Webcams pose a serious [https://www.wired.com/2014/03/webcams-mics/ spying] [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/27/gchq-nsa-webcam-images-internet-yahoo risk]! 
}}


Webcams on infected machines can be used to take snapshots, record video or eavesdrop using the built-in microphone. [https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/08/researchers-find-way-to-spy-on-remote-screens-through-the-webcam-mic/ Recent research] reveals that even remote screen views can be accurately determined via webcams, due to "content-dependent acoustic leakage from LCD screens." <ref>This is a novel acoustic side-channel attack variant that relies on neural networks and the "coil whine" audio emissions from electronic components that power the LCD display.</ref>

Always check if the computer or notebook has a webcam; one might be built-in, but have gone unnoticed. Check the computer's datasheet and operating system hardware manager to be sure. It is recommended that (external) webcams are disabled or removed, unless there are immediate plans to use it inside {{workstation_product_name}} (<code>anon-whonix</code>). Once a webcam session has finished, it should be disabled and preferably unplugged straight away. 

If the webcam is built-in, check whether it can be disabled with a BIOS setting. Suitably skilled users can attempt to remove built-in webcams, although this may be difficult. As a stop-gap measure, the webcam can always be covered with thick adhesive tape or a cap, so long as it is opaque.

= Wireless Input Devices =

Avoid using wireless keyboards and mice because most send data unencrypted. Even if this was not the case, the robustness of the cryptography involved in proprietary products cannot be verified. A local adversary up to 100 meters away can sniff keystrokes and inject their own, allowing them to take over the machine.<ref>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/03/security_vulner_6.html</ref> <ref>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/08/security_vulner_7.html</ref>
