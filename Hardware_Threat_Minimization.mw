== Eavesdropping Risk ==

It is recommended to check whether the computer or notebook has a microphone. Microphones are often built-in and go unnoticed. In most cases it is advisable to disable the microphone for security reasons. If {{workstation_product_name}} (<code>anon-whonix</code>) is ever compromised by malware, an adversary could eavesdrop through the microphone. <ref>One attack vector is the use of [https://theintercept.com/2014/03/12/nsa-plans-infect-millions-computers-malware/ spam emails which contain malware].</ref> Similarly, keyboard acoustic side channel attacks can use the audio leakage from keyboard typing to infer the words up to a certain degree of accuracy. <ref>https://fc16.ifca.ai/preproceedings/21_Anand.pdf</ref> <ref>Researchers continue to improve the accuracy of various techniques and attack vectors like feature extraction and classification, keyboard geometry and triangulation.</ref> This also applies to touch screen devices like smartphones and tablets.<ref>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/04/recovering_smar.html</ref>

The attack paper "SPEAKE(a)R: Turn Speakers to Microphones for Fun and Profit"<ref>https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1611/1611.07350.pdf</ref> does not apply to VMs. While virtual sound devices might be retaskable with software too, the malware still cannot access the soundcard settings of the host to retask it also, assuming no VM escape. Replies from the QEMU devs confirm the conclusion that no risk posed to host. Also virtual soundcards optionally have half-duplex modes that make audio input impossible. <ref>https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2016-11/msg04754.html2</ref><ref>https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2016-11/msg04899.html2</ref><ref>https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2016-11/msg04906.html2</ref><ref>https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2016-11/msg04904.html2</ref>

A mechanical HDD's maliciously modified firmware is able to record PES data that registers minute disturbances in the platter. Sounds can be reconstructed from this info. Human speech is enough to show up in the PES data. Limitations: 1) An attacker needs to physcially amper with your equipment which is possible if tey interdict it during shipping. 2) Sounds near the hard drive need to be rather loud. For human speech, that's 75dB minimum, almost-argument level noise within few feet of the hard drive. To ID music, it needs to be playing at about 90dB. As loud as a lawnmower.<ref>https://www.extremetech.com/electronics/287324-researchers-turn-hard-drives-into-covert-listening-devices</ref> Note that this doesn't apply to VMs where disk devices are emulated. The alternative of using a SSD has the drawback of uncertainty when it comes to deleting encrypted volume headers or changing encryption passphrases.

== Voice Recognition ==

It is safe to assume that everyone has had an unencrypted phone call during their lifetime and that one of them has been recorded. Voiceprints allow a person to be identified from the specific characteristics (acoustics) of their voice and it is a useful biometric marker. <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_recognition#Technology</ref> This means personal and unique voiceprints can be used to link non-anonymous and "anonymous" voice samples; a process called voice recognition and documented on the [[VoIP|VoIP]] wiki page in the introduction chapter. <ref>Writing styles are also personal and unique. Individuals can be identified with a similar method called [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylometry stylometry], which is documented on the [[Surfing_Posting_Blogging|Surfing Posting Blogging]] wiki page.</ref>

== Disabling or Removing Microphones ==

By default, microphones that are connected to the host are made available to virtual machines like {{workstation_product_name}} (except for {{project_name}} KVM on Buster hosts and [[{{q_project_name_short}}|{{q_project_name}}]], see further below).

For best security, external microphones should be unplugged. If the microphone is built-in and the user decides to disable it, there might be a BIOS option available. Suitably skilled users can also attempt to remove built-in microphones, although this is more difficult.

The drivers for the sound card can also be disabled, which prevents all output/input audio:

* Linux: the names of the drivers can be found in ''/proc/asound/modules''. To blacklist them, create a file in ''/etc/modprobe.d'' containing <code>blacklist (module)</code>, for example <code>blacklist snd_hda_intel</code>. 
* Windows: the drivers can be disabled from the Device Manager.

The microphone can also be muted on Linux by running <code>alsamixer</code> and entering "M" on the microphone channel.

== Select Use of Microphones ==

[[Multiple_{{workstation_product_name_short}}|Multiple {{workstation_product_name}}]] should be used for: 

* Making Internet calls.
* Conducting [[Voip|Voice over IP (VoIP)]].
* Any other microphone use inside {{workstation_product_name}} (<code>anon-whonix</code>). 

In this way, the microphone is used in select {{workstation_product_name}}s and not all. The microphone should be unplugged after use.

For [[VoIP|VoIP]] purposes, audio pass-through capability may need to be enabled for the respective hypervisor. The following section documents how to get audio working on [[Download|supported platforms]].

= Speakers =
Newer methods of advertisement tracking can link multiple devices via ultrasound covert channels. <ref>This deanonymization technique works by playing a unique sound inaudible to human ears which is picked up by the microphones of untrusted devices. Watermarked audible sounds are equally dangerous, which means that hardware incapable of ultrasound is an ineffective protection.</ref><ref>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/11/ads_surreptitio.html</ref>

On the host:

* Always connect headphones. <ref>It is unclear if this measure can be circumvented by malicious software.</ref>
* Physically remove speakers (high difficulty). <ref name=handcraft-skills>Many users are incapable of opening their notebooks.</ref>
* Physically remove the beeper (high difficulty). <ref name=handcraft-skills />
* If possible, disable the beeper in BIOS (moderate difficulty).

}}


Webcams on infected machines can be used to take snapshots, record video or eavesdrop using the built-in microphone. [https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/08/researchers-find-way-to-spy-on-remote-screens-through-the-webcam-mic/ Recent research] reveals that even remote screen views can be accurately determined via webcams, due to "content-dependent acoustic leakage from LCD screens." <ref>This is a novel acoustic side-channel attack variant that relies on neural networks and the "coil whine" audio emissions from electronic components that power the LCD display.</ref>

Always check if the computer or notebook has a webcam; one might be built-in, but have gone unnoticed. Check the computer's datasheet and operating system hardware manager to be sure. It is recommended that (external) webcams are disabled or removed, unless there are immediate plans to use it inside {{workstation_product_name}} (<code>anon-whonix</code>). Once a webcam session has finished, it should be disabled and preferably unplugged straight away. 

If the webcam is built-in, check whether it can be disabled with a BIOS setting. Suitably skilled users can attempt to remove built-in webcams, although this may be difficult. As a stop-gap measure, the webcam can always be covered with thick adhesive tape or a cap, so long as it is opaque.

If a BIOS option is unavailable or it is impossible to physically disable the webcam, then the webcam drivers should be disabled:

* Linux: a file must be added to ''/etc/modprobe.d'' that contains <code>blacklist uvcvideo</code>. This blacklists the webcam driver from loading.
* Windows: the webcam driver can be disabled from the Device Manager.

= Wireless Input Devices =

Avoid using wireless keyboards and mice because most send data unencrypted. Even if this was not the case, the robustness of the cryptography involved in proprietary products cannot be verified. A local adversary up to 100 meters away can sniff keystrokes and inject their own, allowing them to take over the machine.<ref>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/03/security_vulner_6.html</ref> <ref>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/08/security_vulner_7.html</ref>
