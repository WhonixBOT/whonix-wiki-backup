| text    = ''"Security is a process, not a product."'' -- Bruce Schneier, encryption and security expert. <ref name=schneier_security>https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2000/04/the_process_of_secur.html</ref> <ref>Similarly, anonymity is a continual process -- not an end destination -- that is informed by new knowledge that is constantly gathered.</ref>
}}

It is important to understand that {{project name}} and all general software cannot guarantee absolute anonymity or security; 'perfect security' is a mirage. The reason is flaws in hardware and software are ever-present, as continual upgrades and patches inevitably introduce further coding <ref>Security bugs generally fall into two categories: those which pose a passive threat due to eventual erroneous behavior, and the introduction of accidental vulnerabilities that are exploitable with malicious inputs.</ref> or design errors which attackers of varying skill can profit from. As a consequence, the best approach is to try and mitigate risk exposure and provide defense in depth. <ref name=schneier_security /> <ref>Schneier also notes several other security principles: limit privilege, secure the weakest link, use choke points, fail securely, leverage unpredictability, enlist the users, embrace simplicity, detect attackers, respond to attackers, be vigilant, and watch the watchers.</ref>

With this understanding, a material improvement in security and anonymity requires 'raising the bar' against potential attackers and eavesdroppers: <ref>https://github.com/maqp/tfc/wiki/Threat-model</ref>

<blockquote>Security is a process, not a product. It is also about economics. Briefly explained, each attacker has a set of capabilities, privileges, and a certain amount of budget, time and motivation. Given enough of these resources, security of any process will fail; the goal when securing a system is to add layers of security that make attacks too expensive. Nation-state actors have massive budgets, and no single system can be made secure enough against targeted attacks. However, if widely deployed, systems that cannot be compromised with automated attacks, increase the attacker's cost linearly and thus force the attacker to pick targets. Such systems are the only way to make mass surveillance infeasibly expensive.</blockquote>

In the case of {{project_name}}, relative security and anonymity can be improved by utilizing the {{project name}} split-VM design (particularly [[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]]), [[System_Hardening_Checklist|hardening the platform]] as much as possible, and adopting online behaviors which minimize the threat of deanonymization. If you are unfamiliar with {{project name}} / Linux or have limited knowledge of computer security and anonymity topics, then it is recommended to first read these resources:

* The Computer Security Education section
* [[DoNot|Tips on Remaining Anonymous]]
* [[Post Install Advice|Post-installation Security Advice]]
* [[Surfing Posting Blogging|Surfing, Posting and Blogging]]
* [[Warning|Warnings]]

If you have more time available, then it is recommended to read the [[Documentation]] widely.

= Motivation =

If motivation is needed to secure your computer, refer to these articles:

* [https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/06/the-value-of-a-hacked-email-account/ The Value of a Hacked Email Account (blog post).]

If the reader is time-poor, then just review the [https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/HackedPC2012.png Hacked PC] or [https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/HE-1-600x333.jpg Hacked Email] figures, or briefly scan the summary tables below.

== Hacked PC ==

US journalist and investigative reporter Brian Krebs notes there are a large number of malicious uses for hacked PCs, including ransomware, bot activity, stolen account credentials, webmail spam and much more.

== Hacked Email Account ==

Krebs also notes the significant value of a hacked email account. Just one breach of an online email service permits the theft of valuable personal data, account/contact harvesting, re-sale of retail accounts, spam and much more. An email account is a particularly weak link, since once under the attacker's control they can reset the password, along with the passwords of many linked services and accounts.
