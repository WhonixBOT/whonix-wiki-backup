= Configuration =
== Introduction ==
<u>Essential Tor Configuration</u>:

For enabling Tor, disabling Tor and using [[Bridges]] the user can use [[Anon Connection Wizard]]. <ref>
[[Anon Connection Wizard]] stores its configuration file file <code>/usr/local/etc/torrc.d/40_tor_control_panel.conf</code>.
</ref>

<u>Advanced Tor Configuration</u>:

Tor configuration can also be modified by editing the Tor configuration file(s).

{{mbox
| type      = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = It is recommended for simplicity for most users that <u>all</u> unique user Tor configurations should be stored in Tor configuration file <code>/usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf</code> and nowhere else. <ref>
<code>/usr/local/etc/torrc.d/40_tor_control_panel.conf</code> is auto generated. It can be examined but changes should only be made to <code>/usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf</code>.
</ref> Note that Whonix will <u>not</u> modify <code>/usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf</code> once it is created, therefore the user is responsible for adding or removing specific configurations in this file.
}}

[[Configuration_Files#Configuration_Drop-In_Folders|Configuration Drop-In Folders]] <code>/etc/torrc.d/</code> and <code>/usr/local/etc/torrc.d/</code> are a {{Project name}} specific feature. ([[Dev/Tor#Tor_Config_Files|technical details]]) Advanced users and packages specifically supporting {{Project name}} are free to use these folders, however other distributions such as Debian do not support it at time of writing. <ref>
Debian feature request: [https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=866187 add torrc.d configuration directory]
</ref>

== Edit Tor Configuration ==
{{Open /usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50 user.conf}}

== Configuration Check ==
To discover if there are any Tor configuration syntax errors and to see which Tor configuration files are processed in which order, run the following command inside {{gateway_product_name}} ([[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]]: <code>sys-whonix</code>).

{{CodeSelect|code=

The output should be similar to the following.

= Log Analysis =
== Introduction ==
Analysis of Tor's (and [[vanguards|vanguards]]'s) log can be useful if connectivity issues emerge.

Regarding log messages from vanguards, see also [[vanguards#Log_Analysis|vanguards, Log Analysis]].

== anon-log ==
<code>anon-log</code> simplifies the manual [[#Dump Tor Log|dump Tor log]] command by only showing relevant log entries and no [[#Non-Issues|non-issues]].

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo anon-log
}}

The output should be similar to the following.

|-
| <u>{{Code2|Am I compromised? Does Tor's log report leaks?}}
| Tor's output is an ineffective tool for discovering serious issues such as a compromise or leaks.</u>

|-
| {{Code2|[WARN] Socks version 71 not recognized. (Tor is not an http proxy.)}}
| 
This warning is caused by [[systemcheck]], specifically the function {{Code2|check_tor_socks_port_reachability}} which checks if a Tor SocksPort is reachable by trying to fetch it using curl. <ref>
{{CodeSelect|code=
{{Curl_Plain}} 10.152.152.10:9100
}}
</ref> No warnings appear if the function works correctly.

|-
| {{Code2|[warn] Socks version 71 not recognized. (This port is not an HTTP proxy; did you want to use HTTPTunnelPort?)}}
| Similar to above.

|-
| {{Code2|[NOTICE] You configured a non-loopback address '10.152.152.10:9179' for SocksPort. This allows everybody on your local network to use your machine as a proxy. Make sure this is what you wanted. [1 duplicate hidden]}} This notice may reference other port numbers, or the DnsPort or TransPort.
| This notice is not a concern because Tor really listens on that IP/port - it is the internal network interface for {{gateway_product_name}} (<code>sys-whonix</code>) that is only available to {{workstation_product_name}} because {{gateway_product_name}} (<code>sys-whonix</code>) is firewalled. See ''{{W_Firewall}}'' or the {{project_name}} source code for further information.

|-
| {{Code2|[NOTICE] New control connection opened. [2 duplicates hidden]}} A higher number of duplicate messages may also appear.
| This notice is not a concern because it is caused by [[systemcheck]]'s Tor Bootstrap Status Test, which uses Tor's ControlPort or [[Dev/CPFP|CPFP]].

|}

= Version Number =
To discover what Tor version is currently in use, run the following command inside {{gateway_product_name}} ([[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]]: <code>sys-whonix</code>).

{{CodeSelect|code=
anon-info
}}

The output should be similar to the following.

<pre>
INFO: version of the 'tor' package: 0.4.5.9-1~d10.buster+1
</pre>

See also [[Tor_Versioning|Newer Tor Versions]].

= Tor Consensus Re-Download =
While this persists [[Tor Entry Guards]], it results in Tor re-downloading the Tor Consensus document. Should usually not be required. 

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo anon-consensus-delete
}}

<ref>
[https://github.com/Whonix/anon-gw-anonymizer-config/blob/master/usr/bin/anon-consensus-delete <code>anon-consensus-delete</code>] is just a script to automate the following steps for better usability. It does in essence the following this:

== Additional SocksPorts ==
Various custom <code>SocksPorts</code> have already been prepared. Those are documented [[Stream_Isolation#How_to_mitigate_identity_correlation|here]].

Adding additional on top of that is usually not required. Setting a socks user name has the same effect of establishing stream isolation as mentioned on the [[Stream_Isolation|Stream Isolation]] wiki page [[Stream Isolation#IsolateSOCKSAuth|(<code>IsolateSOCKSAuth</code>)]]. Otherwise:

{{Community Support}}

Adding additional Tor <code>SocksPorts</code> to <code>/usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf</code> is non-intuitive. <ref>
https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/15261
</ref>

As noted in the Tor man page (<code>man tor</code>):

<blockquote>By default, an option on the command line overrides an option found in the configuration file, and an option in a configuration file overrides one in the defaults file.

This rule is simple for options that take a single value, but it can become complicated for options that are allowed to occur more than once: if you specify four SOCKSPorts in your configuration file, and one more SOCKSPort on the command line, the option on the command line will replace <u>all</u> of the SOCKSPorts in the configuration file.  If this is not what you want, prefix the option name with a plus sign, and it will be appended to the previous set of options instead.</blockquote>

Nick Mathewson from The Tor Project has also noted: <ref>
https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/15261#comment:1
</ref>

<blockquote>So to make sure that the SocksPort in the torrc does what you want, write it as <code>+SocksPort</code>.</blockquote>

After adding custom ports, a user would also have to edit the {{project_name}} firewall.

== {{project name}} is Preventing Tor from Bootstrapping! ==

Refer to the related [[Why_is_Tor_slow#Whonix_.E2.84.A2_has_Slowed_Tor_Connections_Dramatically.21|{{project name}} has Slowed Tor Connections Dramatically!]] wiki entry. Bootstrapping problems can relate to nation state or ISP censorship of Tor, or relate to the Tor guard in operation. In the latter case, temporarily changing the Tor guard might resolve the issue.

If that is ineffective, users can also:

* Confirm [[System_Requirements|minimum system requirements]] have been met for {{project_name}}.
* Confirm the accuracy of the VM clock with [[Sdwdate|sdwdate]].
* Remove any changes that were made to the {{gateway_product_name}} (<code>sys-whonix</code>) torrc configuration, such as [[Bridges|bridges]], pluggable transports, [[{{gateway product name short}}_Security|seccomp, connection padding]] and so on.
* Test Tor functionality on the host.
* In [[Qubes|{{q_project_name}}]], [[Install_Tor_Browser_Outside_of_Whonix#Moderate:_{{q_project_name}}|test Tor functionality in a non-{{project_name}} AppVM]].
* Increase the amount of RAM available to {{gateway_product_name}} (<code>sys-whonix</code>).
* Follow other [[Troubleshooting]] advice.

== Can I Speed Up Tor or the {{gateway_product_name}}? ==

''Is there a way to configure the number of nodes in a circuit and to allow selection according to their speeds?''

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]

Tor configurations are not limited by using {{project_name}}.
}}

Those who already know how to configure Tor in this way on the command line in vanilla Debian can follow the same procedure in {{gateway_product_name}}. This is not an endorsement for making these manual Tor changes because it is not recommended by Tor developers and thus the {{project name}} team. <ref>Deferring to their expertise on the possible adverse anonymity effects.</ref> This is also the reason there are no instructions in the {{project name}} documentation to manipulate Tor nodes in this way. 

That said, if general instructions were found describing how to achieve this on the host, then the same procedure could simply be repeated in {{gateway_product_name}}.

Although {{project name}} does not modify Tor, the Tor configuration file ''has'' been adapted for {{project_name}}. To inspect the relevant files, check the following on {{gateway_product_name}}: <ref>Changes to the configuration file are made by the [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/anon-gw-anonymizer-config anon-gw-anonymizer-config] package.</ref>

* <code>/etc/tor/torrc</code> file.
* <code>/etc/torrc.d</code> folder.
* <code>/usr/local/etc/torrc.d/</code> folder.
* <code>/usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc</code> file. 

Tor is not patched and the normal Tor deb package is used in {{project name}} [[Dev/Tor#Tor_Version|from deb.torproject.org]].

Any changes to the Tor routing algorithm should be proposed, discussed and eventually implemented upstream in Tor on torproject.org. <ref>This means changes occur for all Tor users and not a subset relying on a particular distribution.</ref> If proposed changes are not adopted by The Tor Project, then the option to create a Tor fork <ref name=fork>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)</ref> is available. Tor has already been forked at least once.

A general {{project name}} design principle is to keep the Tor process as uniform as possible, in order to simplify any security audits. Diverging from this practice would introduce unnecessary complexity, possibly worsen fingerprinting or degrade anonymity, and limit {{project name}} discussions to the security impacts of the modified routing algorithm. For these reasons, the {{project name}} team is strongly disinclined to make any direct changes to the Tor package.

== Can {{project name}} Improve Tor? ==

As outlined in the [[#Does {{project name}} modify Tor?|previous section]], {{project name}} will not implement any changes to Tor directly and any suggested improvements or bug fixes are proposed upstream on torproject.org. This has already [[Dev/Threat Model#Design Document, innovations and research|happened]] on occasion. Creating {{project name}} is a difficult and time consuming endeavor, so Tor improvements are better left to dedicated, skilled developers who are more knowledgeable in this area. 

Skilled coders can always provide upstream patches to Tor, or as a last resort, fork <ref name=fork /> it. Hypothetically, if a fork <ref name=fork /> developed a greater following than the original project due to proven security / anonymity benefits, then {{project name}} would seriously consider making a switch.

== Tor Routing Algorithm ==
Quote Tor Project FAQ [https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#ChooseEntryExit Can I control which nodes (or country) are used for entry/exit?] (bold and underline added)

<blockquote>
Yes. You can set preferred entry and exit nodes as well as inform Tor which nodes you do not want to use. The following options can be added to your config file torrc or specified on the command line:

[...]

'''We recommend you do <u>not</u> use these''' — they are intended for testing and may disappear in future versions. '''You get the best security that Tor can provide when you leave the route selection to Tor'''; overriding the entry / exit nodes can mess up your anonymity in ways we don't understand.
</blockquote>

To make changes to the Tor routing algorithm which benefit anonymity and not actually worsen anonymity it is required to be more clever than the Tor developers. Many questions, suggestions and discussions online only scratch the surface and are unaware of the informational resources:

* [https://www.freehaven.net/anonbib/ Anonymity Bibliography - Collection Anonymity Research]
* Read the [https://blog.torproject.org Tor blog] as there are often blog posts discussing anonymity research such as blog post [https://blog.torproject.org/new-low-cost-traffic-analysis-attacks-mitigations new low cost traffic analysis attacks and mitigations].

The following resources describe the organizational structure of the {{Project name}} project in relation to The Tor Project, Debian and other upstream sources.

== How do I Change Other Tor Settings? ==

Questions are often raised in forums about how other Tor-specific changes can be made in {{project_name}}, such as excluding specific exit nodes. <ref>
http://forums.whonix.org/t/how-to-set-an-exit-node-in-wonix-of-qubesos/9070
</ref>

In many cases, making such changes is already documented {{project_name}} [[Documentation]]. In other cases such changes are discouraged.

In all instances:

# Changes must be made to the Tor configuration file as per [[#Edit Tor Configuration|Edit Tor Configuration]].
# Refer to the [https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en Tor Project Manual] for specific configuration details.

For example, to exclude exit nodes from the Five Eyes countries the Tor configuration would include the following lines:

[[#Tor Routing Algorithm|Discouraged!]]

<pre>
ExcludeExitNodes {us},{au},{ca},{nz},{gb}
StrictNodes 1
</pre>

A [[#Configuration Check|Configuration Check]] should be run afterwards inside {{gateway_product_name}} ([[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]]: <code>sys-whonix</code>) to confirm there are no Tor configuration syntax errors. As these configurations are specific to Tor (and not {{project_name}}), the [[Free_Support_Principle|Free Support Principle]] applies.

== How do I Install the Latest Tor Version? ==

Follow the instructions [[Tor_Versioning|here]] to install later Tor versions from either:

* the {{project_name}} repository; or
* Tor Project APT repositories; or
* Tor Project source code.
