= Configuration Check =
To discover if there are any Tor configuration syntax errors and to see which Tor configuration files are processed in which order, run the following command inside Whonix-Gateway ([[Qubes-Whonix]]: <code>sys-whonix</code>).

{{CodeSelect|code=
anon-verify
}}

The output should be similar to the following.

=====================================================================
</pre>

= Edit Tor Configuration =
{{Open /usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50 user.conf}}

= Log Analysis =

== Introduction ==

Analysis of Tor's log can be useful if connectivity issues emerge.

== Open Tor Log ==

Users can inspect two logs:

* The persistent Tor log: ''/var/log/tor/log''; and/or
* The Tor log since last boot: ''/var/run/tor/log'' <ref>
{{Code2|/var/run/tor/log}} is a Tor configuration file specific to Whonix and an alternative to {{Code2|/var/log/tor/log}}. The former only contains Tor's output since Whonix-Gateway (<code>sys-whonix</code>) last booted. The latter is a permanent log that persists across reboots. The former has a small usability advantage because it is shorter and should therefore contain more relevant information.
</ref>

{{open with root rights|filename=
/var/run/tor/log
}}

== Watch Tor Log ==

Users can also watch Tor's log as it is written.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo tail -f /var/run/tor/log
}}

This command is especially useful when Tor is reloaded or restarted simultaneously in another terminal window. 

To [[#Reload Tor|reload Tor]], run the following command.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo service tor@default reload
}}

To [[#Restart Tor|restart Tor]], run the following command.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo service tor@default restart
}}

= Permissions Fix =
If error messages like the following appear.

<pre>
Oct 24 07:22:15.693 [warn] Directory /var/lib/tor/.tor cannot be read: Permission denied
</pre>

<pre>
Oct 25 12:35:07.460 [warn] Directory /var/lib/tor cannot be read: Permission denied
</pre>

<pre>
Oct 25 12:35:07.460 [warn] Failed to parse/validate config: Couldn't access private data directory "/var/lib/tor"
</pre>

Then apply the following steps.

'''1.''' {{Open a Whonix-Gateway Terminal}}

'''2.''' Apply a permissions fix for the Tor data folder.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo chown --recursive debian-tor:debian-tor /var/lib/tor
}}

'''3.''' {{Restart_Tor}}

Error messages should no longer appear after completing these steps. <ref>[https://phabricator.whonix.org/T855 whonixcheck check /var/lib/tor folder permission]</ref>

! '''Answer'''

|-
| <u>{{Code2|Am I compromised? Does Tor's log report leaks?}}
| Tor's output is an ineffective tool for discovering serious issues such as a compromise or leaks.</u>

|-
| {{Code2|[WARN] Socks version 71 not recognized. (Tor is not an http proxy.)}}
| 
This warning is caused by [[whonixcheck]], specifically the function {{Code2|check_tor_socks_port_reachability}} which checks if a Tor SocksPort is reachable by trying to fetch it using curl. <ref>
{{CodeSelect|code=
{{Curl_Plain}} 10.152.152.10:9100
}}
</ref> No warnings appear if the function works correctly.

| This notice is not a concern because Tor really listens on that IP/port - it is the internal network interface for Whonix-Gateway (<code>sys-whonix</code>) that is only available to Whonix-Workstations because Whonix-Gateway (<code>sys-whonix</code>) is firewalled.

= Version Number =
To discover what Tor version is currently in use, run the following command inside Whonix-Gateway ([[Qubes-Whonix]]: <code>sys-whonix</code>).

{{CodeSelect|code=
anon-info
}}

The output should be similar to the following.

<pre>
INFO: version of the 'tor' package: 0.3.4.8-1~d90.stretch+1
</pre>

= Advanced Topics =

== Additional SocksPorts ==

Adding additional Tor SocksPorts to ''/usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf'' is non-intuitive. <ref>https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/15261</ref>

As noted in the Tor man page (<code>man tor</code>):

<blockquote>
By default, an option on the command line overrides an option found in the configuration file, and an option in a configuration file overrides one in the defaults file. <br />
<br />
This rule is simple for options that take a single value, but it can become complicated for options that are allowed to occur more than once: if you specify four SOCKSPorts in your configuration file, and one more SOCKSPort on the command line, the option on the command line will replace <u>all</u> of the SOCKSPorts in the configuration file.  If this is not what you want, prefix the option name with a plus sign, and it will be appended to the previous set of options instead.
</blockquote>

Nick Mathewson from The Tor Project has also noted: <ref>https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/15261#comment:1</ref>

<blockquote>
So to make sure that the SocksPort in the torrc does what you want, write it as <code>+SocksPort</code>.
</blockquote>

After adding custom ports, a user would also have to edit the Whonix firewall unless they were lucky. For example, various custom ports for such use cases have already been added. Those are documented [[Stream_Isolation#How_to_mitigate_identity_correlation|here]].

== Blacklist Certain Onion Services from Connecting ==

{{mbox

The following is an example onion service that is added to {{Code2|/usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf}}. Replace {{Code2|bbbbbb6qtmqg65g6.onion}} with the actual onion service that should be blacklisted.

== Manual Bridge Configuration ==
It is recommended to first read the main [[Bridges]] article.

For the majority of users, the [[Anon_Connection_Wizard|Anon Connection Wizard]] GUI application is suitable for bridge configuration. The manual bridge configuration steps below are only recommended for advanced users.

=== Step 1: Access Tor Configuration to Add Bridges ===

{{Open_/usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf}}

=== Step 2: Edit Tor Configuration ===

==== Use obfs3 and obfs4 Bridges ====

<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">

Open {{Code2|/usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf}} in an editor, then copy and paste the following text to enable the use of {{Code2|obfs3}} and {{Code2|obfs4}} bridges. <ref>
{{CodeSelect|code=
ClientTransportPlugin fte exec /usr/bin/fteproxy --managed
}}
</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
UseBridges 1
ClientTransportPlugin obfs3, obfs4 exec /usr/bin/obfs4proxy
}}

Now add the bridge IP addresses that were sourced in the [[#Finding_a_bridge_and_choosing_the_right_protocol|Finding a Bridge and Choosing the Right Protocol]] section. Copy and paste the IP addresses to the very bottom of {{Code2|/usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf}}, <u>after the ClientTransportPlugin entries</u>. Users must ensure that "bridge" appears at the beginning of each line.

{{mbox
| type      = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text       = In the <i>obfs3</i> and <i>obfs4</i> examples below: <br />
* <u>Do not copy and paste this list of bridge entries to the {{Code2|50_user.conf}} file.</u> They will not work.
* Retrieve [https://bridges.torproject.org/bridges?transport=obfs3 obfs3 bridges] or [https://bridges.torproject.org/bridges?transport=obfs4 obfs4 bridges] from The Tor Project <u>before</u> editing this file.
* Use <u>either</u> the <i>obfs3</i> or <i>obfs4</i> protocol, not both.
* <u>Capitalization in the {{Code2|50_user.conf}} file matters.</u> For example, bridges will not connect if users type "Bridge" instead of "bridge".

==== Use meek_lite Bridges ====

<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">

Starting with Whonix 14, {{Code2|meek_lite}} bridges are available. To use them, simply add one more line to the {{Code2|/usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf}} file. Take note the bridge type is called {{Code2|meek_lite}}, not {{Code2|meek}} which is used in Tor Browser Bundle. <ref>{{Code2|meek_lite}} actually uses a different implementation of {{Code2|obfs4proxy}}. Forum discussion: https://forums.whonix.org/t/censorship-circumvention-tor-pluggable-transports/2601/3</ref>

Open {{Code2|/usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf}} in an editor, then copy and paste the following text to enable {{Code2|meek_lite}} bridges.

{{CodeSelect|code=
ClientTransportPlugin meek_lite exec /usr/bin/obfs4proxy
}}

An example of {{Code2|meek_lite}} text that must be added to the {{Code2|/usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf}} file is below. The bridge in this example is functional, so a search for other {{Code2|meek_lite}} bridges is unnecessary.

{{CodeSelect|code=
bridge meek_lite 0.0.2.0:2 B9E7141C594AF25699E0079C1F0146F409495296 url=https://d2cly7j4zqgua7.cloudfront.net/ front=a0.awsstatic.com
