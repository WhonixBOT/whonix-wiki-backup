The technical discussion which lead to this conclusion can be found [https://forums.whonix.org/t/hiding-tor-whonix-is-difficult-beyond-practicality/7408 here]. The former version of this wiki page documenting some of the challenges in hiding Tor use from the ISP is still available [https://www.whonix.org/w/index.php?title=Hide_Tor_and_Whonix_from_your_ISP&oldid=48618 here].

As for hiding Whonix from network observers, this is a different subject which is covered on the [[Fingerprint]] page.

= Technical Reasons =

Using private and obfuscated bridges alone does not provide strong guarantees of hiding Tor use from the ISP. As Jacob Appelbaum has noted: <ref>https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-April/002950.html</ref> <ref>http://www.webcitation.org/6G67ltL45</ref>
<blockquote>
Some pluggable transports may seek to obfuscate traffic or to morph it. However, they do not claim to hide that you are using Tor ''in all cases'' but rather in very specific cases. An example threat model includes a DPI device with limited time to make a classification choice - so the hiding is very specific to functionality and generally does not take into account endless data retention with retroactive policing.
</blockquote>

It is impossible to safely use a proxy to hide Tor. The connection between the user and the proxy is unencrypted and this applies to all proxies: http, https, socks4, socks4a and socks5. <ref>[[Comparison_Of_Tor_with_CGI_Proxies,_Proxy_Chains,_and_VPN_Services|Comparison Of Tor with CGI Proxies, Proxy Chains, and VPN_Services]]</ref> This means the ISP can still clearly see that connections are made to the Tor network. This fact is only mentioned here because proxies are constantly (falsely) suggested as a solution whenever this topic comes up in public arenas.

Using a VPN or SSH does not provide a strong guarantee of hiding Tor use from the ISP either. <ref>[[Comparison_Of_Tor_with_CGI_Proxies,_Proxy_Chains,_and_VPN_Services#Comparison_of_Tor_and_VPN_services]]</ref> VPNs and SSHs are vulnerable to an attack called {{Code|website traffic fingerprinting}}. <ref>For a reference for {{Code|website traffic fingerprinting}}, see [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN#VPNSSHFingerprinting VPN/SSH Fingerprinting] [http://www.webcitation.org/6Gmywywoj (w)].</ref>
