Fully documented on its own [[Mixmaster]] page.

Note that everything said in introduction applies and additionally the server administrator can read plaintext as you type or paste. Use with care, perhaps for lower security needs.

== Cypherpunk remailer ==

This may be wrong, feel encouraged to check if the following is correct.

Although there is a big Cypherpunk remailer wikipedia article<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk_anonymous_remailer</ref> and list of Cypherpunk remailer servers<ref>http://www.noreply.org/echolot/rlist2.html</ref>, cypherpunks.to/remailers<ref>http://www.cypherpunks.to/remailers/</ref> says it's using Mixmaster and the helpfile<ref>http://www.cypherpunks.to/remailers/help.txt</ref> explains, that it's safer to use Mixmaster and that Cypherpunk remailer is just an e-mail based interface. Since the full list of typ I and typ II remailer servers<ref>http://www.noreply.org/echolot/</ref> reveals, that most type I (Cypherpunk) are also type II (Mixmaster) servers, I don't see much point into learning and documenting how Cypherpunk remailer works. It doesn't look like an alternative, i.e. doesn't look like Cypherpunk remailer could be used if Mixmaster doesn't work for some reason. It would also defeat the point of this page: sending mails without registration, because you would still require a mail provider.
