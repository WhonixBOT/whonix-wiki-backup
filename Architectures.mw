= Intel AMD amd64 =
<code>AMD64</code> might imply AMD only. This is wrong.

<code>AMD64</code> means '''<u>Intel</u> and <u>AMD</u>'''.

For technical reason, both Intel and AMD, are called <code>AMD64</code>.

Other synonyms include,

* <code>Intel 64</code>,
* <code>x64</code>,
* <code>x86_64</code>,
* <code>AMD64</code> and
* <code>amd64</code> (lower case).

= aarch64 arm64 =
<code>arm64</code> is a synonym for the <code>aarch64</code> architecture.

Other synonyms include:

* <code>64-bit ARM</code>
* <code>AArch64</code>

= Invalid Terminology =
Since Intel produces both, <code>amd64</code> and <code>ARM</code>-based chips <ref>
[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37106572 BBC: Intel factory to make ARM-based smartphone chips]
</ref> it would be wrong (or at least not future-proof) to call <code>amd64</code> Intel.

The same applies to AMD. <ref>
