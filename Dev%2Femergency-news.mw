message validity: (some) messages should only be valid for a certain time

The emergency notification messages should be signed with a different key than the one for repo package signing old and new.

== multi sig ==
Should use multi sig (key splitting).

The Debian apt signing key is on an official debian.org server. The revocation key is on Debian Developer's (DD) machines. (Not necessarily offline machines.)

They would need at least a 7/12 signature to create the Debian apt signing key revocation certificate.

Source:
https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html

So by using multi sig and not keeping the the emergency news signing key only on DD's machines, it would be safer than Debian's apt signing key.

== /etc/apt-revoker.d ==
The code for downloading the revocation certificates should be configurable.

Download the revocation certificates from:

* version 1 - download from clearnet keyservers
* version 2 - optionally download from onion keyservers
* version 3 - optionally download from freenet

== keyserver discussion ==
reread this whole thread https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/sks-devel/2013-12/threads.html#00073

== separate DNS ==
aptrevoker.debian.org so this can be turned off / redirected in case keyservers cannot handle the load

== not speak specifically about DDs ==
Since derivative distributions would handle this similarly.

== test cases ==

* multiple notifications at once
