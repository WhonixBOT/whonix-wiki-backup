|description=How to Report (Security) Bugs to the Whonix Operating System
}}

== Normal Bugs == <!--T:2-->
If you find bugs, please report them to the [https://phabricator.whonix.org/ Whonix issue tracker].

<!--T:3-->
They will be reproduced, confirmed, discussed, workaround posted, fixed in Whonix source code, etc. as fast as possible.

== Security Vulnerabilities == <!--T:4-->
It would be nice if you were to report the bug privately using OpenPGP encrypted mail before publishing it. That would allow Whonix developer Patrick Schleizer to fix the bug and to credit your findings after the next Whonix release.

<!--T:5-->
