|description=How to Report (Security) Bugs in the Whonix Operating System
|image=https://www.whonix.org/w/images/9/97/Ladybug-156624-640.png
}}

== Non-Critical Bugs == <!--T:2-->
Users who find bugs are encouraged to report them to the [https://phabricator.whonix.org/ Whonix issue tracker].

<!--T:3-->
Once notified issues are reproduced and confirmed, developers discuss the problem in order to find a suitable workaround. All Whonix source code fixes and related matters are implemented as quickly as possible, and the finding is posted for the public benefit.

== Security Vulnerabilities == <!--T:4-->
Users are kindly asked to privately report security bugs. Whonix developer Patrick Schleizer should be contacted via OpenPGP encrypted mail <u>before</u> the information is published. This allows the vulnerability to be patched without the Whonix user population being endangered, and the notifier can be credited with the finding(s) after the next Whonix release.
