= Bug Report Recommendations =

== Non-critical Bugs ==

Users who find bugs are encouraged to report them to the [https://forums.whonix.org/ {{project name}} forums]. To assist developers, please refer to the [[#Reporting_Guidelines|Reporting Guidelines]] further below when describing the problem. 

Once notified issues are reproduced and confirmed, developers discuss the problem in order to find a suitable solution or workaround. All {{project name}} source code fixes and related matters are implemented as quickly as possible and the finding is posted for the public benefit.

== Security Vulnerabilities ==
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure Responsible disclosure]: Users are kindly asked to privately report security bugs and describe the problem in detail - see the recommended [[#Reporting_Guidelines|Reporting Guidelines]] below for guidance. Lead {{project name}} developer Patrick Schleizer should be contacted via OpenPGP encrypted mail <u>before</u> the information is published in public forums; see [[Contact|Contacting {{project name}} developers]]. In this way, vulnerabilities can be patched without endangering the {{project name}} population and the notifier can be credited with the finding(s) after the change reaches the stable repository (or next {{project name}} release).

== Reporting Guidelines ==

Before developers take time to answer concerns, the reporter should make a reasonable attempt to demonstrate it is an actual issue.

# Make sure it is an actual bug report and not a support request.
# Read [[Support]].
# Learn about [[Free Support Principle]].
# [http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html How to Ask Smart Questions] 
# [http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html How to Report Bugs Effectively] 
# [http://mywiki.wooledge.org/XyProblem XyProblem]

{{project_name}}, Qubes OS and most other software projects expect thorough reports to include: <ref>
This recommended format is taken directly from the [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/ Qubes OS bug tracker]; for an example, see [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/4842 this bug].
</ref>

# {{project name}} version and platform.
# Affected component(s) or functionality.
# Steps to reproduce the behavior.
# Expected behavior.
# Actual behavior - including detailed console output.
# Context - How has this issue affected you? What are you trying to accomplish? Providing context helps us come up with a solution that is most useful in the real world.
# Relevant [[Documentation]] that was consulted.
# Any related, [https://forums.whonix.org/ non-duplicate issues (bugs)].

The following example report would be considered wholly insufficient by {{project name}} developers:

* <u>Platform</u>: Non-Qubes-Whonix {{VersionShort}}.
* <u>Affected functionality</u>: Updating/upgrading the system.
* <u>Steps to reproduce</u>: Update the system in a terminal.
* <u>Expected behavior</u>: No error messages appear.
* <u>Actual behavior</u>: The message "70 signatures not checked due to missing keys" appears.
* <u>Context</u>: Curiosity.

Instead, further indicators are necessary in order to meet the threshold of a bug report.

== Sample Bug Report ==

In many cases only developers, developers-alike and very technical users will be able to report an actual issue based upon console output. A sample, thorough bug report is given below. <ref>
https://phabricator.whonix.org/T875

A detailed answer to a reported issue is more likely if:

# Reporters exert more effort, provide detailed analysis, perform multiple web searches, and read the source code beforehand; or
# The reporter is a {{project name}} contributor or developer.

= Software Development Cycle =
== Community Feedback ==

The {{project name}} project is highly receptive to genuine feedback and suggested improvements from users. Software projects flourish from community input and every suggestion is noted and considered.

The {{project name}} community is asked to remain patient. The development cycle involves a number of competing priorities and challenges which must be overcome to achieve ambitious roadmap goals. Further, there is also an existing {{backlog}} of unresolved bugs and feature requests to address. See also [[#Policy Rationale|Policy Rationale]].

If {{project name}} resources grow over time, development activity and responsiveness to user input might increase. See also [https://forums.whonix.org/t/linus-doesnt-scale-and-whonix-social-organization-structure-doesnt-scale-yet-either/9097 Linus doesn't scale and Whonix social organization structure doesn't scale yet either].

Often, proposed improvements or fixes to the {{project name}} platform are awaiting implementation due to differing developer priorities, limited human resources and/or the inordinate amount of time required to develop a particular feature or solution. In a minority of cases, the {{project name}} team is unsure how to resolve a bug or implement a specific change / feature. <ref>Some of these relate to cross-platform problems which are not {{project_name}}-specific.</ref>

It is generally unhelpful to debate the priorities laid out in the future {{project name}} roadmap, as this diverts energy from core development. Some major suggestions might become available in the long-term or might never eventuate. See also [[Linux User Experience versus Commercial Operating Systems]] to learn about organizational and funding issues in the Open Source ecosystem.

For some requests it might be possible to:

* get the it solved if you [[#Contributions|contribute]] and/or become a [[Contribute#Contributor|contributor]].
* have the same benefit by applying [[Free Support Principle]].
* pay for it. See [[Professional Support]].

{{Anchor|Patches are Welcome}}

== Contributions ==

Volunteer contributions to {{project name}} are most welcome. All proposed patches are carefully reviewed and merged if appropriate. Volunteers with the requisite coding ability should refer to the current  {{backlog}} and consult with developers before undertaking any significant body of work. See also [https://forums.whonix.org/t/focus-on-low-effort-maintainability/9067 Focus on low-effort maintainability].

== Old Stable Support Policy ==

It is not uncommon for Linux Distributions to support multiple release versions. <ref>
At the time of writing, Fedora supports 2 release versions - Fedora {31,32}; see https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases#Current-supported-releases
</ref> The popular Debian Linux distribution [[About#Based_on_Debian|on which {{project name}} is based]] not only provides the stable, testing and unstable versions, but also maintains support for the old-stable version. The main reason is because it can take a long time for some organizations to plan, test and upgrade all computers when a new stable version is released. <ref>
https://wiki.debian.org/DebianOldStable/#FAQ
</ref> 

Supporting the old-stable version with continued security updates for a period of time provides flexibility when migrating to the stable version. However, even for distributions like Debian that have a large number of developers, it can be very difficult to support both the stable and old-stable versions. This is evident by the limited time that the old-stable version is supported after the new stable is released - currently around one year on average. <ref>https://www.debian.org/security/faq#lifespan</ref> 

Providing extended support for previous stable versions is preferred for both large and small projects alike, but this is infeasible for {{project name}} due to limited human resources. The reason is the vast majority of developer time must be focused on core components of the stable release version, otherwise providing support for both stable and old-stable would unduly stall its development. Therefore, without a significant increase in funding or manpower, the maintenance of two stable release versions is unlikely in the near or distant future.

== Package Upgrade Policy ==

Prior to {{project name}} 14, tickets that were resolved on the {{backlog}} were not automatically pushed to the stable (or even developer) version of {{project_name}}. This meant stable package upgrades were rare -- unless critical security security vulnerabilities were discovered -- thereby entirely avoiding the risk of destabilizing the {{project name}} platform and necessitating manual user fixes. Fixes noted on the issue tracker generally only became available to all users after the next stable version release.

{{project_name}} 14 and later releases have transitioned to a [https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-14-will-be-a-rolling-distribution/5348 rolling distribution], meaning far more frequent updates will filter through to the stable, stable-proposed-updates, testers and developers repositories. Advanced users who do not wish to wait for package updates can of course manually apply fixes to the relevant package(s) before that time. <ref>For example, the {{project name}} [[AppArmor]] profiles package is a prime candidate for manual fixes, as it [[AppArmor#Maintain_Tor_Browser_Functionality|frequently breaks Tor Browser functionality]] when later browser versions are released.</ref>

Phabricator issue tracker labels can be interpreted as follows:

* <u>Reviewed</u>: "Completed in the latest source code version of Whonix" (but not released).  Further testing is required in the next {{project name}} developers-only or testers-only release. 
* <u>Resolved</u>: "Completed in the development version of Whonix".
* There is no specific label to indicate status in the stable {{project name}} release.

= Support Request Policy =

{{project name}} developers will normally only respond if they are convinced an actual technical, privacy or security-related problem has been identified.

In the past, {{project name}} developers provided answers to a wide range of reported oddities, such as console output messages that were difficult for users to understand. Unfortunately this level of attention is no longer possible, for reasons outlined in this chapter. Effective December 1, 2018, the policy concerning responses to support requests and concerns had changed.

== Sample Non-issue ==

For example, if a user reported that the following console message appeared during an [[Update|update]], {{project name}} developers would be unlikely to respond.

<pre>
70 signatures not checked due to missing keys
</pre>

The reason is because developers are aware this is not symptomatic of a technical problem, but rather a minor usability issue. In case of this example, if the user reporting the problem conducted simple Internet research, they would quickly realize the cause of the error is not {{project_name}}-specific. <ref>
For example, see: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/485349/installing-mysql-with-mysql-apt-config-missing-keys
</ref>

As a reminder, most anomalies are generally harmless rather than [[Malware#Indicators_of_Compromise|an indication of a compromise]]:

<blockquote>
If trivial changes are noticed on your system -- such as a duplicate desktop icon -- this is not evidence of a hack or leak. Similarly, if warning or error messages appear that are difficult to understand, in most cases there is no need for panic. If something unexpected occurs such as the appearance of a "htaccess file in home directory", or graphical glitches emerge in [[Nyx]], then it is more likely a harmless bug and/or usability issue rather than a compromise. 
</blockquote>

== Policy Rationale ==

There are several reasons for this policy:

* <u>Developer Time</u>:
** Providing answers for each and every (duplicate) reported (non-)issue costs time, which could be otherwise dedicated to core development and the {{backlog}} of existing bugs.
** To get an insight of the existing developer workload, see [[What we do|selection of {{Project name}} project activities and maintenance tasks]] and [https://forums.whonix.org/c/news/ {{Project name}} News].
** By comparison, generally the architects of complex structures like buildings or hardware (and a myriad of other professions) do not explain any technical details for free to the general public.
* <u>Personal Initiative</u>: {{project name}} is Freedom Software, which means every aspect of the source code is available for review. This level of transparency allows those who spend enough time or monetary resources to analyze everything in detail. In the spirit of Freedom Software, {{project name}} is purposefully opposed to artificial boundaries which make analysis unnecessarily more difficult.
* <u>Feature Richness</u>: Since {{project name}} is [[About#Based_on_Debian|based on Debian]] there are thousands of software packages available for use, and not all oddities can be discussed or explained due to time constraints.
* <u>Usability Issues</u>: In the main, most usability issues will remain out of scope for developer attention. The reason is two-fold: either they are outside the control of the {{project name}} project and/or it is not economically viable due to the very structure of Freedom Software development; see [[#Linux_User_Experience_versus_Commercial_Operating Systems|Linux User Experience versus Comparable Operating Systems]] for further information.

There are several reasons for this wiki entry. First, a link can be posted whenever necessary, thereby saving developers significant time and effort in addressing issues that are out of scope or non-issues. This demonstrates acknowledgement of the report, but also signals it is not cannot be processed at this time. Secondly, answering with a link is better than a non-answer. A nil response makes it unclear if the report has been seen or whether project development is even active. 

Users are welcome to report whatever they like, but it is <u>strongly recommended</u> to first search [https://forums.whonix.org/search the forums] and Internet as per [[Support#Free_Support_Principle|The Free Support Principle]] to see if it was already reported - this is often the case.

It is also absolutely crucial to subscribe to and read the latest {{project name}} news category 'important-news' to stay in touch with ongoing developments. This way users benefit from notifications concerning important security vulnerabilities, potential upgrade issues, common issues and improved releases which address identified issues, like those affecting the updater or other core elements. See [[Stay Tuned]]. Often issues which users are about the report are already mentioned there for example in the changelogs of release announcements.

= Issue Tracker =

== Transition to Discourse Forums ==

In the recent past, all issues were posted to the legacy tracker application: [https://phabricator.whonix.org/maniphest/query/open/ {{project name}} phabricator]. However, the decision has been made to migrate issue tracking to the [https://forums.whonix.org {{project name}} discourse forums]. <ref>
https://forums.whonix.org/t/abolishing-whonix-phabricator-issue-tracker-moving-issue-tracking-to-forums-migrating-phabricator-whonix-org-to-forums-whonix-org/7112
</ref> <ref>Reasons:

* one less web application and account to maintain;
* phabricator updates occasionally break functionality, such as the outbound mailer;
* far more users sign up to the forums and wiki accounts, giving posted issues more visibility;
* developer forum threads often duplicate existing phabricator tickets;
* the relatively "small" number of open tickets at the time of writing (220) makes the (slow) migration to the forums feasible;
* extraneous tickets can be closed during migration; and
* forum search functions allow for multiple tags which all need to be matched at the same time.
</ref>

The links to the existing backlog of open issues (backlog 1) and the new discourse forums backlog location (backlog 2) are below.

== Forum Tags ==

The goal of forum tags is to maximize the usefulness of the {{project name}} forums as a roadmap and issue tracker for project developers. 

Previously there were no guidelines or rules on how to use discourse forum tags; anyone could create, add or change them. <ref>
Previously it did not make sense to have a [https://forums.whonix.org/tag/testers-wanted <code>testers-wanted</code> tag] since there were around 50 requests for testing that were mostly obsolete. Therefore, forum threads listed under that forum tag were minimized to reflect up-to-date contents where testing would be useful.
</ref> Discourse forums tags can now only be changed by [https://forums.whonix.org/g/moderators {{project name}} discourse moderators].

Search query examples:

* [https://forums.whonix.org/search?expanded=true&q=tags%3Astatus_open_issue_todo all <code>status_open_issue_todo</code> issues]
* [https://forums.whonix.org/search?expanded=true&q=tags%3Astatus_closed_issue_implemented all <code>status_closed_issue_implemented</code> issues]
* [https://forums.whonix.org/search?expanded=true&q=tags%3Acomponent_security%2Bstatus_open_issue_todo <code>status_open_issue_todo</code> <code>component_security</code> related enhancement requests (TODO)]
* [https://forums.whonix.org/search?expanded=true&q=tags%3Acomponent_security%2Bstatus_closed_issue_implemented <code>status_closed_issue_implemented</code> <code>component_security</code> related enhancement requests (done)]
* [https://forums.whonix.org/search?expanded=true&q=tags%3Acomponent_research%2Bstatus_open_issue_todo <code>status_open_issue_todo</code> <code>component_research</code> tasks]
* [https://forums.whonix.org/tags list of all forum tags]

You can create a comment in a separate post such as:

* <blockquote>Please open.</blockquote>
* <blockquote>Please close.</blockquote>
* <blockquote>Please re-open.</blockquote>
* <blockquote>Please add tag <code>testers-wanted</code>.</blockquote>
* <blockquote>Please remove tag <code>component_security</code>.</blockquote>

If appropriate, the tag will be changed by a forum moderator. Note that issue-related comments might be deleted if inappropriate, duplicated or for the sake of brevity in the discussion (like when the status update was not changed due to a mistake). Also, tags should not be appended to every discussion or question about the related subject.

If a forum thread is not tagged with the current stable release of {{project name}} or the next {{project name}} release (<code>whonix-15</code> and <code>whonix-16</code> at the time of writing), then it is not on the roadmap. In this case the likelihood the issue will be resolved is lower, whether it is a feature implementation, research/task completion, or bug fix. Please refrain from debating issue priorities or the timeframe for implementation; see [[Reporting_Bugs#Community_Feedback|Community Feedback]].
