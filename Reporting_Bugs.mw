== Non-Critical Bugs ==
Users who find bugs are encouraged to report them to the [https://phabricator.whonix.org/ {{project name}} issue tracker]. To assist developers, please refer to the [[FAQ#Reporting_Guidelines|Reporting Guidelines]] when describing the problem. In most cases it is helpful to report:

* {{project name}} version and platform.
* Affected component(s) or functionality.
* Steps to reproduce the behavior.
* Expected behavior.
* Actual behavior - including detailed console output.
* Relevant [[Documentation]] that was consulted.
* Any related, [https://phabricator.whonix.org/ non-duplicate issues (bugs)].

Once notified issues are reproduced and confirmed, developers discuss the problem in order to find a suitable solution or workaround. All {{project name}} source code fixes and related matters are implemented as quickly as possible and the finding is posted for the public benefit.

== Security Vulnerabilities ==
Users are kindly asked to privately report security bugs and describe the problem in detail - see the recommended [[FAQ#Reporting_Guidelines|Reporting Guidelines]] for guidance. Lead {{project name}} developer Patrick Schleizer should be contacted via OpenPGP encrypted mail <u>before</u> the information is published in public forums; see [[Contact|Contacting {{project name}} developers / Feedback / Questions]]. In this way, vulnerabilities can be patched without endangering the {{project name}} user population and the notifier can be credited with the finding(s) after the change reaches the stable repository (or next {{project name}} release).

== {{project name}} Package Upgrade Policy ==

Prior to {{project name}} 14, tickets that were resolved on the [https://phabricator.whonix.org/ {{project name}} issue tracker] were not automatically pushed to the stable (or even developer) version of Whonix. This meant stable package upgrades were rare -- unless critical security security vulnerabilities were discovered -- thereby entirely avoiding the risk of destabilizing the {{project name}} platform and necessitating manual user fixes. Fixes noted on the issue tracker generally only became available to all users after the next stable version release.

Whonix 14 and later releases have transitioned to a [https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-14-will-be-a-rolling-distribution/5348 rolling distribution], meaning far more frequent updates will filter through to the stable, stable-proposed-updates, testers and developers repositories. Advanced users who do not wish to wait for package updates can of course manually apply fixes to the relevant package(s) before that time. <ref>For example, the {{project name}} [[AppArmor]] profiles package is a prime candidate for manual fixes, as it [[AppArmor#Maintain_Tor_Browser_Functionality|frequently breaks Tor Browser functionality]] when later browser versions are released.</ref>

Phabricator issue tracker labels can be interpreted as follows:

* '''Reviewed:''' "Completed in the latest source code version of Whonix" (but not released).  Further testing is required in the next {{project name}} developers-only or testers-only release. 
* '''Resolved:''' "Completed in the development version of Whonix".
* There is no specific label to indicate status in the stable {{project name}} release.
