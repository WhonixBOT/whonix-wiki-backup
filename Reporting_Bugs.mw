= Reporting Bugs =

== Normal Bugs ==

At the moment Whonix has very few bugs and only one developer. If you find bugs, please report them to the [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues Whonix github issue tracker].

They will be reproduced, confirmed, discussed, workaround posted, fixed in Whonix source code, etc. as fast as possible.

== Security Vulnerabilities ==

It would be nice if you were to report the bug privately using OpenPGP encrypted mail before publishing it. That would allow adrelanos to fix the bug and to credit your findings after the next Whonix release.

See [[Contact|Contacting Whonix developers / Feedback / Questions]].
