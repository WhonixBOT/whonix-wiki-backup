It's a [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/274 known] issue. <br />
VirtualBox upstream bug report: https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/10031 <br />
Cannot be fixed by the Whonix team. [[FAQ#Patches_Required|Patches required]].
Hardware specific.<br />
It has been [https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,1778.msg10753.html#msg10753 reported] that running form internal hdd works better than running from external devices.<br />
A workaround might be "avoid high load on your host operating system". If this bug causes a lot issues to you, your only option is to switch to another [[Main_Page#Download_Whonix|platform]].

<!--T:10--></translate>

=== PAE crash ===
<!--T:11--></translate>

<translate><!--T:12-->
Try this:<br />
Virtual Box -> Right Click on Whonix-Gateway -> Settings -> System -> Processor -> Uncheck the ''Enable PAE/NX'' Box -> OK.</translate>

<translate><!--T:13-->
Repeat that for Whonix-Workstation as well.</translate>

<translate><!--T:14-->
Read the [[<tvar|3>#Boot Options|</> Boot Options]] chapter and use the 486 kernel.</translate>

=== VERR_VMX_MSR_VMXON_DISABLED ===

Try this:<br />
Virtual Box -> Right Click on Whonix-Gateway -> Settings -> System -> Acceleration -> Uncheck the "Enable VT-x/AMD-V" Box -> OK.

<translate><!--T:13-->
Repeat that for Whonix-Workstation as well.</translate>

<translate><!--T:14-->
Read the [[<tvar|4>#Boot Options|</> Boot Options]] chapter and use the 486 kernel.</translate>

If it still doesn't work, also try:<br />
Virtual Box -> Right Click on Whonix-Gateway -> Settings -> System -> Acceleration -> Uncheck the "Enable Nested Paging" Box -> OK.

=== VERR_SSM_FIELD_NOT_CONSECUTIVE ===

<translate>
<!--T:16-->
If you see "{{Code2|Failed to load unit 'PATM' (VERR_SSM_FIELD_NOT_CONSECUTIVE).}}", please enable {{Code2|VT-x}} in BIOS.</translate>

=== Kernel Panic ===
<translate>
<!--T:18-->
This probably similar to [[#PAE crash|PAE crash]] and {{Code2|VERR_SSM_FIELD_NOT_CONSECUTIVE}} issues above. If you can, enable {{Code2|VT-x}} in BIOS. If you cannot, then disable PAE/NX in VirtualBox (see [[#PAE crash|PAE crash]] above for instructions on how to do so) and then read the [[<tvar|5>#Boot Options|</> Boot Options]] chapter and use the 486 kernel.</translate>

<translate>
=== VT-x is disabled in the BIOS. ===
<!--T:19--></translate>
<translate>
<!--T:20-->
If you see this error message.</translate>

<pre>
Failed to open a session for the virtual machine Whonix-Gateway.

VT-x is disabled in the BIOS.
(VERR_VMX_MSR_VMXON_DISABLED).
</pre>

Or.

<pre>
AMD-V is disabled in the BIOS (or by the host OS).
(VERR_SVM_DISABLED).
</pre>

<translate>
<!--T:23-->
Then please enable {{Code2|VT-x}} in BIOS.</translate>

=== Error In supR3HardenedWinReSpawn ===
[[File:VirtualBox_supR3HardenedWinReSpawn.png|400px]]<br />
Don't update whilst the VMs are running and if you do, you need to reinstall [[VirtualBox]].

<translate>
=== Other reasons ===
<!--T:24--></translate>
<translate>
<!--T:25-->
Please have a look at the [[VirtualBox|VirtualBox]] page. It contains instructions on how to properly download and verify the Whonix virtual machine images. There is also help available in form of screenshot or video instructions.

<!--T:26-->
If you still need help, please go to the [<tvar|6>https://www.whonix.org/forum</> Whonix User Help Forum].</translate>

<translate>
== Boot Options ==
 <!--T:27--></translate>

<translate><!--T:28-->
In the grub boot menu you can choose for two seconds. Two kernels are installed by default.

<!--T:29-->
* The default 686-pae kernel.
* A 486 kernel for compatibility.

<!--T:30-->
'''If Whonix works out of the box, you do not need to change anything''' and you can stick to the default 686-pae kernel.

<!--T:31-->
In case you need to [[<tvar|7>#PAE_crash|</> disable PAE]], use the 486 kernel.</translate>

=== INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN GRAIN TABLE AND BACKUP GRAIN TABLE ===
Maybe this will help: Try convert the vmdk to vdi, remove the old vmdk from the VM and attach the new vdi.

= Security and Support Status =
VirtualBox has no dedicated [[Contribute#Maintainer|maintainer]]. Whonix VirtualBox support is a leftover from previous times, where no other [[Main_Page#Download_Whonix|supported platforms]] were supported. Images are still being build by Patrick. But Patrick's focus has now moved to [[Qubes]]. Grave security issues are unlikely due to Whonix's design. Rudimentary testing of new images and updates is being done by Patrick on a Debian host. There is no [[Authorship|Whonix team]] member testing Whonix in VirtualBox on Windows or Mac hosts. No progress on the [https://phabricator.whonix.org/maniphest/?statuses=open%28%29&projects=PHID-PROJ-b33luubd7a7l5svz2hug#R VirtualBox development task list] should be expected. That's why the [[Main_Page#Download_Whonix|supported platforms table]] lists VirtualBox in the column 'security' with 'testing'.

= Help Wanted =
* work on the [https://phabricator.whonix.org/maniphest/?statuses=open%28%29&projects=PHID-PROJ-b33luubd7a7l5svz2hug#R VirtualBox development task list]
* Become VirtualBox [[Contribute#Maintainer|maintainer]] so the [[#Security and Support Status]] can be improved.
