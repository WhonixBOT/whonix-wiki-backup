= Introduction =
https://github.com/Whonix/onion-grater<br />
https://phabricator.whonix.org/project/view/72/

Tor's control port has in context of Whonix, dangerous features. The answer to the Tor control command {{Code2|GETINFO address}} will be the real external IP of the Tor client. Other dangerous commands include {{Code2|SETCONF}}, {{Code2|LOADCONF}} and {{Code2|GETCONF}}. This can not be limited any other way, since the feature request [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8369 Option to limit information Tor's control port discloses] against Tor has not been implemented. By the way, this Tor control port feature makes also a [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/BridgeFirewall Bridge Firewall] impossible. Therefore before{{project name}}6, Whonix-Workstation had no access to Tor's control port. This was because, Whonix-Workstation is not supposed to have an way of finding out its own external IP address.

Before{{project name}}6, this also broke Tor Button's New Identity feature, which essentially sends {{Code2|SIGNAL NEWNYM}} to Tor's control port. While Tor Button's New Identity is still the only feature that was not available when using Tor Browser in Whonix, Tor Button in future will get more and more dependent on Tor's control port.

Tor Browser [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6546#comment:33 by default performs its own control port verification]. It checks using Tor's control port(!), that the socks port Tor reports, is the same one as Tor Browser is configured to use. If it fails, and it would fail in{{project name}}0.5.6, Tor Button would look like disabled and show a failure message. (To see how this would look like,  see [https://forums.whonix.org/uploads/default/original/1X/c2c9bb5dc7efee7a933dd00d3bf0c30c29c99daa.png this screenshot].) (To see how this generates user confusion, see [https://forums.whonix.org/t/something-went-wrong/2080 this forum thread].) Since{{project name}}6 this check is disabled using [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/13079 environment variable to skip TorButton control port verification] (<code>export TOR_SKIP_CONTROLPORTTEST=1</code>) by package [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor/blob/master/usr/lib/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor/torbrowser.sh anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor]. <ref>
https://github.com/Whonix/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor/blob/master/usr/lib/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor/torbrowser.sh
</ref>

In future, Tor Button will likely also use something like [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3652 {{Code2|GETINFO clockskew}}]. Tor Browser developer [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8032 rejected] the idea of not adding the statement {{Code2|require no access to Tor's control port}} to Tor Browser's design.

Therefore all requirements, Whonix-Workstation having no way of finding its own external IP address, joining Tor Browser's fingerprint for{{project name}}users, having no access for Whonix-Workstation to Tor's control port with Tor Buttons new requirement to have access to Tor's control port contradicted itself.

onion-grater has been implemented as a solution. It gives Whonix-Workstation access to a limited selection of Tor's control port commands, using white listing (not blacklisting). For example, it allows {{Code2|SIGNAL NEWNYM}} to make Tor Buttons New Identity feature available for users who use Tor Browser in Whonix-Workstation.

Therefore when onion-grater gets asked {{Code2|GETINFO net/listeners/socks}}, it lies, and answers '250-net/listeners/socks="127.0.0.1:9150"'. This makes Tor Button happy and therefore it shows a "Congratulations!" (success) welcome page on its default homepage about:tor and not the failure page, which would confuse users. Since bug [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9224 TorButton about:tor fails when using additional socks listeners] has been fixed by Tor Tor Project, it that lie wouldn't be necessary anymore. <font size=-3>We're keeping it, because it is not necessary for Tor Button get a full list of all ports Tor is listening on. If an attacker compromised Whonix-Workstation, hiding that list has an advantage. The attacker can probe what ports are available to that Whonix-Workstation, but if the user added extra ports not available to the compromised Whonix-Workstation (only available to another Whonix-Workstation listening on another IP), at least those remain secret. (This is a bit theoretical, because a compromised Whonix-Workstation can spoof its LAN IP and most likely very few users are using ARP spoofing defenses. Should we add ARP spoofing defenses by default at some point, we at least don't have to worry about this point.)</font>

For eventual further Tor control port access requirements by Tor Button, the configuration file of accepted commands has to be extended. If Tor Button would ever ask for anything which violates Whonix's design (Whonix-Workstation has no way of finding out its own external IP address in particular), such as {{Code2|GETINFO address}}, for example if Tor Button wanted to ensure, that the user is not using its own external IP address, a new lie would have to be added to the onion-grater script. In case many more lies are required, lies should go into the config file as well, for now, hard coding is sufficient.

= Whonix-Workstation =
Whonix sets appropriate environment variables for control port (9051), control port ip (127.0.0.1) and control port password "password". The latter is not really in use, its just to make Tor Button happy, because it doesn't default to some password. Tor Button sends it, but its ignored by onion-grater.

This functionality is implemented by the [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor] package. See also [[Dev/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor]].

<s>Tor Browser (running in Whonix-Workstation) is configured by default (not changed by Whonix) to connect to Tor control port 127.0.0.1:9151.</s> TODO: document unix domain socket files

= Whonix-Gateway =
onion-grater listens on{{project name}}internal network interface <ref>
https://github.com/Whonix/whonix-gw-network-conf/blob/master/lib/systemd/system/onion-grater.service.d/30_cpfpy.conf
</ref>, port <code>9051</code>, filters (white list) incoming control port messages and forwards them to the real Tor Control Port listening on <code>ControlSocket</code> <code>/run/tor/control</code>. onion-grater itself uses cookies authentication to authenticate Tor's control port. The latter is not important, since Whonix-Gateway's only purpose is running Tor, its not a multi user operating system, and if it were compromised, cookie authentication wouldn't be of help anymore either.

= Attack Scenarios =
Once Whonix-Workstation has been compromised, the adversary could continuously and/or using a pattern, send white listed commands to Tor. At the moment, only {{Code2|NEWNYM}} would be of interest. When the adversary is also an ISP level adversary, the adversary might be able to see the pattern being produced. This however is not a big risk, since once Whonix-Workstation is compromised, more powerful attacks are available - An adversary could also use "Morse Code", i.e. limit the victims traffic for a few seconds to zero or close to zero, then push the traffic to its maximum. 

More worrying is the extended attack surface.

= Imitating real Tor Control Connection =
Should Tor close the connection, onion-grater will also close client connection. (Same for a real Tor control connection.)

Both real Tor control connection and onion-grater close the connection if commands are sent when the client is not yet authenticated. (With the exception of authenticate, authchallenge and protocolinfo so there is parity.)

Should Tor authentication fail, this is logged and onion-grater closes client connection.

= TorButton =
To get a list of Tor ControlPort commands, that TorButton uses, get into TorButton source code, extract TorButton, then run.

<pre>
grep -r -i torbutton_send_ctrl_cmd *
</pre>

<pre>
grep -r -i sendCommand *
</pre>

= TorButton Network Settings =
<pre>
TorButton -> Open Network Settings...
</pre>

Is using.

<pre>
   "GETCONF Socks4Proxy"
   "GETCONF Socks5Proxy"
   "GETCONF HTTPSProxy"
   "GETCONF ReachableAddresses"
   "GETCONF ReachableAddresses"
   "GETCONF UseBridges"
   "GETCONF Bridge"
</pre>

As the next logical step by the way, they are likely going to add.

<pre>
   "GETCONF HTTPProxy"
</pre>

We are [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor/blob/master/usr/lib/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor/torbrowser.sh setting] environment variable <code>[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/14100 export TOR_NO_DISPLAY_NETWORK_SETTINGS=1]</code> to disable the "TorButton" -> "Open Network Settings..." menu item. It is not useful and confusing to have on a workstation, because Tor must be configured on the gateway, which is for security reasons forbidden from the workstation.

= TorLauncher =
To get a list of Tor ControlPort commands, that TorLauncher uses, get into TorLauncher source code, extract TorLauncher, then run.

<pre>
grep -r -i getconf
</pre>

= Debugging Inspiration =
Quickly install files from package to system.

<pre>
sudo make install
</pre>

Restart onion-grater after making changes to it.

<pre>
sudo service onion-grater restart
</pre>

Watch onion-grater's log on Whonix-Gateway while using it.

<pre>
sudo journalctl -f -u onion-grater
</pre>

Watch kern.log for eventual iptables log messages, run this on Whonix-Gateway.

<pre>
tail -f /var/log/kern.log
</pre>

To see what's being send to onion-grater's port, run this on Whonix-Gateway.

<pre>
sudo tcpdump -i eth1 -l -s0 -w - tcp dst port 9051 | strings
</pre>

To connect to onion-grater from a [[Non-Qubes-Whonix]]-Gateway.

<pre>
nc 10.152.152.10 9051
</pre>

To connect to onion-grater from a [[Qubes-Whonix]]-Gateway.

<pre>
nc $(qubesdb-read /qubes-netvm-gateway) 9051
</pre>

On the Whonix-Workstation you should be able to run.

<pre>
nc 127.0.0.1 9051
</pre>

Type "something". Enter. Should reply "510 Command filtered".

Command.

<pre>
authenticate                                                                                                                                                                        
</pre>

Output.

<pre>
250 OK
</pre>

Command.

<pre>
GETINFO net/listeners/socks
</pre>

Output.

<pre>
250-net/listeners/socks="127.0.0.1:9150"
</pre>

Command.

<pre>
GETINFO address
</pre>

Output.

<pre>
510 Prohibited command "GETINFO address"
</pre>

Command.

<pre>
QUIT
</pre>

= Talking to the real Tor Control Port =
On Whonix-Gateway. ({{Code2|test}} is the example password being used. Feel free to use a different/stronger one.

<pre>
tor --hash-password test
</pre>

Will show something like this.

<pre>
16:1CEAF6E6A08E0CF460AFD71772461C5F56BD9738FA8824B882FCA4A785
</pre>

{{Open /usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf}}

<pre>
HashedControlPassword 16:1CEAF6E6A08E0CF460AFD71772461C5F56BD9738FA8824B882FCA4A785
</pre>

{{Reload Tor}}

<pre>
sudo service tor reload
</pre>

Connect to Tor's ControlPort.

<pre>
sudo --non-interactive -u debian-tor socat - UNIX-CONNECT:/var/run/tor/control
</pre>

Authenticate.

<pre>
authenticate "test"
</pre>

Should reply.

<pre>
250 OK
</pre>

Test your commands. For example.

<pre>
setevents stream
</pre>

Will do nothing after this, but when you start using Tor (i.e. by running Tor Browser, apt-get or so), it will show something like this (events).

<pre>
650 STREAM 211 NEW 0 pop.riseup.net:995 SOURCE_ADDR=10.152.152.11:47036 PURPOSE=USER
...
