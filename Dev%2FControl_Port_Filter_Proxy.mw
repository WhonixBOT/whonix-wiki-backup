Tor's control port has in context of Whonix, dangerous features. The answer to the Tor control command {{Code2|GETINFO address}} will be the real external IP of the Tor client. Other dangerous commands include {{Code2|SETCONF}}, {{Code2|LOADCONF}} and {{Code2|GETCONF}}. This can not be limited any other way, since the feature request [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8369 Option to limit information Tor's control port discloses] against Tor has not been implemented. By the way, this Tor control port feature makes also a [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/BridgeFirewall Bridge Firewall] impossible. Therefore before Whonix 6, Whonix-Workstation had no access to Tor's control port. This was because, Whonix-Workstation is not supposed to have an way of finding out its own external IP address.

Before Whonix 6, this also broke Tor Button's New Identity feature, which essentially sends {{Code2|SIGNAL NEWNYM}} to Tor's control port. While Tor Button's New Identity is still the only feature that was not available when using Tor Browser in Whonix, Tor Button in future will get more and more dependent on Tor's control port.

TBB [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6546#comment:33 by default performs its own control port verification]. It checks using Tor's control port(!), that the socks port Tor reports, is the same one as Tor Browser is configured to use. If it fails, and it would fail in Whonix 0.5.6, Tor Button would look like disabled and show a failure message. (To see how this would look like,  see [https://forums.whonix.org/uploads/default/original/1X/c2c9bb5dc7efee7a933dd00d3bf0c30c29c99daa.png this screenshot].) (To see how this generates user confusion, see [https://forums.whonix.org/t/something-went-wrong/2080 this forum thread].) Since Whonix 6 this check is disabled using [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/13079 environment variable to skip TorButton control port verification] (<code>export TOR_SKIP_CONTROLPORTTEST=1</code>) by package [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor/blob/master/usr/lib/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor/torbrowser.sh anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor]. <ref>
https://github.com/Whonix/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor/blob/master/usr/lib/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor/torbrowser.sh
</ref>

In future, Tor Button will likely also use something like [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3652 {{Code2|GETINFO clockskew}}]. TBB developer [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8032 rejected] the idea of not adding the statement {{Code2|require no access to Tor's control port}} to TBB's design.

Therefore all requirements, Whonix-Workstation having no way of finding its own external IP address, joining Tor Browser's fingerprint for Whonix users, having no access for Whonix-Workstation to Tor's control port with Tor Buttons new requirement to have access to Tor's control port contradicted itself.

Control Port Filter Proxy (CPFP or sometimes called cpfpy) has been implemented as a solution. It gives Whonix-Workstation access to a limited selection of Tor's control port commands, using white listing (not blacklisting). For example, it allows {{Code2|SIGNAL NEWNYM}} to make Tor Buttons New Identity feature available for users who use Tor Browser in Whonix-Workstation.

Therefore when CPFP gets asked {{Code2|GETINFO net/listeners/socks}}, it lies, and answers '250-net/listeners/socks="127.0.0.1:9150"'. This makes Tor Button happy and therefore it shows a "Congratulations!" (success) welcome page on its default homepage about:tor and not the failure page, which would confuse users. Since bug [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9224 TorButton about:tor fails when using additional socks listeners] has been fixed by Tor Tor Project, it that lie wouldn't be necessary anymore. <font size=-3>We're keeping it, because it is not necessary for Tor Button get a full list of all ports Tor is listening on. If an attacker compromised Whonix-Workstation, hiding that list has an advantage. The attacker can probe what ports are available to that Whonix-Workstation, but if the user added extra ports not available to the compromised Whonix-Workstation (only available to another Whonix-Workstation listening on another IP), at least those remain secret. (This is a bit theoretical, because a compromised Whonix-Workstation can spoof it's LAN IP and most likely very few users are using ARP spoofing defenses. Should we add ARP spoofing defenses by default at some point, we at least don't have to worry about this point.)</font>

For eventual further Tor control port access requirements by Tor Button, the configuration file of accepted commands has to be extended. If Tor Button would ever ask for anything which violates Whonix's design (Whonix-Workstation has no way of finding out its own external IP address in particular), such as {{Code2|GETINFO address}}, for example if Tor Button wanted to ensure, that the user isn't using its own external IP address, a new lie would have to be added to the CPFP script. In case many more lies are required, lies should go into the config file as well, for now, hard coding is sufficient.

CPFP limits maximum accepted command string length to 128 (configurable) (credits: <ref>[https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2014-February/005041.html As done by Tails.]</ref> <ref>Thanks to [https://www.whonix.org/old-forum/index.php?action=profile;u=87 HulaHoop] for [https://www.whonix.org/old-forum/index.php/topic,342.0.html suggesting this].</ref>) for better security.

Advanced users who do not wish to use CPFP can disable it, see [[Advanced Security Guide#Disable Control Port Filter Proxy]].

== Whonix-Workstation ==
Whonix sets appropriate environment variables for control port (9151), control port ip (127.0.0.1) and control port password "password". The latter is not really in use, its just to make Tor Button happy, because it doesn't default to some password. Tor Button sends it, but its ignored by Control Port Filter Proxy.

rinetd redirects 127.0.0.1:9151 to Whonix-Gateway 10.152.152.10:9052.

This functionality is implemented by the [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor] package.

Tor Browser points to Tor control port 127.0.0.1:9151 by default (no changes by Whonix).

== Whonix-Gateway ==
Control Port Filter proxy listens on 0.0.0.0 port 9052, filters (white list) incoming control port messages and forwards them to the real Tor Control Port listening in 127.0.0.1:9051. Control Port Filter Proxy itself uses cookies authentication to authenticate Tor's control port. The latter is not important, since Whonix-Gateway's only purpose is running Tor, its not a multi user operating system, and if it were compromised, cookie authentication wouldn't be of help anymore either.

== Attack Scenarios ==
Once Whonix-Workstation has been compromised, the adversary could continuously and/or using a pattern, send white listed commands to Tor. At the moment, only {{Code2|NEWNYM}} would be of interest. When the adversary is also an ISP level adversary, the adversary might be able to see the pattern being produced. This however isn't a big risk, since once Whonix-Workstation is compromised, more powerful attacks are available - An adversary could also use "Morse Code", i.e. limit the victims traffic for a few seconds to zero or close to zero, then push the traffic to its maximum. 

More worrying is the extended attack surface.

== Imitating real Tor Control Connection ==
Should Tor close the connection, cpfpy will also close client connection. (Same for a real Tor control connection.)

Both real Tor control connection and cpfpy close the connection if commands are sent when the client is not yet authenticated. (With the exception of authenticate, authchallenge and protocolinfo so there is parity.)

Should Tor authentication fail, this is logged and cpfpy closes client connection.

== Debugging Inspiration ==
=== Introduction ===
Quickly install files from package to system.

<pre>
sudo make install
</pre>

Restart CPFP after making changes to it.

<pre>
sudo service control-port-filter-python restart
</pre>

Watch CPFP's log on Whonix-Gateway while using it.

<pre>
tail -f /var/log/control-port-filter-python.log
</pre>

To get a list of Tor ControlPort commands, that TorButton uses, get into TorButton source code, extract TorButton, then run.

<pre>
grep -r -i torbutton_send_ctrl_cmd *
</pre>

<pre>
grep -r -i sendCommand *
</pre>

To get a list of Tor ControlPort commands, that TorLauncher uses, get into TorLauncher source code, extract TorLauncher, then run.

<pre>
grep -r -i getconf
</pre>

Watch kern.log for eventual iptables log messages, run this on Whonix-Gateway.

<pre>
tail -f /var/log/kern.log
</pre>

To see what's being send to CPFP's port, run this on Whonix-Gateway.

<pre>
sudo tcpdump -i eth1 -l -s0 -w - tcp dst port 9052 | strings
</pre>

Connect to CPFP from Whonix-Workstation to simulate using it.

<pre>
telnet 127.0.0.1 9051
</pre>

Command.

<pre>
authenticate                                                                                                                                                                        
</pre>

Output.

<pre>
250 OK
</pre>

Command.

<pre>
GETINFO net/listeners/socks
</pre>

Output.

<pre>
250-net/listeners/socks="127.0.0.1:9150"
</pre>

Command.

<pre>
GETINFO address
</pre>

Output.

<pre>
510 Prohibited command "GETINFO address"
</pre>

Command.

<pre>
QUIT
</pre>

=== cpfpy ===
Debugging start command.

<pre>
sudo service control-port-filter-python start
</pre>

Debugging stop command.

<pre>
sudo service control-port-filter-python stop
</pre>

To find any eventual leftovers, stale processes, try this.

<pre>
ps aux | grep cpfpd
</pre>

or

<pre>
ps aux | grep python
</pre>

On the gateway, talk to cpfpy directly.

<pre>
telnet 10.152.152.10 9052
</pre>

To check if the port is free, if cpfpy really has shut down.

<pre>
sudo lsof -i :9052
</pre>

<pre>
COMMAND   PID       USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
cpfpd 27653 debian-tor    4u  IPv4  73153      0t0  TCP 10.152.152.10:9052 (LISTEN)
</pre>

=== Talking to the real Tor Control Port ===
On Whonix-Gateway. ({{Code2|test}} is the example password being used. Feel free to use a different/stronger one.

<pre>
tor --hash-password test
</pre>

Will show something like this.

<pre>
16:1CEAF6E6A08E0CF460AFD71772461C5F56BD9738FA8824B882FCA4A785
</pre>

Add to /etc/tor/torrc.

<pre>
HashedControlPassword 16:1CEAF6E6A08E0CF460AFD71772461C5F56BD9738FA8824B882FCA4A785
</pre>

Reload Tor.

<pre>
sudo service tor reload
</pre>

Connect to Tor's ControlPort.

<pre>
telnet 127.0.0.1 9051
</pre>

Authenticate.

<pre>
authenticate "test"
</pre>

Should reply.

<pre>
250 OK
</pre>

Test your commands. For example.

<pre>
setevents stream
</pre>

Will do nothing after this, but when you start using Tor (i.e. by running Tor Browser, apt-get or so), it will show something like this (events).

<pre>
650 STREAM 211 NEW 0 pop.riseup.net:995 SOURCE_ADDR=10.152.152.11:47036 PURPOSE=USER
...
</pre>

= Future Tor ControlPort Commands =
== Tor Browser 4.5 ==
Tor Browser 4.5 uses a few more Tor ControlPort commands. Let's consider which we are going to add, about which ones we are going to "lie" etc. and what we do about them (providing patches to make it better work on systems were Tor is running on a different system than Tor Browser.

=== setevents stream and getinfo config-text ===
CPFP (bash) log as of Whonix 9.4.

<pre>

</pre>

<pre>
   "setevents stream"
   "getinfo config-text"
</pre>

* "getinfo config-text" seems problematic, because it would be best if the workstation had no way of knowing what bridges or other interesting settings a user might have set on the gateway.
* "setevents stream" what is it good for? Problematic, because neither cpfp (bash) nor cpfpy support subscribing to Tor ControlPort events yet.

=== TorButton Network Settings ===
<pre>
TorButton -> Open Network Settings...
</pre>

Is using.

<pre>
   "GETCONF Socks4Proxy"
   "GETCONF Socks5Proxy"
   "GETCONF HTTPSProxy"
   "GETCONF ReachableAddresses"
   "GETCONF ReachableAddresses"
   "GETCONF UseBridges"
   "GETCONF Bridge"
</pre>

As the next logical step by the way, they are likely going to add.

<pre>
   "GETCONF HTTPProxy"
</pre>

We are [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor/blob/master/usr/lib/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor/torbrowser.sh setting] environment variable <code>[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/14100 export TOR_NO_DISPLAY_NETWORK_SETTINGS=1]</code> to disable the "TorButton" -> "Open Network Settings..." menu item. It is not useful and confusing to have on a workstation, because Tor must be configured on the gateway, which is for security reasons forbidden from the workstation.

== How to get it running in Whonix 13 ==

On Whonix-Workstation.

<pre>
sudo whonix_repository --baseuri https://deb.whonix.org --enable --repository developers
</pre>

<pre>
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
</pre>

On Whonix-Gateway.

<pre>
sudo apt-get install git
</pre>

<pre>
git clone https://git-tails.immerda.ch/tails
</pre>



<pre>
sudo whonix_repository --baseuri https://deb.whonix.org --enable --repository developers
</pre>

<pre>
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get --yes dist-upgrade
</pre>

----

Then tor-controlport-filter by Tails should be ready. On the gateway you should be able to run:

Whonix-Gateway (for [[Non-Qubes-Whonix]])
<pre>
nc 10.152.152.11 9051
</pre>

(THIS IS NOT TESTED:) Then tor-controlport-filter by Tails should be ready. On the workstation you should be able to run:

<pre>
nc 127.0.0.1 9151
</pre>

Type "something". Enter. Should reply "510 Command filtered". On the gateway you should see some tor-controlport-filter by Tails debug output.
