'''UNFINISHED!'''

= Introduction =
The high level overview of this concept is as follows:

# Create a regular GPG keypair. By default GPG creates one signing subkey (your identity) and one encryption subkey (how you receive messages intended for you).
# Use GPG to add an additional signing subkey to your keypair. This new subkey is linked to the first signing key. Now we have three subkeys.
# This keypair is your master keypair. Store it in a protected place like your house or a safe-deposit box. Your master keypair is the one whose loss would be truly catastrophic.
# Copy your master keypair to your laptop. Then use GPG to remove the original signing subkey, leaving only the new signing subkey and the encryption subkey. This transforms your master keypair into your laptop keypair.

= Prerequisites =
You should know how to boot other operating systems than your primary every day operating system from Live DVD and/or other external media such as USB.

Optionally, if your storage medium could get accessed to stolen by an adversary, it is also recommended to learn how to use disk encryption software.

= Creating your initial keypair =
Use the {{Code2|gpg ‐‐gen-key}} command to create a new GPG keypair.

You may want your key to expire; it’s up to you. When prompted for a passphrase, make sure to pick a long and unique one. If your key gets stolen, this passphrase is the only thing protecting it!

Now we set our key to prefer stronger hashes. Use the {{Code2|gpg ‐‐edit-key}} command. At the gpg> prompt, enter the command {{Code2|setpref SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224 AES256 AES192 AES CAST5 ZLIB BZIP2 ZIP Uncompressed}} (note that this will probably be cut off in the example below; highlight it with your mouse to see it), then save.

Now for the special sauce: let’s add our new signing subkey.

Use the {{Code2|gpg ‐‐edit-key}} command. At the gpg> prompt, enter the command addkey. Select RSA (sign only) and 4096 for the keysize. Don’t forget to save at the last gpg> prompt:

= Creating a revocation certificate =
Now we generate a revocation certificate file. If your master keypair gets lost or stolen, this certificate file is the only way you’ll be able to tell people to ignore the stolen key. This is important, don’t skip this step!

<pre>
gpg --output bilbo@shire.org.gpg-revocation-certificate --gen-revoke bilbo@shire.org
</pre>

Store the revocation certificate file in a different place than your master keypair (which we’ll export in a later step). You’ll use it to revoke your master keypair should you lose access to it. If you only lose access to your laptop keypair, then you’ll revoke those subkeys using the master keypair, not this revocation certificate.

= Exporting the final product =
Now that your keypair has been created, let’s export it so that we can back it up:

<pre>
gpg --export-secret-keys --armor bilbo@shire.org > bilbo@shire.org.private.gpg-key
gpg --export --armor bilbo@shire.org > bilbo@shire.org.public.gpg-key
</pre>

This will create two files: your public key and your private key. Protect these two files, along with the revocation certificate file, as best as you can—don’t keep them on your laptop, keep them in your house or in a safe-deposit box. These three files are your master keypair.
