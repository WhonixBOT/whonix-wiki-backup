= {{project_name}} Platform Goals =
Developers believe that everyone has the right to private and secure browsing, communications, and hosting of services on the Internet. The {{project_name}} platform has been expressly created to achieve these intended goals. As outlined on the [[Main_Page|Main Page]], the primary user groups are:

* People who value privacy as a fundamental right.
* Average computer users in repressed or censored environments.
* Investigators and whistle-blowers.
* Researchers, government officials and business-people.
* Journalists.
* Political activists.

If there is any doubt, {{project_name}} was never designed to hide users who engage in criminal/unlawful acts. Neither was it intended for abusive users who wish to anonymously harass others, or otherwise undertake legally or morally questionable behaviors.

= {{project_name}} Forum Goals =

<u>Reminder</u>: The primary forum aims include: education, fostering innovation and cooperation, resolution of {{project_name}} problems, further improvement of {{project_name}} security and privacy for all users, and assistance to individuals so they can safely achieve their (legal) goals.

Before engaging in the forums or requesting assistance, first thoroughly search the {{project_name}} documentation. Many common questions have already been addressed in relevant chapters.

If suitable information cannot be located, please refer to the following rules before posting. Users who violate these rules may have their accounts suspended or deleted without notice.

= {{project_name}} Forum Non-Purposes =

* [[Limitations_on_Free_Speech_on_{{project_name_short}}_Website|A free speech platform.]]
