{{Tunnels_Introduction}}

There are at least two ways to connect to a VPN before Tor (User -> VPN -> Tor -> Internet): Using software on the host operating system and using software on Whonix-Gateway.

What's the difference of installing a VPN on the host versus installing on Whonix-Gateway?

=== VPN Software on Host OS ===

When using a Whonix-Gateway virtual machine, connect to a VPN using software on the host operating system (and not on the Whonix-Workstation nor Whonix-Gateway).

Using software inside the host operating system may be more convenient if your more familiar with the host operating system than Whonix. Additionally, your VPN provider might provide custom software with tools for connecting to their servers. However, there are issues that you must consider:
* A VPN on the host operating system will route all traffic originating from the host through the VPN, as well as Whonix's traffic. It is up to your preferences, if you like this or not.
* Your VPN software may not be designed or configured to "fail closed". That is, if your VPN session suddenly disconnects, your Tor connection will be automatically sent through your ISP without going through your VPN service. 

==== How to add the VPN in Host OS ====

Use the host operating system's built-in tools connect to your VPN or use the software provided by your VPN service.

Use a Fail Closed Mechanism!

=== VPN Software on Whonix-Gateway ===

Whonix-Gateway can be configured to connect to a VPN server before Tor, as well as "fail closed", blocking all Tor traffic if the VPN disconnects. 

==== How to add the VPN in Whonix-Gateway ====

After installing Whonix-Gateway, do the following steps before activating Tor in {{Code|Whonix Setup Wizard}}.

1. {{Firewall Settings}}

2. Add the following settings. You can skip comments (starting with {{Code|#}}). Note: make sure to adjust the {{Code|VPN_SERVERS}} variable in your config (unless you are using {{Code|seattle.vpn.riseup.net}} as your VPN service).

<pre>
###########################
## VPN-Firewall Settings ##
###########################
## Make sure Tor always connects through the VPN.
## Enable: 1
## Disable: 0
## DISABELD BY DEFAULT, because it requires a VPN provider.

## IP address of the VPN server.
## Get the IP using: nslookup vpn-example-server.org
## Example: seattle.vpn.riseup.net
## Some providers provide multiple VPN servers.
## You can enter multiple IP addresses, separated by spaces.
VPN_SERVERS="198.252.153.26"

## For OpenVPN.
VPN_INTERFACE=tun0

## Destinations you don not want routed through the VPN.
## 10.0.2.2/24: VirtualBox DHCP

</pre>

3. Save.

4. {{Reload Firewall}}

5. Now setup OpenVPN. It should be able to connect. You find [[Tunnels/Examples#Examples_of_setting_up_VPNs_to_work_with_Whonix|example instructions here]].

6. Enable Tor using Whonix Setup Wizard.
