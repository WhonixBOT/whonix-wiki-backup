== Current Situation ==
Yes, {{project_name}} can be used on a USB.

# [[Host Operating System Selection|Select a suitable host operating system]].
# Install it on USB.
# Install a [[Download|supported virtualizer]].
# Finally install {{project_name}}.

At this time, {{project_name}} does not provide a USB creator / image.

There are a number of online guides explaining how to [https://www.debian.org/CD/live/ install Linux on a USB]. These instructions can be followed to create a live {{project_name}} USB, with the exception that both a supported virtualizer and {{project_name}} must also be installed on the external media.

== Advantages ==
A higher level of security is attained by installing the host operating system(s) required for {{project_name}} on a dedicated, ([[Full Disk Encryption|encrypted]]), external disk(s) like a USB flash drive, FireWire or eSATA device: 

* Using external media reduces the risk of other operating system(s) infecting the {{project name}} host operating system. 
* When {{project_name}} disk(s) are not in use, they can either be removed or hidden.
