Specifically useful as a host operating system on USB is Debian or [[Kicksecure]] in combination with the <code>grub-live</code> software package which makes it possible to boot the host operating system into [[Host Live Mode]].

== Advantages ==
A higher level of security is attained by installing the host operating system(s) required for {{project_name}} on a dedicated, ([[Full Disk Encryption|encrypted]]), external disk(s) like a USB flash drive, FireWire or eSATA device: 

* Using external media reduces the risk of other operating system(s) infecting the {{project name}} host operating system. 
* When {{project_name}} disk(s) are not in use, they can either be removed or hidden.
