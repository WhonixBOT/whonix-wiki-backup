Phone Number Validation vs User Privacy
}}

Some applications such as [[Signal]] and Telegram require require the user to provide a phone number for verification.

The mandatory linkage of the software application with a phone number makes it very likely adversaries can easily link any 'anonymous' use of such applications in {{project_name}} with a user's real identity, even if a secondary phone number is used as a limited workaround. At time of writing user requests to enable registration with an email account as a possible alternative have been ignored or denied by some developers of such applications. For this reason alone, alternative options like [[Chat#Gajim|Gajim]], [[HexChat|HexChat]] and [[Chat#Tox|Tox]] should be investigated instead; see [[Chat|Instant Messenger Chat]] for further information. Readers are of course free to ignore this advice.

In many cases (such as Signal and Telegram) the number can be different form the device's SIM card; it can be a landline or VOIP number, so long as the user can receive the verification code and possesses a separate device to set up the software.
