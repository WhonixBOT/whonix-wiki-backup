'''UNFINISHED!'''

= Updating Whonix Deb Packages from Source Code =
Might be a good idea to create a backup and/or snapshot before trying to update.

Open a terminal. You need Whonix source code, please refer to [[Dev/Build Documentation]].

If you haven't done already, remove Whonix's APT repository.

<pre>
sudo whonix_repository --disable
</pre>

Get all build dependencies.

<pre>
sudo ./build-steps.d/1100_prepare-build-machine
</pre>

Create the packages.

<pre>
./build-steps.d/1200_create-debian-packages
</pre>

Upgrade Whonix Debian Packages without contacting a Whonix's APT Repository, using your own locally created apt package repository.

For Whonix-Gateway.

<pre>
sudo ./debug-steps/locally-upgrade-whonix-debian-packages --bare-metal --tor-gateway
</pre>

For Whonix-Workstation.

<pre>
sudo ./debug-steps/locally-upgrade-whonix-debian-packages --bare-metal --tor-workstation
</pre>

There will be a lot debug output. <ref>Unless you log in as root and run "export WHONIX_DEB_DEBUG=0".</ref>

If everything went well, you will see <ref>Or saying Whonix-Gateway respectively</ref> <ref>It won't, if you have "export WHONIX_DEB_DEBUG=0" set.</ref>

<pre>
########################################################################
## INFO: Successfully configured (postinst script) Whonix-Workstation. #
########################################################################
</pre>

Last message will be probably <ref>"probably" means, if we don't change some messages in meanwhile and forget to update this page.</ref>:

<pre>
+ true 'INFO: Skipping script, because BARE_METAL=1: /home/user/whonix_dot/Whonix/help-steps/unmount-img'
</pre>

In case an any error is caught, the script will loudly complain by echoing in a red colored error message:

<pre>
ERROR in ./debug-steps/locally-upgrade-whonix-debian-packages! Aborted.
</pre>

Lets hope it works well. Please get in [[Support|Contact]] should there be any issues. Leave feedback if you are using this, if it worked for you, which issues you may have had, so these instructions can be updated.
