= Discourse Forums as Issue Tracker =
'''Proposal'''

Previously there were no guidelines / rules on how to use discourse forum tags. Anyone could create them / add them / change them. <ref>
Previously it did not make sense to have a tag [https://forums.whonix.org/tag/testers-wanted <code>testers-wanted</code> with arround 50 requests for testing of which most were obsolete already]. Therefore forum threads listed under that forum tag were minimized to up to date contents where testing would be useful.
</ref>

The new plan is to [https://forums.whonix.org/t/abolishing-whonix-issue-tracke-moving-issue-tracking-to-forums-migrating-phabricator-whonix-org-to-forums-whonix-org/7112 abolish Whonix phabricator issue tracker, moving issue tracking to discourse forums and migrating phabricator.whonix.org to forums.whonix.org].

Discourse forums tags are now only changeable by [https://forums.whonix.org/g/moderators Whonix discourse moderators].

https://forums.whonix.org/tag/open_issue

You can create a comment in a separate post such as:

* <blockquote>Please open.</blockquote>
* <blockquote>Please close.</blockquote>
* <blockquote>Please re-open.</blockquote>
* <blockquote>Please add tag <code>testers-wanted</code>.</blockquote>
* <blockquote>Please remove tag <code>research</code>.</blockquote>

If appropriate, the tag will be changed by a forum moderator. Such comments might be deleted if inappropriate, duplicated or for brevity of the discussion (such as in case the status was only not updated due to as mistake).

If a forum thread is not tagged with <code>whonix-15</code> (the current stable release of Whonix) at time of writing to <code>whonix-16</code> (the next Whonix release) then it is not on the roadmap. In result chances the issue will be resolved (feature implemented, research/task done, or bug fixed) is lower. Please abstain from debating priorities which issue is more/less important or when it should be implemented. ([[Reporting_Bugs#Community_Feedback|reasons]])

Tags should not be appended to every discussion or question about the related subject.

The goal of forum tags is to maximize the forum's usefulness as a roadmap and issue tracker.

Discourse can auto post if tag was changed?

<ref>
Works. Tested by Patrick. <br />
Created a herald rule for Patrick. The rule itself is only visible to admins: <br />
https://phabricator.whonix.org/herald/rule/1/ <br />
Dunno if the visibility of the rule can be changed. Asked in #phabricator irc.freenode.net. No answer. But nevermind.
<br />
It worked. See: <br /> 
https://phabricator.whonix.org/T39
adretest created a new ticket and Patrick was automatically added to cc by phabricator because of the herald rule.

= Github Issues =
Used Github Issues previously. Third party hosted. Potential vendor lock-in issue. Hard to migrate to another platform using API. Hard to make a full backup and import elsewhere.

Own experience by Patrick: Github did hide (delete) tickets if these were created by an account which later got compromised by a spammer. No notification about this is being sent out. Only github support can restore. Thereby notes can get too easily lost / forgotten.

= Phabricator Issues =
* forums and issue tracker require different accounts (inconvenience, usability issue)
* [https://secure.phabricator.com/T11268 no integration with discourse forums], therefore usability issue, discussion on issue tracker are disconnected from forum discussions
* [https://forums.whonix.org/t/phabricator-account-sign-ups-now-needs-manual-confirmation/4668 spam registration issue]
* [https://discourse.phabricator-community.org/t/phabricator-file-is-huge-whats-inside-how-to-shrink/3823 excessive auto mysql backup size]
* [https://secure.phabricator.com/T13011 does not support bounties]
* [https://secure.phabricator.com/T10538 does not have bridge to github], therefore hard to connect to bountysource
* [https://www.bountysource.com/issues/1384856-add-support-for-phabricator bountysource does not support phabricator]
* deleting objects cumbersome
* Whonix's least popular web app (more popular are discourse forums and mediawiki)
