= Discourse Forums as Issue Tracker =
Previously there were no guidelines / rules on how to use discourse forum tags. Anyone could create them / add them / change them.

The new plan is to [https://forums.whonix.org/t/abolishing-whonix-issue-tracke-moving-issue-tracking-to-forums-migrating-phabricator-whonix-org-to-forums-whonix-org/7112 abolish Whonix phabricator issue tracker, moving issue tracking to discourse forums and migrating phabricator.whonix.org to forums.whonix.org].

Discourse forums tags are now only changeable by [https://forums.whonix.org/g/moderators Whonix discourse moderators].

https://forums.whonix.org/tag/open_issue

You can create a comment in a separate post such as

* <blockquote>Please open.</blockquote>
* <blockquote>Please close.</blockquote>
* <blockquote>Please re-open.</blockquote>
* <blockquote>Please add tag `testers-wanted`.</blockquote>

If appropriate, the tag will be changed by.

Works. Tested by Patrick. <br />
Created a herald rule for Patrick. The rule itself is only visible to admins: <br />
https://phabricator.whonix.org/herald/rule/1/ <br />
Dunno if the visibility of the rule can be changed. Asked in #phabricator irc.freenode.net. No answer. But nevermind.
<br />
It worked. See: <br /> 
https://phabricator.whonix.org/T39
adretest created a new ticket and Patrick was automatically added to cc by phabricator because of the herald rule.

= Github Issues =
Used Github Issues previously. Third party hosted. Potential vendor lock-in issue. Hard to migrate to another platform using API. Hard to make a full backup and import elsewhere.

Own experience by Patrick: Github did hide (delete) tickets if these were created by an account which later got compromised by a spammer. No notification about this is being sent out. Only github support can restore. Thereby notes can get too easily lost / forgotten.

= Phabricator Issues =
* forums and issue tracker require different accounts (inconvenience, usability issue)
* [https://secure.phabricator.com/T11268 no integration with discourse forums], therefore usability issue, discussion on issue tracker are disconnected from forum discussions
* [https://forums.whonix.org/t/phabricator-account-sign-ups-now-needs-manual-confirmation/4668 spam registration issue]
* [https://discourse.phabricator-community.org/t/phabricator-file-is-huge-whats-inside-how-to-shrink/3823 excessive auto mysql backup size]
* [https://secure.phabricator.com/T13011 does not support bounties]
* [https://secure.phabricator.com/T10538 does not have bridge to github], therefore hard to connect to bountysource
* [https://www.bountysource.com/issues/1384856-add-support-for-phabricator bountysource does not support phabricator]
* deleting objects cumbersome
