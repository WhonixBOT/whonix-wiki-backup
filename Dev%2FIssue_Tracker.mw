<ref>
Works. Tested by Patrick. <br />
Created a herald rule for Patrick. The rule itself is only visible to admins: <br />
https://phabricator.whonix.org/herald/rule/1/ <br />
Dunno if the visibility of the rule can be changed. Asked in #phabricator irc.freenode.net. No answer. But nevermind.
<br />
It worked. See: <br /> 
https://phabricator.whonix.org/T39
adretest created a new ticket and Patrick was automatically added to cc by phabricator because of the herald rule.

= Github Issues =
Used Github Issues previously. Third party hosted. Potential vendor lock-in issue. Hard to migrate to another platform using API. Hard to make a full backup and import elsewhere.

Own experience by Patrick: Github did hide (delete) tickets if these were created by an account which later got compromised by a spammer. No notification about this is being sent out. Only github support can restore. Thereby notes can get too easily lost / forgotten.

= Phabricator Issues =
* forums and issue tracker require different accounts (inconvenience, usability issue)
* [https://secure.phabricator.com/T11268 no integration with discourse forums], therefore usability issue, discussion on issue tracker are disconnected from forum discussions
* [https://forums.whonix.org/t/phabricator-account-sign-ups-now-needs-manual-confirmation/4668 spam registration issue]
* [https://discourse.phabricator-community.org/t/phabricator-file-is-huge-whats-inside-how-to-shrink/3823 excessive auto mysql backup size]
* [https://secure.phabricator.com/T13011 does not support bounties]
* [https://secure.phabricator.com/T10538 does not have bridge to github], therefore hard to connect to bountysource
* [https://www.bountysource.com/issues/1384856-add-support-for-phabricator bountysource does not support phabricator]
* deleting objects cumbersome

Idea:

[https://forums.whonix.org/t/abolishing-whonix-issue-tracke-moving-issue-tracking-to-forums-migrating-phabricator-whonix-org-to-forums-whonix-org/7112 abolishing Whonix issue tracke, moving issue tracking to forums, migrating phabricator.whonix.org to forums.whonix.org]
