= Interpreting Test Results =

Sites like <code>whoer.net</code> or <code>ip-check.info</code> are unable to adequately assess and demonstrate the threat of fingerprinting techniques with respect to [[Tor Browser]]. These sites generally check for various browser characteristics as well as enabled functionality to reveal specific identifiers. Many of these identifiers require JavaScript, but reports commonly include elements like HTTP headers and attributes, the User Agent, numerous JavaScript attributes, IP address, operating system indicators, browser plugins, cookies, cache, browser window dimensions, fonts and so on. If these elements are enabled/activated, then the browser test sites provide more fine-grained results -- although the [https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/ Tor Browser design] has already taken many into account.

Tor Browser developers have carefully considered [https://2019.www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#identifier-linkability Cross-Origin Identifier Unlinkability] and [https://2019.www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#fingerprinting-linkability Cross-Origin Fingerprinting Unlinkability] defenses in their anonymity design. Efforts are focused upon:
* First party isolation of all browser identifier sources (such as cookies, cache etc.) by browser tab. These are deleted after closing the browser, but are saved temporarily while the browser is open so most sites are accessible.
* Specific fingerprinting defenses such as disabling browser plugins, preventing HTML5 data extraction, preventing access to the local host and WebRTC API, resizing browser windows to specific dimensions, and many more.

A fundamental principle adopted to improve Tor Browser anonymity is to make all users appear as uniform (similar) as possible, thereby greatly reducing the effectiveness of tracking efforts by various websites and network observers who rely on identifiers. To learn more about how The Tor Project is preparing to defend against future fingerprinting threats, refer to this recent (2019) blog post: [https://blog.torproject.org/browser-fingerprinting-introduction-and-challenges-ahead Browser Fingerprinting: An Introduction and the Challenges Ahead].

= Making Browsers Safer =

Browser fingerprinting defenses are imperfect and most probably always will be. {{Browser_Fingerprinting_Footnote}} However, steady improvements are being made over time despite the emergence of novel tracking threats identified by researchers and developers alike. There are certainly too few volunteers who are <u>seriously</u> focused on testing browsers and defeating browser fingerprinting methods.

= Browser Test Sites =

== AmIUnique == 

* https://amiunique.org/ -- [https://github.com/DIVERSIFY-project/amiunique GitHub source code]. This is a general fingerprinting site relying on common identifiers.

== Doileak.com ==

* https://www.doileak.com -- This is another site testing the most common leaks such as IP address, operating system, browser, connection type, timezone difference, WebGL support and so on. However, it includes some uncommon tests such as UDP and torrent leak tests.

== Fingerprint Central ==
 
[https://fpcentral.tbb.torproject.org/ Fingerprint Central] is the successor to the https://fpcentral.irisa.fr website which now appears defunct. The original code is still [https://github.com/plaperdr/fp-central found on GitHub] and can be run locally to help Tor Browser developers rapidly create prototype defenses. <ref>https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2016-July/011233.html</ref> The same researchers run Fingerprint Central and have designed the test to differ from Panopticlick so it is dedicated to testing discrepancies between Tor Browser instances only. This assists Tor Browser developers test before releases.

== ip-check.info ==

https://ip-check.info -- This site is associated with the [[JonDonym]] anonymizing software and includes common fingerprinting vectors such as IP address, cookies, user agent, browser window dimensions, fonts and so on.

In past forum discussions, users were confused by some false values that were reported by the test; see footnote. <ref>[https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7319 ip-check.info some false values and confuses TBB users]. ([http://archive.is/aVliQ w])</ref> Complete faith cannot be placed in the browser test, since ip-check.info is not free/Libre/open source software ([https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=8191 source]), which means it is unlikely others can fix the test code. Further, since the test service is hosted by an alternative anonymizing network ([https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net JonDonym]) with an associated [https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/jondofox.html JonDoFox] anonymous browser  -- a potential alternative to Tor / Tor Browser -- it is impossible to rule out biased results related to financial incentives (premium accounts).

== Panopticlick ==

Panopticlick was first launched in 2010. It is designed to gather information about common identifiers such as operating system version, browser, plugins and so on and compare it against a central database of many other Internet users' configurations. In addition, it tests tracker blocker effectiveness including tools like AdBlock, Disconnect and Ghostery. <ref>https://panopticlick.eff.org/about</ref>

To learn more about [https://panopticlick.eff.org/ EFF's panopticlick test] and what it signifies for Tor Browser, refer to the following blog post by The Tor Project: [https://blog.torproject.org/blog/effs-panopticlick-and-torbutton EFF's Panopticlick and Torbutton].

User are requested not to post any "Sorry. You are not using Tor." questions in the {{project name}} forums unless certain it is not a false positive. If this message appears, it is unnecessary to be concerned since:
* {{project name}} is designed to tunnel everything over Tor.
* https://check.torproject.org (<code>check.tpo</code>) sometimes fails to detect Tor exit relays. This is a bug in <code>check.tpo</code>, which only The Tor Project can fix.
* Previous reports were IP addresses unassociated with the user's real, external, clearnet IP address. To discover your clearnet (non-Whonix) IP address, visit one of the sites on this page from the host or a non-Tor virtual machine.
* ExoneraTor can be accessed with Tor Browser on the host. {{ExoneraTor}}
