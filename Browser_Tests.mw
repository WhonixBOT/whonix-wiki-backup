http://ip-check.info

* Forum thread, "[https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7319 ip-check.info some false values and confuses TBB users]".
* Possibly biased test service hosted by [https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net JonDonym] that wants to spread [https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/jondofox.html JonDoFox] and by extension sell [https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/premium.html premium accounts]?
* ip-check.info is not Free/Libre/Open Source Software. ([https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=8191 source]) So someone else fixing it is unlikely.
