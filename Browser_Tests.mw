= Interpreting Test Results =

Sites like <code>whoer.net</code> or <code>ip-check.info</code> are unable to adequately assess and demonstrate how anonymity is achieved with [[Tor Browser]]. These sites generally check for various browser characteristics as well as enabled functionality to reveal specific identifiers. Many of these identifiers require JavaScript, but reports commonly include elements like HTTP headers and attributes, the User Agent, numerous JavaScript attributes, IP address, operating system indicators, browser plugins, cookies, cache, browser window dimensions, fonts and so on. If these elements are enabled/activated, then the browser test sites provide more fine-grained results -- although the [https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/ Tor Browser design] has already taken many into account.

Tor Browser developers have carefully considered [https://2019.www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#identifier-linkability Cross-Origin Identifier Unlinkability] and [https://2019.www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#fingerprinting-linkability Cross-Origin Fingerprinting Unlinkability] defenses in their design. Efforts are focused upon:
* First party isolation of all browser identifier sources (such as cookies, cache etc.) by browser tab. These are deleted after closing the browser, but are saved temporarily while the browser is open so most sites are accessible.
* Specific fingerprinting defenses such as disabling browser plugins, preventing HTML5 data extraction, preventing access to the local host and WebRTC API, resizing browser windows to specific dimensions, and many more.

A fundamental principle to improve anonymity is to make all users appear as uniform (similar) as possible, thereby greatly reducing the effectiveness of tracking efforts by various websites and network observers who rely on identifiers.

= Making Browsers Safer =
Browser fingerprinting defenses are not perfect yet.{{Browser_Fingerprinting_Footnote}} There are certainly too few volunteers working on seriously testing browsers and defeating browser fingerprinting. The key word is seriously.

== Fingerprint Central ==
 
[https://fpcentral.tbb.torproject.org/ Fingerprint Central] is the successor to the https://fpcentral.irisa.fr website which now appears defunct. The original code is still [https://github.com/plaperdr/fp-central found on GitHub] and can be run locally to help Tor Browser developers rapidly create prototype defenses. <ref>https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2016-July/011233.html</ref> The same researchers run Fingerprint Central and have designed the test to differ from Panopticlick so it is dedicated to testing discrepancies between Tor Browser instances only. This assists Tor Browser developers test before releases.

== ip-check.info ==
https://ip-check.info

* Forum thread, "[https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7319 ip-check.info some false values and confuses TBB users]". ([http://archive.is/aVliQ w])
* Possibly biased test service hosted by [https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net JonDonym] that wants to spread [https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/jondofox.html JonDoFox] and by extension sell [https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/premium.html premium accounts]?
* ip-check.info is not Free/Libre/Open Source Software. ([https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=8191 source]) So someone else fixing it is unlikely.

* Please don't post any "Sorry. You are not using Tor." questions unless you are really sure it is not a false positive.
* Most likely a false positive.
** When you see this when using {{project_name}}, probably everything is okay. You can make sure everything is okay if you want.
** https://check.torproject.org (<code>check.tpo</code>) fails in some cases to detect Tor exit relays. It is a bug in <code>check.tpo</code>, which The Tor Project should fix. {{project name}} can do nothing about it.
** If it is not your real external clearnet IP address, then there is no need for concern. You can find out your real external clearnet IP address by visiting some IP check website from your host or a non-Tor virtual machine.
**  {{ExoneraTor}} Use it. (using Tor Browser on the host)
