= Interpreting Test Results =
Sites like whoer.net or ip-check.info are unable to really understand and show the way anonymity is accomplished when using the [[Tor Browser]]. What these sites do, is check whether things like cache, cookies, and perhaps [https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/ others] are enabled. If so, they give better results, as to when they are activated.

In the case of Tor Browser, it has the goal to separate cache, cookies, [https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/ etc.] by browser tab. And things are deleted after closing the browser. The thing is, that instead of making it impossible for sites to safe data temporarily, this is allowed, as to make using most sites possible in the first place. To still guarantee anonymity, it's the goal to make everyone using the TBB appear the same, thus rendering tracking based on the things these websites show you pointless.

= Making Browsers Safer =
Browser fingerprinting defenses are not perfect yet.{{Browser_Fingerprinting_Footnote}} There are certainly too few volunteers working on seriously testing browsers and defeating browser fingerprinting. The key word is seriously.

* Please don't post any "Sorry. You are not using Tor." questions unless you are really sure it is not a false positive.
* Most likely a false positive.
** When you see this when using Whonix, probably everything is okay. You can make sure everything is okay if you want.
** https://check.torproject.org (<code>check.tpo</code>) fails in some cases to detect Tor exit relays. It's a bug in <code>check.tpo</code>, which The Tor Project should fix. Whonix can do nothing about it.
** If it is not your real external clearnet IP address, then there is no need for concern. You can find out your real external clearnet IP address by visiting some IP check website from your host or a non-Tor virtual machine.
**  {{ExoneraTor}} Use it. (using the Tor Browser Bundle on the host)

* Possibly biased test service hosted by [https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net JonDonym] that wants to spread [https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/jondofox.html JonDoFox] and by extension sell [https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/premium.html premium accounts]?
* ip-check.info is not Free/Libre/Open Source Software. ([https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=8191 source]) So someone else fixing it is unlikely.
