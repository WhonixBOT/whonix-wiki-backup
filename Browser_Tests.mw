'''UNFINISHED!'''

= Interpreting Test Results =
Sites like whoer.net or ip-check.info are unable to really understand and show the way anonymity is accomplished when using the [[Tor Browser]]. What these sites do, is check whether things like cache, cookies, and perhaps [https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/ others] are enabled. If so, they give better results, as to when they are activated.

In the case of Tor Browser, it has the goal to separate cache, cookies, [https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/ etc.] by browser tab. And things are deleted after closing the browser. The thing is, that instead of making it impossible for sites to safe data temporarily, this is allowed, as to make using most sites possible in the first place. To still guarantee anonymity, it's the goal to make everyone using the TBB appear the same, thus rendering tracking based on the things these websites show you pointless.

= Making Browsers Safer =

= ip-check.info =
http://ip-check.info

* Forum thread, "[https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7319 ip-check.info some false values and confuses TBB users]".
* Possibly biased test service hosted by [https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net JonDonym] that wants to spread [https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/jondofox.html JonDoFox] and by extension sell [https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/premium.html premium accounts]?
* ip-check.info is not Free/Libre/Open Source Software. ([https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=8191 source]) So someone else fixing it is unlikely.

= Other Services =
