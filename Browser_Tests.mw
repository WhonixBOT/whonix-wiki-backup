'''UNFINISHED!'''

= Interpreting Test Results =
Sites like whoer.net or ip-check.info are unable to really understand and show the way anonymity is accomplished when using the [[Tor Browser]]. What these sites do, is check whether things like cache, cookies, and perhaps [https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/ others] are enabled. If so, they give better results, as to when they are activated.

In the case of Tor Browser, it has the goal to separate cache, cookies, [https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/ etc.] by browser tab. And things are deleted after closing the browser. The thing is, that instead of making it impossible for sites to safe data temporarily, this is allowed, as to make using most sites possible in the first place. To still guarantee anonymity, it's the goal to make everyone using the TBB appear the same, thus rendering tracking based on the things these websites show you pointless.

= Making Browsers Safer =
Browser fingerprinting defenses are not perfect yet.{{Browser_Fingerprinting_Footnote}} There are certainly too few volunteers working on seriously testing browsers and defeating browser fingerprinting. The key word is seriously.

When you are reading this page, it may be safe to make the assumption, that you are interested to be more anonymous, i.e. to be less unique. If you are willing to seriously look into these issues - by all means - please help according to your skills. Testing, bug reporting or even bug fixing. If you are new to this stuff, you likely will require at least half an hour per identifier to learn, if the result you found on a browser test website is a:

* false positive
* regression
* known issue or
* unknown issue.

What however is not helpful at all is asking questions in forums, issue trackers and on mailing lists all over the place with stuff that has already been disused, that are either known issues or false positives. Please search first. Otherwise that would only worsen the noise to signal ratio and hinder actual improvement. You don't want this, otherwise this would violate the above assumption.

If you consider it a Whonix specific issue, please make sure you have understood [[Support#Free_Support_Principle|Whonix Free Support Principle]] first.

= ip-check.info =
http://ip-check.info

* Forum thread, "[https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7319 ip-check.info some false values and confuses TBB users]".
* Possibly biased test service hosted by [https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net JonDonym] that wants to spread [https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/jondofox.html JonDoFox] and by extension sell [https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/premium.html premium accounts]?
* ip-check.info is not Free/Libre/Open Source Software. ([https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=8191 source]) So someone else fixing it is unlikely.
