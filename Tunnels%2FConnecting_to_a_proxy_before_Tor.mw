Before combining Tor with other tunnels, [[Tunnels/Introduction | make sure you read and understand the introduction]].

This pages shows how to connect to a proxy before Tor (User -> proxy -> Tor -> Internet).

=== Proxy Warning ===

| text       = '''<u>Warning!</u>'''
There are issues you should be aware of when using standard, common http(s)/socks4(a)/5 proxies. (Anonymizers that only use http(s)/socks4(a)/5 as an interface<ref>Such as the Tor, [[JonDonym]] or [[I2P]] software.</ref> are exempt.)
* Most problems with these proxies are not caused by Whonix.
* ISP-level adversaries can still determine that the user is connecting to the Tor network.
* Be especially careful with http(s) proxies. Some of them send the "[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN#VPNSSHversusProxy http forwarded for]" header which discloses your IP. Http(s) proxies that do not send this header are sometimes called "elite" or "anonymous" proxies.
* When using "http forwarded for" http(s) proxies, Tor entry guards and Tor [[Bridges|bridges]] can determine your IP.

=== Configure Whonix-Gateway ===
Tor natively supports proxy settings and only requires editting the torrc file.

{{Open /etc/tor/torrc}}

Depending on your proxy configuration, add the settings you'll need to your {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}. For more information on these settings, have a look in the [https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en Tor manual] and read the [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorFAQ#MyInternetconnectionrequiresanHTTPorSOCKSproxy. FAQ].

'''Note:''' You need to use the IP instead of the hostname (proxy.example.com). If you don't know the IP of your proxy, please run {{Code|nslookup proxy.example.com}} (replace proxy.example.com with the hostname of your actual proxy) in a terminal (Konsole) on your host operating system. Using IP instead of hostname might cause subtle fingerprinting issues, see <ref>https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/94</ref> for more information.
