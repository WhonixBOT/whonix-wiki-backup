=== Proxy Warning ===
{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px|alt={{project_name}} first time users warning]]
| text    = '''<u>Warning!</u>'''
Users should be aware of several issues when using standard, common http(s)/socks4(a)/5 proxies (anonymizers that only use http(s)/socks4(a)/5 as an interface<ref>Such as the Tor, [[JonDonym]] or [[I2P]] software.</ref> are exempt).
* Most problems with these proxies are not caused by {{project_name}}.
* Connections to proxies are unencrypted and therefore should not be used to hide Tor use. This is because proxies are a type of tunnel-link which are not VPNs or SSH. However, in certain circumstances proxies might be useful to circumvent censorship if it has been shown to work for the user but are unsuitable for hiding Tor due to lack of encryption.
* If users need to circumvent state-level censorship of the Tor network, then a better solution may be [[Bridges]] or other [[Lantern|alternative]] [[Anon_Connection_Wizard|circumvention]] [[Censorship_Circumvention_Tools|tools]]. <ref>Users in China are [https://web.archive.org/web/20171218203107/https://www.cs.uml.edu/~xinwenfu/paper/Bridge.pdf unlikely to circumvent government censorship] with vanilla bridges, as they are uniformly blocked. That said, anon-connection-wizard configured with the meek-amazon or meek-azure pluggable transport is reported to bypass Chinese censorship in late 2017.</ref>
* Be especially careful with http(s) proxies. Some of them send the "[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN#VPNSSHversusProxy http forwarded for]" header which discloses the IP address. Http(s) proxies that do not send this header are sometimes called "elite" or "anonymous" proxies.
* When using "http forwarded for" http(s) proxies, Tor entry guards and Tor [[Bridges|bridges]] can determine the IP address.
* The unencrypted nature of proxies makes them unsuitable to hide Tor from destination websites. For simple IP logging / IP detection they might work unless they’re http(s) proxies and send the "http forwarded for" header.

=== Proxy Configuration Prerequisites ===
{{mbox
| type      = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = '''Tip:''' In order to configure a proxy, three things must be known:

# where the proxy is running,
# the IP and port of the proxy,
# and what type of proxy is being used.
}}
==== Location of the Running Proxy ====
The location of the running proxy is variable and depends on the user's system. Refer to the following resources for examples:

* Proxy software might run on a remote computer, which is easier to set up.
* Proxy software (such as [[lantern]]) create a proxy tunnel on the local computer.
** [[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]]: [[lantern]] and [[JonDonym#Connecting_to_JonDonym_before_Tor|JonDonym]] examples.
** [[{{non q project name short}}|{{non q project name}}]]: This is not yet fully documented, please [[contribute]].
*** The proxy software must run either,
**** under the linux user account <code>tunnel</code> on {{gateway_product_name}}, <u>or</u>
**** on the host, <u>or</u>
**** in another virtual machine.
*** All of this is [[Unsupported|undocumented]]. Also undocumented:
**** How to autostart custom software after reboot (systemd etc.).
**** Custom proxy software setup example.

==== The Proxy IP and Port ====

* If the proxy IP and port is known, the user can skip this section.
* If the user wants to run custom proxy software on {{gateway_product_name}}, then this is also called <code>localhost</code>. Usually the  proxy IP is <code>127.0.0.1</code>.
* '''Note:''' The user must use the IP instead of the hostname (<code>proxy.example.com</code>). If the proxy IP is unknown, then in a terminal on the host operating system, run (Linux) <code>nslookup proxy.example.com</code> (replace <code>proxy.example.com</code> with the hostname of your actual proxy). Using IP instead of hostname might cause subtle fingerprinting issues, see <ref>https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/{{project_name_short}}/issues/94</ref> for more information.

==== Type of Proxy in Use ====
The user needs to know the proxy type from the following list:
* <code>HTTPProxy</code>
* <code>HTTPSProxy</code>
* <code>Socks4Proxy</code>
* <code>Socks5Proxy</code>

The user must also ascertain whether the proxy requires a username and/or password.

=== Configure {{gateway_product_name}} ===
<code>'''User</code> &rarr; <code>proxy</code> &rarr; <code>Tor</code> &rarr; <code>Internet'''</code>

Tor natively supports proxy settings and only requires editing of the torrc file.

==== Option 1: Use {{Code2|Anon Connection Wizard}} ====

Beginning with {{project_name}} 14, a prefixed proxy can be configured easily using [[Anon_Connection_Wizard|Anon Connection Wizard]].

===== Step 1: Start Anon Connection Wizard =====
{{Start_Anon_Connection_Wizard}}

===== Step 2: Use proxy configuration page =====

</div>

==== Option 2: Manually configure proxy ====

<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">

{{Open /usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf}}

Depending on your proxy configuration, add the settings you'll need to your {{Code2|/usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf}}. For more information on these settings, have a look in the [https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en Tor manual] and read the [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorFAQ#MyInternetconnectionrequiresanHTTPorSOCKSproxy.
