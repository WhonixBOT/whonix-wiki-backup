Based on Debian

This project might migrate to its own domain name. Depends on community interest.

Help wanted!

* Anyone wants to create an installer ISO?
* Hardened Debian will hopefully be available as a TemplateVM for [https://www.qubes-os.org/ Qubes OS].

News:

* developers-only builds: https://download.whonix.org/linux/14.0.0.9.8/ (many usability issues such as missing package <code>usability-misc</code>, therefore missing <code>sudo</code> and such)
