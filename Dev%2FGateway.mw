= {{gateway_product_name}} =

{{gateway_product_name}} MUST NOT be ever used for anything other than running Tor on it.

If this machine is compromised the identity (public IP), all destinations and all clear-text (and onion service) communication over Tor is available to the attacker.

Our first goal in securing the {{gateway_product_name}} is minimizing its attack surface. By installing a "minimal system", the only attack surface to an remote attack is Tor itself, apt-get and tails_htp. You can verify this with netstat.

Security features that do not prevent exploitation but only restrict what exploits can do, such as chrooting or sandboxing, do not make much sense: A compromise of Tor already results in a compromise of everything the user cares about.

Compile time hardening (see [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5024 Bug #5024: compile time hardening of TBB (RELRO, canary, PIE)]) should be done by the Tor package maintainer and is beyond the scope of Whonix.

Debian is a good compromise of security and usability. More secure and hardened Linux or BSD based options do exist but they require too much work and/or maintenance to be considered for Whonix. The [[Dev/Operating System]] design page elaborates on that topic.

Having said this, you are welcome to use your own distro. The {{project name}} design is distro agnostic. You just won't be able to thoughtlessly copy and paste commands or to use the source without modifications.

There was also a Hardened Gentoo based {{gateway_product_name}} (unfinished, experts only! Needs maintainer). See [[HardenedGentooTG]].
