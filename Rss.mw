== Introduction ==

In layman's terms, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS RSS] is a http link that can be used for notifications when an update takes place on a website, like when a blog is posted.

== RSS Reader in {{project name}} ==
A recommendation for a privacy-friendly <ref name=cookies>No cookies.</ref> <ref name=scripts>No scripts.</ref> <ref name=fingerprinting>No fingerprinting.</ref> <ref name=using>Using [[Stream Isolation]].</ref> and user-friendly RSS reader is still being researched. Reader help and suggestions are welcome.

== RSS to Email ==

Recommended knowledge:

* [[Introduction]] to this page
* [[E-Mail|Email]]

For example [https://rssforward.com/ rssforward] (not affiliated with {{project name}} and neither recommended for or against against) is a RSS to email service. At the time of writing there are also free RSS to email services. As free services do not leave a money trail it is easier to use them anonymously.

If you frequently read particular websites (such as a blog) like the {{project name}} News Blog -- as recommended on the Download page in the [[Download#Stay tuned|News]] chapter -- and do not mind the RSS to email service mail provider knowing that you subscribed to that blog, <ref>And potentially others.</ref>, then such a service can be utilized to stay in touch with the latest {{project name}} news.

For better security a new email address can be created with Tor so that it is exclusively used to receive notifications about website updates. Note that the mail provider could spoof the notification mails.

At the moment it is safest to read blogs manually in [[Tor Browser]] or to use a privacy-friendly <ref name=cookies /> <ref name=scripts /> <ref name=fingerprinting /> <ref name=using /> [[#RSS_Reader_in_{{project_name}}|RSS reader inside {{project_name}}]].

== RSS to SMS ==

There are also (free) RSS to SMS services which may be convenient, but they are considered even less anonymous than [[#RSS_to_Email|RSS to email]].
