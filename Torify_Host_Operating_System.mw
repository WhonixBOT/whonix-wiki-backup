= Introduction =
Torification of host operating system traffic depends on which host operating system is being used.

This is mostly [[unsupported]] for now but might be possible in the future -- please [[contribute]].

= Windows =
[[Windows]]: this is unlikely to be developed in the near or longer term without contributions from the {{project_name}} community.

= Qubes =
It is theoretically possible to torify all of Qubes' traffic, but this has not been implemented.

= Based on Debian Hosts / Kicksecure Hosts / Whonix Host =
This has not been implemented yet -- [[Kicksecure]] / Whonix Host is still under development.
