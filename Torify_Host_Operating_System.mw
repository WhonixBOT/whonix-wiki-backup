= Introduction =
Torification of host operating system traffic depends on which host operating system is being used.

Mostly [[unsupported]] for now. Might be possible in future. Please [[contribute]].

= Windows =
[[Windows]]: this probably won't be happening soon. Low likelihood of ever happening.

= Qubes =
Doable in theory to torify all of Qubes traffic but not implemented

= Based on Debian Hosts / Kicksecure Hosts / Whonix Host =
It's not yet implemented. [[Kicksecure]] / Whonix Host development hasn't finished yet.
