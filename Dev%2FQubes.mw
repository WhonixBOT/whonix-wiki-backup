I don't know how rpm packaging works. However, the TorVM rpm packaging seems simpler to me and introduce less overhead than Debian packaging at first view. Is there something like config-package-dev for Fedora? config-package-dev is a package to overtake ownership of other
> package's files. Such as, in Debian the Tor package owns /usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc. Whonix needs to modify that file and keep it updated. config-package-dev can be used to avoid getting the file being overwritten when upstream releases and upgrade. Is there something like this for Fedora or is this even required? That would make a port much simpler, because for many parts, it's just diverted config files.

qubes-tor pacakages provides own config file (tor --defaults-torrc option used), so no need to override the one provided by tor package.

But to answer your question - no, rpm do not have option to take ownership of files from other packages, but to workaround this (rather sensible) limitation you can modify the config in triggers (so the file will be modified after each original package update).

Qubes uses non-fixed LAN IPs? How do internal LAN IPs get assigned to TorVM / AppVMs?

QubesVm IP address is generated based on its netvm ID (subnet number) and the said VM static ID, so unless user is switching netvm, the IP is pretty static. We've chosen 10.137.<subnet-id>.<vm-id> which is quite exotic so conflicts with real LAN are very rare (even if rather harmless in isolated network).

Can Qubes OS leave VM's clocks untouched and keep time sync to the VM or is there some forced-VM-timesync-with-dom-0 that can not be turned off? In that case, that would be a bad.

Currently time synchronization is done in some silly way: qvm-sync-clock called each 6min from dom0 cron. That tool fetch the current time using
ntpdate in netvm (VM set as clockvm in qubes-prefs), then pass the result to 'date -s' in each VM.

You can disable this mechanism globally by unsetting(*) clockvm (qubes-prefs -s clockvm none).

(*) Which apparently was broken, fix will be included in updates soon.
