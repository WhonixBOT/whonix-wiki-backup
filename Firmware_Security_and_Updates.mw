= Firmware on Personal Computers =

Firmware is generally defined as the type of software that provides control, monitoring and data manipulation of engineered products. <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware</ref> In the case of computers, firmware is held in non-volatile memory devices such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-only_memory ROM], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eprom EPROM] or [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory flash memory] and is associated with: <ref name=Firmware_comp>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware#Personal_computers</ref> <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware#Examples</ref> <ref>http://www.darkreading.com/partner-perspectives/intel/raising-the-stakes-when-software-attacks-hardware/a/d-id/1319423</ref> <ref>https://www.fsf.org/campaigns/priority-projects/hardware-firmware-drivers</ref>

= Firmware Updating and Security Problems =

== Introduction ==

The major problem with updating firmware is that it cannot be done automatically in most cases. Therefore, it is difficult to fix functionality or security issues after the hardware has shipped. While utility programs are often available to update BIOS, firmware in other devices is rarely updated and mechanisms for detecting and updating firmware is not standardized. <ref name=Firmware_comp /> 

If firmware can be upgraded, this is usually possible via a program created by the provider. Old firmware should always be saved before upgrading. If the process fails or the newer version performs worse, the process can be reverted. <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware#Flashing</ref> Updating firmware may or may not improve security. On the one hand it may fix vulnerabilities, but on the other  hand an update may introduce a new backdoor. 

Unfortunately most end users must blindly trust the hardware producer, so it probably better to install non-free updates rather than risk being vulnerable to known attacks in the wild. <ref>Also see this debian-security mailing list thread: [https://lists.debian.org/debian-security/2013/09/msg00027.html How secure is an installation with no non-free packages?]</ref> Until these re-writable firmware areas are locked down or the code is open-sourced and vastly simplified, it is likely to remain a rich environment for malicious adversaries. <ref>http://www.darkreading.com/partner-perspectives/intel/raising-the-stakes-when-software-attacks-hardware/a/d-id/1319423</ref> <ref>Mark Shuttleworth, founder of the Ubuntu Linux distribution, has described [http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/1332 proprietary firmware as a security risk], stating "firmware on your device is the NSA's best friend" and calling firmware "a trojan horse of monumental proportions".</ref>

The reality is that advanced adversaries are routinely hacking the firmware of [https://www.wired.com/2013/09/nsa-router-hacking/ Internet routers, switches and firewalls], along with [https://www.wired.com/2015/02/nsa-firmware-hacking/ harddrive firmware], and [https://wikileaks.org/vault7/#Dark%20Matter UEFI/EFI and ethernet adapters]. The number of targets is already in the tens of thousands on an annual basis. Subverting firmware in this manner provides a stealthy and persistent presence that can eavesdrop on or re-route all network data, or access information in invisible storage areas that are unecrypted (bypassing disk encryption). Worst of all, firmware sabotage is believed to survive software updates or complete operating system re-installations. Attacks may also be designed to corrupt firmware so machines are prevented from booting, even with an external drive. <ref>http://www.darkreading.com/partner-perspectives/intel/raising-the-stakes-when-software-attacks-hardware/a/d-id/1319423</ref>

== Supply Chain Attacks ==

Compromising a computing company's infrastructure is an advanced attack methodology that has risen to prominence over the last ten years: <ref name=supply_chain_attack>https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/d3y48v/what-is-a-supply-chain-attack</ref>

<blockquote>Supply chain attacks can happen when hackers gain access to a software company's infrastructure—development environment, build servers, update servers, etc.—and are able to inject malware into new software releases or security updates.</blockquote>

A recent example of malware that successfully targeted computer firmware is the late-2018 "Operation ShadowHammer" attack, which affected an estimated half a million Windows users utilizing ASUS hardware. In this case, the [https://www.shouldiremoveit.com/ASUS-Live-Update-5823-program.aspx ASUS Live Update Utility] -- which is responsible for automatically updating components like BIOS, UEFI, drivers and applications -- was compromised. 

It was discovered that the backdoored utility actually targeted the MAC addresses of a few hundred users, which were actually hard-coded into the trojan samples analyzed. The implication is that an advanced nation state attacker was willing to infect an untold number of innocent users for their targeted operations on a far smaller subset. <ref>https://securelist.com/operation-shadowhammer/89992/</ref> This sophisticated supply chain attack involved several steps:  <ref>https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pan9wn/hackers-hijacked-asus-software-updates-to-install-backdoors-on-thousands-of-computers</ref>

* The ASUS server which served the live update tool was compromised.
* The malicious file was signed with ''legitimate'' ASUS digital certificates so the software appeared genuine. <ref>Reinforcing the notion that digital certificates are an imperfect security mechanism.</ref> The file was actually a three-year old binary containing harmful code.
* Users downloaded the malicious, backdoored utility through the ASUS update server.
* The trojan utility searched for targets using a set of unique MAC addresses. <ref>MD5 hash values were hard-coded and found to correspond to unique MAC addresses for network adapter cards. This indicates the attackers knew the MAC addresses of their targets in advance.</ref>
* Once located, a command-and-control server under the attacker's control installed additional malware on the machine.

This attack is concerning because it reveals adversaries are prepared to undermine the security underpinning the entire supply chain for their purposes, whether it is manufactured/assembled components or via breaches of trusted vendor software channels. As most users of specific computer hardware trust the manufacturing company, this is a very difficult problem to address, particularly since it can remain undiscovered for a long period. 

In addition, this mode of attack suggests that overall improvements in computing security are forcing sophisticated attackers to "raise their game," because in general they choose the path of least resistance when attempting to infiltrate the systems of targets. <ref name=supply_chain_attack />
