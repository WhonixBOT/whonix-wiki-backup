Due to the difficulty of this topic and the specificity of hardware and host OS firmware, this issue is generally outside the scope of Whonix documentation. The links provided further below may not be the most relevant to the end user, necessitating further individual research.

= Firmware on Personal Computers =

Firmware is generally defined as the type of software that provides control, monitoring and data manipulation of engineered products. <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware</ref> In the case of computers, firmware is held in non-volatile memory devices such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-only_memory ROM], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eprom EPROM] or [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory flash memory] and is associated with: <ref name=Firmware_comp>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware#Personal_computers</ref> <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware#Examples</ref> <ref>http://www.darkreading.com/partner-perspectives/intel/raising-the-stakes-when-software-attacks-hardware/a/d-id/1319423</ref> <ref>https://www.fsf.org/campaigns/priority-projects/hardware-firmware-drivers</ref>

= Firmware Updating and Security Problems =
== Introduction ==
The major problem with updating firmware is that it cannot be done automatically in most cases. Therefore, it is difficult to fix functionality or security issues after the hardware has shipped. While utility programs are often available to update BIOS, firmware in other devices is rarely updated and mechanisms for detecting and updating firmware is not standardized. <ref name=Firmware_comp /> 

If firmware can be upgraded, this is usually possible via a program created by the provider. Old firmware should always be saved before upgrading. If the process fails or the newer version performs worse, the process can be reverted. <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware#Flashing</ref> Updating firmware may or may not improve security. On the one hand it may fix vulnerabilities, but on the other  hand an update may introduce a new backdoor. 

Unfortunately most end users must blindly trust the hardware producer, so it probably better to install non-free updates rather than risk being vulnerable to known attacks in the wild. <ref>Also see this debian-security mailing list thread: [https://lists.debian.org/debian-security/2013/09/msg00027.html How secure is an installation with no non-free packages?]</ref> Until these re-writable firmware areas are locked down or the code is open-sourced and vastly simplified, it is likely to remain a rich environment for malicious adversaries. <ref>http://www.darkreading.com/partner-perspectives/intel/raising-the-stakes-when-software-attacks-hardware/a/d-id/1319423</ref> <ref>Mark Shuttleworth, founder of the Ubuntu Linux distribution, has described [http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/1332 proprietary firmware as a security risk], stating "firmware on your device is the NSA's best friend" and calling firmware "a trojan horse of monumental proportions".</ref>

The reality is that advanced adversaries are routinely hacking the firmware of [https://www.wired.com/2013/09/nsa-router-hacking/ Internet routers, switches and firewalls], along with [https://www.wired.com/2015/02/nsa-firmware-hacking/ harddrive firmware], and [https://wikileaks.org/vault7/#Dark%20Matter UEFI/EFI and ethernet adapters]. The number of targets is already in the tens of thousands on an annual basis. Subverting firmware in this manner provides a stealthy and persistent presence that can eavesdrop on or re-route all network data, or access information in invisible storage areas that are unecrypted (bypassing disk encryption). Worst of all, firmware sabotage is believed to survive software updates or complete OS re-installations. Attacks may also be designed to corrupt firmware so machines are prevented from booting, even with an external drive. <ref>http://www.darkreading.com/partner-perspectives/intel/raising-the-stakes-when-software-attacks-hardware/a/d-id/1319423</ref>
