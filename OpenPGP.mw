= Introduction =

OpenPGP is: <ref>https://www.openpgp.org/about/</ref> <ref>https://www.openpgp.org/</ref>
<blockquote>... a non-proprietary protocol for encrypting email communication using public key cryptography. It is based on the original PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) software. The OpenPGP protocol defines standard formats for encrypted messages, signatures, and certificates for exchanging public keys.</blockquote>

<blockquote>OpenPGP is the most widely used email encryption standard. ... OpenPGP was originally derived from the PGP software, created by [https://philzimmermann.com/ Phil Zimmermann].</blockquote>

The primary purpose of OpenPGP relates to end-to-end encrypted email communication, but it is also utilized for encrypted messaging, password managers and other use cases. OpenPGP provides support for all major operating systems like Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux, Android and iOS. The openPGP standard was proposed to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and accepted as a standard in 1997. The standard has been continuously improved since that time and there is no suggestion intelligence agencies can break it. <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy#OpenPGP</ref>

OpenPGP has an impressive resume and a host of applications, developer libraries and miscellaneous tools have implemented the OpenPGP standard either directly or with additional software. Applicable domains include:
* <u>[https://www.openpgp.org/software/ Email encryption]</u>: for various platforms, browser plugins, webmail providers with browser plugins, and webmail providers with in-browser cryptography
* <u>[https://www.openpgp.org/software/server/ Server software]</u>: webmail clients, keyservers, mailing list software and password managers
* <u>[https://www.openpgp.org/software/developer/ Developer libraries]</u>: various OpenPGP libraries, libraries supporting OpenPGP smartcards, and developer tools
* <u>[https://www.openpgp.org/software/misc/ Miscellaneous tools]</u>: web-based tools and other applications

PGP has very bad usability and cryptography. Common PGP clients such as GnuPG are also not very secure. Thus, it is recommended against by many cryptography experts.

If you want to be extra cautious and really authenticate a OpenPGP key in a stronger way than what standard HTTPS offers you, you could use the OpenPGP Web of Trust.

One of the inherent problems of standard HTTPS is that the trust we usually put on a website is defined by certificate authorities: a hierarchical and closed set of companies and governmental institutions approved by web browser vendors. This model of trust has long been criticized and proved several times to be vulnerable to attacks [[Warning|as explained on our warning page]].

We believe instead that users should be given the final say when trusting a website, and that designation of trust should be done on the basis of human interaction.

The OpenPGP [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust Web of Trust] is a decentralized trust model based on OpenPGP keys. Let's see that with an example.

''You're a friend of Alice and really trust her way of managing OpenPGP keys. You've validated Alice's key.''

''Furthermore, Alice met Bob in a conference, and signed Bob's key.''

This scenario creates a trust path from you to Bob's key that could allow you to validate it without having to depend on certificate authorities.

This trust model is not perfect either and requires both caution and intelligent supervision by users. The technical details of creating, managing and trusting OpenPGP keys are outside of the scope of this document.

We also acknowledge that not everybody might be able to create good trust path since it based on a network of direct human relationships and the knowledge of quite complex tools such as GnuPG.
}}

== Bootstrapping OpenPGP Keys from the Internet ==
Some OpenPGP users are unsure how to stay totally anonymous or what steps to take if there is no trusted path to an OpenPGP key. 

Some people just write an unencrypted mail to the recipient and ask them to send their public key. The recipient will most likely either send their public key or at least its fingerprint.

This method works against passive attacks since an observer will not know what has been discussed in the following encrypted mails. However, this method totally fails against active attacks. A [[Warning#Man-in-the-middle_Attacks|man-in-the-middle]] could replace the recipient's key with their own malicious key. The sender would then use the wrong key, the man-in-the-middle would decrypt the message, read it, and re-encrypt it with the legitimate key and forward it to the recipient. Neither the sender nor recipient would ever discover that their messages were being read by an adversary. This is the whole reason why the trust model path and key signing is recommended in the first place.

As an alternative, some people also publish their OpenPGP fingerprint or their OpenPGP public key on their personal or other websites. This method is more secure if the website is accessible over TLS -- even more so when both server and client are using [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security HSTS] (and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions DNSSEC]) -- and/or as an [[Onion_Services#How_Onion_Services_Connections_Work|onion service]] with a <code>.onion</code> domain. Of course, this presupposes the visitor is aware what kind of transportation mechanism is provided. In this case, the adversary would have to:
* break the TLS or onion encryption where someone wants to obtain the key or fingerprint; or 
* compromise the server
Depending on the adversary this may take more resources. It should be noted that both the public CA system of TLS and Tor onion services have security issues; see [[SSL|TLS]] and [[Onion_Services#Onion_Services_Security|Onion Services Security]] for further information.

Based on the preceding discussion, it is safest if the same website is accessible over both http'''s''' and <code>.onion</code>. This configuration allows the user to visit both sites and then check if the OpenPGP fingerprint/key results match.

To further improve the situation the key holder can spread its fingerprint and/or OpenPGP key to other websites. Some key holders attach their OpenPGP fingerprint to their email signature (a short attachment to any mail) and to public mailing lists they are participating in. This behavior makes it difficult for an adversary to successfully spoof all these information avenues. Spreading the fingerprint and/or key in various domains is only helpful if the person searching is either aware of that fact or has undertaken research on their own initiative.

'''Why aren't the SKS keyserver wiki steps always functional?'''

The SKS keyserver network has recently come under attack after a critical vulnerability was discovered which allows certificates to be spammed using a flaw in the OpenPGP protocol itself. Future releases of OpenPGP software will likely mitigate this flaw, but high profile contributors to the protocol suggest that data should not be retrieved form the network at present if possible. For more details, see [https://gist.github.com/rjhansen/67ab921ffb4084c865b3618d6955275f here]. <ref>New, experimental keyservers have been established which afford protection against this attack.</ref> <ref>The author notes the potential downsides of this attack: <blockquote>
* If you fetch a poisoned certificate from the keyserver network, you will break your GnuPG installation.
* Poisoned certificates cannot be deleted from the keyserver network.
* The number of deliberately poisoned certificates, currently at only a few, will only rise over time.
* We do not know whether the attackers are intent on poisoning other certificates.
* We do not even know the scope of the damage.</blockquote></ref>
-----
'''Is the OpenPGP keyserver part of the SKS pool?'''

The [https://keys.openpgp.org/about/faq OpenPGP keyserver FAQ] notes: 
<blockquote>No. The federation model of the SKS pool has various problems in terms of reliability, abuse-resistance, privacy, and usability. We might do something similar to it, but keys.openpgp.org will never be part of the SKS pool itself.</blockquote>
