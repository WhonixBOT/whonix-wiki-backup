== KVM ==
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Back-up your data.

Either move important files via [[KVM#Shared_Folders|shared folders]] or make a full clone of VMs in each snapshot state in case something goes wrong.

'''2.''' On the host: Delete all existing snapshots.

'''3.''' On the host: Increase the disk size.

<code>1G</code> below should be replaced with the amount of memory to be added in gigabytes.

{{CodeSelect|code=
qemu-img resize vmdisk.img +1G
}}

'''4.''' Boot up and check if it is still working. 

'''5.''' Install GParted in {{workstation_product_name}} and resize the filesystem to claim the newly added space.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install gparted
}}
}}

== VirtualBox ==
In case more disk space is required for your virtual hard disk, the good news is that you are still a [[VirtualBox]] user. {{project name}} is nothing special; it is just another VM image. Any suggestions you find for VirtualBox will similarly work for {{project_name}}. [[Free Support Principle]] applies.

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' On the host: Make a clone of all states of your existing virtual machine in case something goes wrong.

'''2.''' On the host: Delete all existing VM snapshots.

'''3.''' On the host: Grow the disk.

Using the VirtualBox graphical user interface (GUI) (new method):

VirtualBox -> File -> Virtual Media Manager -> select virtual hdd -> adjust the size slider

Using command line (old method):

Find the folder of your virtual hdd.

Run the following command. Notes:

* Adjust the filename of the virtual hdd.
* Adjust <code>100000</code> to for example <code>200000</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
VBoxManage modifyhd "{{workstation_product_name_short}}-disk1.vdi" --resize 100000
}}

'''5.''' Boot up and check if it is still working.

'''6.''' Up to this point only the physical size was increased, but the filesystem has not been changed. Shut down again.

'''7.''' Inside VM: You have to boot from a boot CD (Ubuntu Precise *DVD* did work) and use a tool like <code>gparted</code> to grow the filesystem.

Start a terminal.

{{CodeSelect|code=
lxsudo gparted
}}

This is likely also possible using the command line in [[Recovery|recovery mode]]. [[Undocumented]].

'''8.''' Inside VM: Increase the size of the filesystem. Apply and shut down.

The procedure is complete.
