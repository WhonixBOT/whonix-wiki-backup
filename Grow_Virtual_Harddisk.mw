== KVM ==
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Back-up your data.

Either move your important files via [[KVM#Shared_Folders|shared folders]] or make a full clone of your VM in each snapshot state in case something goes wrong.

'''2.''' On the host: Delete all existing snapshots.

'''3.''' On the host: Increase the disk size.

<code>1G</code> below needs to be replaced with the amount of memory you would like to add in gigabytes.

{{CodeSelect|code=
qemu-img resize vmdisk.img +1G
}}

'''4.''' Boot up and check if it is still working. 

'''5.''' Install GParted in {{workstation_product_name}} and resize the filesystem to claim the newly added space.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install gparted
}}
}}
== VirtualBox ==
In case more disk space is required for your virtual hard disk, the good news is that you are still a [[VirtualBox]] user. {{project name}} is nothing special; it is just another VM image. Any suggestions you find for VirtualBox will similarly work for {{project_name}}. [[Free Support Principle]] applies.

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' On the host: Make a clone of all states of your existing virtual machine in case something goes wrong.

'''2.''' On the host: Delete all existing VM snapshots.

'''3.''' On the host: Find the folder of your virtual hdd.

'''4.''' On the host: Grow the disk.

{{CodeSelect|code=
VBoxManage modifyhd "{{workstation_product_name_short}}-disk1.vdi" --resize 100000
}}

'''5.''' Boot up and check if it is still working.

'''6.''' Up to this point only the physical size was increased, but the filesystem has not been changed. Shut down again.

'''7.''' Inside VM: You have to boot from a boot cd (Ubuntu Precise *DVD* did work) and use a tool like gparted to grow the filesystem. 

Start a terminal.

{{CodeSelect|code=
lxsudo gparted
}}

'''8.''' Inside VM: Increase the filesystem. Apply and shut down.

The procedure is complete.
