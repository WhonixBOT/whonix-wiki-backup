= Rationale = 

Although systemcheck already has apparmor and systemd hardening, some marginal security and anonymity benefits are gained by reducing: the number of network connections, the amount of code running, and [[Advanced_Host_Security#Attack_Surface_Reduction|unnecessary functionality]]. This is not the default configuration, since that would come at the cost of decreased usability for the entire {{project_name}} population.

= Hardening Steps =

== Prevent Autostart ==

To prevent systemcheck from automatically starting, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl mask systemcheck
}}

{{Anchor|Prevent Downloading {{project_name}} News}}

{{Anchor|Prevent_Downloading_Whonix_.E2.84.A2_News_and_Whonix_.E2.84.A2_User_Census_Counting}}

{{Anchor|Prevent {{project_name}} User Census Counting}}
== Prevent {{project_name}} Warrant Canary Check and User Census Counting ==

Refer to the following [[systemcheck]] chapters:

* [[Whonixcheck#Warrant_Canary_Check|Warrant Canary Check]]; and
* [[Whonixcheck#Disable_Warrant_Canary_Check|Disable Warrant Canary Check]].

== Prevent Polluting TransPort ==
{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = <br />
* {{workstation_product_name}} only.
* This is only useful when running <code>systemcheck --leak-tests</code>. However, running this command with the Tor <code>TransPort</code> test disabled makes little sense; in that case it would be useful as a Tor <code>SocksPort</code> connectivity test.
}}

Deactivate the <code>TransPort</code> Test for better [[Stream Isolation]].

{{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/systemcheck.d/50_user.conf
}}

Add the following content.

{{CodeSelect|code=
SYSTEMCHECK_DISABLE_TRANS_PORT_TEST="1"
}}

Save.

== Prevent Running apt-get ==

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = Complete these steps on ''both'' {{gateway_product_name}} and {{workstation_product_name}}.
}}

This prevents the running of apt-get by systemcheck.

{{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/systemcheck.d/50_user.conf
}}

Add the following content.

{{CodeSelect|code=
systemcheck_skip_functions+=" check_operating_system "
}}

== Prevent torproject.org Connections ==

Connections to The Tor Project are prevented by default, therefore no action is required.

systemcheck only connects to <code>torproject.org</code> if the command <code>systemcheck --leak-tests</code> is manually run.
