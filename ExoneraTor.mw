{{ExoneraTor}} The homepage states:
<blockquote>The ExoneraTor service maintains a database of IP addresses that have been part of the Tor network.  It answers the question whether there was a Tor relay running on a given IP address on a given date.  ExoneraTor may store more than one IP address per relay if relays use a different IP address for exiting to the Internet than for registering in the Tor network, and it stores whether a relay permitted transit of Tor traffic to the open Internet at that time.</blockquote>
