= Peer-to-Peer (P2P) File Sharing =
File Sharing Clients such as torrent, eMule, etc.

== Please limit! ==
Whonix will keep your IP address hidden while you use BitTorrent and other file sharing and P2P programs. However, because the Tor network suffers from limited bandwidth shared among many users, please be aware of how much you are downloading and uploading with these programs: A single 500 megabyte media file can equal hours of browsing for another user.

Violation of copyright laws risks harassment against exit nodes. To learn more about legal protections for file sharing in your country, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_aspects_of_file_sharing

If you must use it, please disable torrent seeding, as the constant uploading is what makes resource usage particularly harmful to the network compared to ordinary downloads over FTP/HTTP.

== The Tor Project ==
The Tor Project has yet to make a definite, official statement about the use of BitTorrent over the Tor network.

Quote [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2011-December/022376.html Jacob Appelbaum]:

<blockquote>''[...] I'm not clear that it will harm the network if Tails includes a BitTorrent client. I think that the harm comes when someone runs a few seeding boxes through Tor and doesn't bother to add any capacity to the network at all. [...]''
</blockquote>

Quote [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2011-December/022369.html Andrew Lewman says]:

<blockquote>''[...] There are completely legitimate uses of bittorrent over Tor. I've talked to people who want to get their ISO of Fedora or Ubuntu from outside their country, so they bt over tor to do so. [...] I'm fully aware that the tor codebase punishes me for doing large downloads over Tor, so be it. [...]''
</blockquote>

Quote: [https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea Roger Dingledine]:

<blockquote>''[...] We've been saying for years not to run Bittorrent over Tor, because the Tor network [https://blog.torproject.org/blog/why-tor-is-slow can't handle the load]; [...]''
</blockquote>

== Bittorrent Client Fingerprinting ==

On initial startup, torrent clients generate a unique peer ID for the DHT network.<ref>https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/37167/can-bittorrent-clients-be-fingerprinted</ref> Also apparently the trackers can set cookies in the client as a newer version of qbittorrent allows you to see and manage those from the GUI. To avoid leaving a long lived trail of download activity, it is recommended to periodically start fresh from a clean snapshot and reinstall the torrent client.
