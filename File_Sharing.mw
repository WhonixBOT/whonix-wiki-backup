== Please don't! ==

Even though p2p over Whonix is anonymous it is still discouraged. It's slow. Tor is not really designed for it and file sharing through Tor puts excessive load on nodes because it opens hundreds of new circuits. Don't be lame, the exit relay admins get trouble and may shut their node, at the cost of all of us.

== Alternative ==

In many locations and in many places a VPN is safe enough for sharing software, which is not supposed to be shared. You are discouraged from violating your local laws.

== Limited Damage Control ==

If you decided to be lame and use Tor for file sharing, please add a VPN behind Tor, i.e. Tor -> VPN -> filesharing network. This will at least protect the Tor exit relays from abuse complaints and may result in faster download speed as well. (Because of [[Tunnel UDP over Tor]]) See [[Tunnel_Proxy_or_SSH_or_VPN_through_Tor]] (user -> Tor -> Proxy/SSH/VPN)].

You have already decided to leech from the Tor network. Please also consider leeching from the file sharing network. 1. Disable uploading/sharing: this reduces load from the Tor network and may also result in faster download speeds. Or 2. Lower upload rate to the absolute minimum required. 3. Remove the files/torrent file from your shared folder and remove the entry from your p2p client (or better, close the p2p client) after finishing downloading: this ensures the file no longer uses up bandwidth and gets shared.

<blockquote>''[...] I'm not clear that it will harm the network if Tails includes a BitTorrent client. I think that the harm comes when someone runs a few seeding boxes through Tor and doesn't bother to add any capacity to the network at all. [...]''

<blockquote>''[...] There are completely legitimate uses of bittorrent over Tor. I've talked to people who want to get their ISO of Fedora or Ubuntu from outside their country, so they bt over tor to do so.
