[https://www.torproject.org/download/ Tor Browser] <ref>https://tb-manual.torproject.org/</ref> is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development) fork] of the Mozilla [https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/ Firefox ESR] web browser. It is developed by [https://www.torproject.org/ The Tor Project] and [https://2019.www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/ optimized] and [https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/torbutton/en/design/ designed] for [[Tor]], anonymity and security. <ref>https://blogs.gnome.org/muelli/2018/12/the-patch-that-converts-a-firefox-to-a-tor-browser/</ref> Most will have browsed with Firefox and be familiar with the user interface that resembles those found in other popular, modern browsers. <ref>
A good overview of the browser component is provided by [https://2019.www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#Implementation The Tor Project design document].
<br />
<blockquote>The Tor Browser is based on Mozilla's Extended Support Release (ESR) Firefox branch. We have a series of patches against this browser to enhance privacy and security. Browser behavior is additionally augmented through the Torbutton extension, though we are in the process of moving this functionality into direct Firefox patches. We also change a number of Firefox preferences from their defaults.

Tor process management and configuration is accomplished through the Tor Launcher add-on, which provides the initial Tor configuration splash screen and bootstrap progress bar. Tor Launcher is also compatible with Thunderbird, Instantbird, and XULRunner.

To help protect against potential Tor Exit Node eavesdroppers, we include HTTPS-Everywhere. To provide users with optional defense-in-depth against JavaScript and other potential exploit vectors, we also include NoScript. We also modify several extension preferences from their defaults.

To provide censorship circumvention in areas where the public Tor network is blocked either by IP, or by protocol fingerprint, we include several Pluggable Transports in the distribution. As of this writing, we include Obfs3proxy, Obfs4proxy, Scramblesuit, meek, and FTE.</blockquote>

}}

If browsers other than Tor Browser are used in {{project_name}}, the IP address and Domain Name Service (DNS) requests <ref>{{Code|DNS is a distributed database which keeps track of computer's names and their corresponding IP addresses on the Internet}} https://web.stanford.edu/class/msande91si/www-spr04/readings/week1/InternetWhitepaper.htm.

However, only Tor Browser provides [[#Torbutton|protocol level cleanup]], which includes unique features like proxy obedience, state separation, network isolation, and anonymity set preservation.

In stark contrast to regular browsers, Tor Browser is optimized for anonymity and has a plethora of [https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor-browser.git privacy-enhancing patches] and add-ons. <ref>See below for a further description of these features.</ref> By sharing the [[Fingerprint]] with around [https://metrics.torproject.org/userstats-relay-country.html two million other people], <ref>On average.

= Encryption =
== HTTPS Encryption ==
It is important to understand the difference between HTTP and HTTPS: <ref name=whatishttps>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS</ref>

<blockquote>Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol Hypertext Transfer Protocol] (HTTP). It is used for [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_communications secure communication] over a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_operating_system computer network], and is widely used on the Internet. In HTTPS, the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol communication protocol] is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encrypted encrypted] using [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security Transport Layer Security] (TLS), or, formerly, its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The protocol is therefore also often referred to as HTTP over TLS, or HTTP over SSL. <br />

The principal motivation for HTTPS is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication authentication] of the accessed [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website website] and protection of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy privacy] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity integrity] of the exchanged data while in transit. ...</blockquote>

=== HTTPS Advantages ===

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = Only rely on services providing HTTPS when sensitive information is sent or received. Otherwise, passwords, financial / personal information or other sensitive data can be easily stolen or intercepted by eavesdroppers. HTTP webpage contents can also be modified on their way to the browser for malicious purposes.
}}

HTTPS advantages include: <ref name=whatishttps />
* Authentication of the website and web server that is being communicated with.
* Protection against [[Warning#Man-in-the-middle_Attacks|Man-in-the-middle Attacks]].
* Bidirectional encryption of communications between a client and server. This protects against [[Warning#Tor_Exit_Relays_can_Eavesdrop_on_Communications|eavesdropping]] and tampering with / forging of communication contents.
* A <i>reasonable</i> expectation that the website being communicated with is genuine. <ref>HTTPS is not foolproof due to reliance on the Certificate Authority (CA) system that issues digital certificates (private keys) for websites. As a trusted third party, this trust can be abused or the CAs can be subject to adversary attacks.</ref>

In the Tor Browser context, this means HTTPS should be preferred over HTTP so communication is encrypted while browsing the Internet. While traffic is encrypted throughout the Tor network, the exit relay (third of three servers) can see traffic sent into Tor if it is plain HTTP. If HTTPS is used, the exit relay will only know the destination address. <ref>https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/faq#AmITotallyAnonymous</ref>

As an example, the screenshot below captures the browser appearance when visiting the {{project_name}} website. <ref>https://www.whonix.org</ref>

Take note of the small, left-hand area of the address bar. Indicators of an encrypted connection are  <code>www.whonix.org</code> is highlighted with a padlock and "<span style="color:#008000">Secure Connection</span>" in green writing, and the URL begins with ''https://'' instead of ''http://''

=== HTTP / HTTPS Connections with and without Tor ===

The following figures from EFF provide an overview of HTTP / HTTPS connections with and without Tor, and what information is visible to various third parties. The descriptors are as follows: <ref>https://www.eff.org/pages/tor-and-https</ref>

<blockquote>Potentially visible data includes: the site you are visiting (SITE.COM), your username and password (USER/PW), the data you are transmitting (DATA), your IP address (LOCATION), and whether or not you are using Tor (TOR).</blockquote>

== Onion Services Encryption ==
Whenever possible, utilize [[Onion_Services|Onion Services]] (<code>.onion</code> addresses) so communications and web browsing stay within the Tor network. These resources are still commonly referred to as "hidden services", even when their location is publicly known. <ref>
https://riseup.net/en/security/network-security/tor/onionservices-best-practices
</ref>

=== Onion Services Advantages ===
URLs ending in the <code>.onion</code> extension provide a superior level of security and privacy, since the connection forms a tunnel which is encrypted (end-to-end) using a random rendezvous point within the Tor network; HTTPS is not required. These connections also incorporate [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_forward_secrecy perfect forward secrecy (PFS)]. PFS means the compromise of long-term keys does not compromise past session keys. As a consequence, past encrypted communications and sessions cannot be retrieved and decrypted if long-term secrets keys or passwords are compromised in the future by adversaries. <ref>This does not however defend against improved cryptanalysis that breaks underlying ciphers being used, for example by the emergence of quantum computers. Only post-quantum ciphers resistant to these attacks will prevail.</ref> 

Onion services provide several other benefits: <ref>
https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/onion-services
</ref> 

* Passive surveillance by both network observers and the Tor exit node is prevented, unlike the plain Tor + HTTPS configuration. Adversaries cannot easily determine which destination is being connected from/to.
* Onion services establish "rendezvous points" in the Tor network for web services, meaning neither the hosting service nor the user can discover the other's network identity.
* Onion services can be combined with [[SSL|SSL/TLS]] to provide additional protection. Only a handful of sites currently provide this service with v3 onions, such as DuckDuckGo: https://duckduckgogg42xjoc72x3sjasowoarfbgcmvfimaftt6twagswzczad.onion/ <ref>Tests reveal the v3 onion address defaults to the clearnet search engine if JavaScript is not enabled.</ref> <ref>
Extra layers of encryption are not strictly necessary, since a completely encrypted tunnel is already formed (but it certainly does not hurt). Until recently, these certificates would not validate because of the *.onion hostname.</ref> <ref>https://riseup.net/en/security/network-security/tor/onionservices-best-practices
</ref>
* Onion services do not use the insecure DNS system. Strong authentication comes from the self-authenticating address: the address itself forms a cryptographic proof of the <code>.onion</code>'s identity. <ref>
https://blog.torproject.org/blog/cooking-onions-names-your-onions
</ref> <ref>
This is why onion addresses appear absurdly long and random.
</ref>

= Tor Browser Add-Ons =

== Introduction ==

Any default add-ons that are installed in Tor Browser should not be removed or disabled in the <code>about:addons</code> page. Tor developers have considered the security and anonymity benefits of this configuration, even though [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3007 NoScript blocking is disabled (JavaScript is enabled) in Tor Browser by default] (see footnote). <ref>Experienced Tor developer Mike Perry has noted that even with scripts globally enabled, [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3007#comment:3 NoScript still provides significant protection in Tor Browser]:
<blockquote>We provide NoScript mostly for the non-filter features it provides, such as click-to-play for media, webgl and plugins, XSS protection, remote font blockage, and so on.</blockquote></ref> Developers have reasoned that this helps to avoid feature breakage and focuses efforts on designing a private browsing environment that does not rely on filters.

== HTTPS Everywhere ==

[[File:httpseverywhere.png|150px|HTTPS Everywhere logo|thumb]]

[https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere HTTPS Everywhere] is a Firefox extension shipped in Tor Browser and produced as a collaboration between [https://torproject.org/ The Tor Project] and the [https://eff.org/ Electronic Frontier Foundation]. It helps to encrypt communications with a number of major sites. 

Many sites on the Internet offer some limited support for encryption over HTTPS, but make it difficult to use. For instance, sites may default to unencrypted HTTP or fill encrypted pages with links that return to the unencrypted version of site. The HTTPS Everywhere extension addresses these problems by rewriting all site requests to HTTPS.

To learn more about HTTPS Everywhere, visit:

* The [https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere HTTPS Everywhere homepage].
* The [https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere/faq/ HTTPS Everywhere FAQ].

== NoScript ==

[[Image:noscript.png|NoScript logo|thumb]]

NoScript is a free, open source extension that comes bundled with Tor Browser and other Mozilla-based web browsers. NoScript can provide significant protection with the correct configuration: <ref name=no_script>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoScript</ref>

<blockquote>By default, NoScript blocks active (executable) web content, which a user can wholly or partially unblock by whitelisting a site or domain from the extension's toolbar menu: Sites can be set as 'allowed', 'trusted', or 'untrusted', and the whitelist persists between sessions. Temporarily allowed sites won't by added to the permanent whitelist, and work only until the browser session ends. Active content may consist of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript JavaScript], web fonts, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language) Java], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash Flash], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Silverlight Silverlight], and other [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_(computing) plugins]. The add-on also offers specific countermeasures against security exploits. ... This is based on the assumption that malicious websites can use these technologies in harmful ways.</blockquote>

NoScript protects against [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting cross-site scripting] (XSS), whereby attackers inject malicious client-side scripts into destination web pages, bypassing the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy same-origin policy]. <ref><blockquote>XSS effects vary in range from petty nuisance to significant security risk, depending on the sensitivity of the data handled by the vulnerable site and the nature of any security mitigation implemented by the site's owner.</blockquote></ref> The same-origin policy refers to web browser enforcement of permissions -- scripts in the first web page are usually only allowed to access data in a second web page if they have the same origin (URL scheme, hostname and port number). <ref>[https://noscript.net/faq#clearclick Anti-clickjacking] was previously available to protect against hidden or disguised user interface elements masquerading as trusted web page buttons, links and so on. This is no longer available following the shift to Firefox extensions in Tor Browser based on Firefox 60 ESR. This feature protected against malicious activation of microphones or webcams, as well as user interaction with hidden elements to steal important financial, personal or other data.</ref>

When NoScript is enabled, a host of tracking / profiling services are neutralized because they rely on JavaScript. For example, various operating system and browser configuration details are revealed if JavaScript is not disabled. 
<ref name=no_script /> Another unintended benefit concerns the use of system resources. When JavaScript is disabled, studies reveal that bandwidth consumption can be reduced by more than 40 per cent on the top 150 Alexa websites. Similarly, less system resources are required to display a web page in the browser. <ref>https://ianix.com/pub/firefox-addons-and-bandwidth-consumption.html</ref>

=== Security vs Usability Trade-off ===

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = The [[#Security_Slider|Security Slider]] (see further below) also involves a security versus usability trade-off. Higher slider levels improve security and reduce usability, while the opposite is true of other settings. Fingerprinting risks are greatly reduced at higher slider levels, but some site functionality may also be lost.
}}

In the stock Tor Browser configuration, JavaScript is enabled by default for greater usability. The Tor Project FAQ provides a rationale for this decision: <ref>
https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/faq#TBBJavaScriptEnabled
</ref>

<blockquote>We configure NoScript to allow JavaScript by default in Tor Browser because many websites will not work with JavaScript disabled. Most users would give up on Tor entirely if a website they want to use requires JavaScript, because they would not know how to allow a website to use JavaScript (or that enabling JavaScript might make a website work).<br /> 
There's a trade-off here. On the one hand, we should leave JavaScript enabled by default so websites work the way users expect. On the other hand, we should disable JavaScript by default to better protect against browser vulnerabilities ([https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-security-advisory-old-tor-browser-bundles-vulnerable not just a theoretical concern!]). But there's a third issue: websites can easily determine whether you have allowed JavaScript for them, and if you disable JavaScript by default but then allow a few websites to run scripts (the way most people use NoScript), then your choice of whitelisted websites acts as a sort of cookie that makes you recognizable (and distinguishable), thus harming your anonymity.</blockquote>

The take-home message is disabling all JavaScript with white-list based, pre-emptive script-blocking may better protect against vulnerabilities (many attacks are based on scripting), <ref>
Javascript has previously been used in Windows to [https://www.pcworld.com/article/2046013/tor-project-stop-using-windows-disable-javascript.html deanonymize Tor Browser users with a zero-day exploit] which revealed the computer's MAC address to the attackers.
</ref> but it reduces usability on many sites and acts as a fingerprinting mechanism based on the select sites where it is enabled. <ref name=no_script /> On the other hand, allowing JavaScript by default increases usability and the risk of exploitation, but the specific fingerprint has more in common with the larger user pool. <ref>
Having a large user base is important for strong anonymity, as Roger Dingledine explains [https://www.mail-archive.com/liberationtech@lists.stanford.edu/msg00022.html here].
</ref> <ref>
Another related discussion justifying JavaScript's enabling by default was held on tor-talk; see [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-May/024227.html Tor Browser disabling Javascript anonymity set reduction].
</ref> <ref>
The Tor Project bug report: [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3007 NoScript configured to globally allow all scripts]
</ref>

Developers are unaware of any JavaScript vulnerabilities that could compromise {{project_name}} anonymity. That said, it is inadvisable to change NoScript settings in Tor Browser unless the potential impacts are known. To enable/disable JavaScript, Java and/or plugin execution, left-click the NoScript status bar icon or use the the [https://www.techopedia.com/definition/2828/contextual-menu contextual menu]. <ref>
https://noscript.net/
</ref> Permissions can be granted either temporarily or on a permanent basis using a whitelist. "Temporarily Trusted" will only enable a script(s) for that site until the browser session is closed, or until the permission is manually revoked.

For further information, refer to the [https://noscript.net/ NoScript website] and [https://noscript.net/features features overview], or the [https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/torbutton/en/design/ Torbutton design document].

=== You should Disable JavaScript by Default! ===
{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = <u>Update</u>: 
* {{project name}} now ships with a desktop file and menu options which affect the [[#Security Slider|security slider]] setting after first launching Tor Browser. This provides a choice between maximum security (high setting) versus maximum usability (low setting); see [https://forums.whonix.org/t/ship-an-additional-version-of-tor-browser-with-security-slider-settings-to-high-by-default/7591 this forum thread] for further details. 
* Occasionally users report that setting the slider to "Safest" mode still allows JavaScript to operate in "Standard" mode; refer to this [https://forums.whonix.org/t/broken-security-slider/8675 forum thread] for a fix if you are affected. <ref>To fix this problem, close Tor Browser then run: {{CodeSelect|code=
rm ~/.tb/tor-browser/Browser/TorBrowser/Data/Browser/profile.default/user.js
}} Restart Tor Browser.</ref>
}}

As noted in the previous section, disabling JavaScript by default may worsen fingerprinting. There are several other reasons why {{project_name}} has not made any modifications: 

* {{project name}} is not a "secure browser" project - the focus is on creating a stable, reliable anonymity distribution which aligns with best practice security and privacy principles, informed by educated researchers in the field.
* Possible fingerprinting or security issues with default settings in Tor Browser are the domain of core Tor developers.
* {{project name}} has limited manpower, meaning the resources do not exist to create a more secure browser, even if it was desirable. <ref>Even if the manpower existed, it would make more sense to establish a new "Privacy Browser" project, rather than merge its development with {{project_name}}. At a later stage, the theoretically more secure browser could then be bundled with the {{project name}} platform.</ref>
* Tor Browser is not significantly modified for the same reasons {{project name}} does not [[Tor#Does_Whonix_.E2.84.A2_Modify_Tor.3F|modify]] or attempt to [[Tor#Can_Whonix_.E2.84.A2_Improve_Tor.3F|improve]] Tor. <ref>{{project_name}} includes Tor Browser by default, with only [[Tor_Browser#{{project_name}}_Tor_Browser_Differences|minor]] differences.</ref>
* Having {{project name}} share the [[Fingerprint|fingerprint]] of other Tor Browser users is good for anonymity.

Experienced Tor developer Mike Perry has provided justification for enabling JavaScript by default in a tor-talk mailing list topic; see [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-May/024227.html "Tor Browser disabling Javascript anonymity set reduction"]. In summary, Tor Button and Tor Browser patches handle the most serious JavaScript concerns, such as IP address / location bypass problems. <ref>Although there are unresolved [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?keywords=~tbb-fingerprinting tbb-fingerprinting] and [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?keywords=~tbb-linkability tbb-linkability] issues.</ref>

Due to the loss in functionality, disabling JavaScript by default might place {{project name}} users in a small subset of the Tor Browser population. The JavaScript behavior of the broader population is an open research question, so it safest to avoid changes which might ''reduce'' the anonymity set. Keep in mind the fingerprinting potential is also dependent on Tor Browser's [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9387 security] [[Tor_Browser#Security_Slider|slider]] settings. Ultimately individuals are free to turn JavaScript on or off, depending on their [https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/faq#TBBJavaScriptEnabled security, anonymity and usability preferences].

=== NoScript Custom Setting Persistence ===

It is possible to save custom NoScript settings between browser restarts with a preference. <ref>This preference was first offered in alpha Tor Browser v8.5a2, but is now available in both the alpha and stable Tor Browser series.</ref> This preference is disabled by default, which means custom NoScript settings will not persist across successive Tor Browser sessions. 

==== Warning ====

This preference sacrifices privacy for convenience and is therefore <u>not</u> recommended. While frequently visited sites do not require the constant enabling/disabling of scripts across separate Tor Browser sessions, a number of anonymity risks are introduced: <ref>https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/27175</ref>

* <u>Disk hygiene:</u> Tor Browser is designed to prevent the persistent storage of history records and other on-disk information. This preference violates that design principle by allowing the storage of NoScript per-site permissions, thereby increasing the chance an adversary can extract valuable information from that data.
* <u>Long-term fingerprinting vectors:</u> Persistent per-site settings allow a website to profile Tor Browser users, particularly if [https://www.maketecheasier.com/first-party-isolation-firefox/ first-party isolation] is not enforced. For example, consider the negative anonymity impact of whitelisting Google or Facebook, since their advertisements and tracking widgets are ubiquitous.
* <u>Expert opinion:</u> Experienced Tor developers have confirmed that enabling this preference is dangerous and caution should be exercised. <ref name=caution>https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/27175#comment:12</ref>

==== Persistent NoScript Settings ====

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = <u>Note:</u>
# By defining custom settings in NoScript, this will override the current Tor Browser Security Slider setting. 
# When <code>extensions.torbutton.noscript_persist</code> is set to <code>true</code>, these changes will persist across Tor Browser restarts.
}}

If this is acceptable, in the Tor Browser address bar: 
* <code><i>"Type"</i> about:config</code> &rarr; <code><i>"Press"</i> enter</code> &rarr; <code><i>"Choose"</i> I accept the risk!</code> &rarr; <code><i>"Type"</i> extensions.torbutton.noscript_persist</code> &rarr; <code><i>"Toggle"</i> to true</code> <ref>https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-85a2</ref>

This preference will be overridden and all custom per-site settings lost, if:

* The security slider setting is changed afterwards; or <ref name=caution />  
* <code>extensions.torbutton.noscript_persist</code> is again set to <code>false</code>, <ref>The default Tor Browser setting.</ref> since NoScript settings are reset after Tor Browser syncs with the Security Slider position.

== Non-default Add-ons ==
As Tor Browser is based on Firefox, any browser add-on that is compatible with Firefox can also be installed in Tor Browser. In this context, add-ons are the collective name given to extensions, themes and plugins: <ref name=plugins>https://tb-manual.torproject.org/plugins/</ref> 

* Extensions add new features to Firefox or modify existing ones, like video downloaders, ad blockers and so on.
* Themes change the appearance of the browser, such as buttons, menus and the background image. 
* Plugins add support for Internet content and often include patented formats like Flash and Silverlight which are used for video, audio, online games and more. <ref>https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/find-and-install-add-ons-add-features-to-firefox</ref>

=== Non-default Add-on Risks ===
The Tor Project explicitly warns against using non-default add-ons with Tor Browser: <ref name=plugins />

<blockquote>However, the only add-ons that have been tested for use with Tor Browser are those included by default. Installing any other browser add-ons may break functionality in Tor Browser or cause more serious problems that affect your privacy and security. It is strongly discouraged to install additional add-ons, and the Tor Project will not offer support for these configurations.

...

Video websites, such as Vimeo make use of the Flash Player plugin to display video content. Unfortunately, this software operates independently of Tor Browser and cannot easily be made to obey Tor Browser’s proxy settings. It can therefore reveal your real location and IP address to the website operators, or to an outside observer. For this reason, Flash is disabled by default in Tor Browser, and enabling it is not recommended.</blockquote>

=== Recommendations ===

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text    = '''Warning:''' For the safest Tor Browser experience, it is recommended to avoid Java, JavaScript, Flash, themes, browser plugins and other non-default add-ons. 
}}

The problem with non-default add-ons is that they are often comprised of [[non-free]] software, which can lead to the linkage of activities conducted under one pseudonym. They also worsen fingerprinting and open up attack vectors in the form of remote exploits.

This advice holds true even though {{project_name}} is configured to prevent these applications (along with malware) from leaking the real external IP address, even if they are misconfigured (see [[Features]]). Before installing non-default add-ons, first consider the various alternatives such as HTML5 or online media converters. <ref>For example, most [https://www.youtube.com/html5|Youtube videos] can be viewed in HTML5 which Tor Browser supports and prefers.</ref>

| text    = As noted in the [[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#Torbutton_Design|Tor Button Design]] entry, the [https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-90 release of Tor Browser 9.0] resulted in both the Torbutton and Tor Launcher extensions being tightly integrated into Tor Browser: <blockquote>... Torbutton has been moved from the URL bar and neither appears on the <code>about:addons</code> page. Other changes include the New Identity function shifting to the URL bar and the New Tor Circuit function being accessible via the hamburger menu. ... No functionality has been lost -- Torbutton's functions in Tor Browser behavior have [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/10760 simply moved into direct Firefox patches].</blockquote>
}}

Tor alone is not enough to protect anonymity and privacy while browsing the Internet. All modern web browsers support [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript JavaScript], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash Adobe Flash], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie cookies] and other features which are capable of defeating the anonymity <ref>[[DoNot#Confuse_Anonymity_with_Pseudonymity]]</ref> provided by the Tor network.

In Tor Browser, these features are handled from inside the browser, because it is a [https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor-browser.git modified (patched) version of Firefox] and it contains direct patches (based on the former [https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/torbutton/ Torbutton extension]) that take care of application-level security and privacy concerns in Firefox. This means many types of active content are disabled. <ref>https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/torbutton/torbutton-faq.html.en</ref>

It is recommended to learn more about [[Fingerprint|Fingerprinting]] and [[Data Collection Techniques]] to better understand the potential threats. Advanced users can also review detailed information about the former Torbutton design and its various functions [[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#Torbutton_Design|here]].

== New Identity Function ==

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text    = '''Warning:''' The New Identity feature will ''likely'' create a new Tor exit relay and a new IP address, but this is not guaranteed.
}}

The "New Identity" menu option sends the protocol command "signal newnym" to Tor's ControlPort. This clears the browser state, closes tabs, and obtains a fresh Tor circuit for future requests. <ref>https://blog.torproject.org/blog/torbutton-141-released</ref> 

Sometimes Tor only replaces the middle relay while using the same Tor exit relay; this is by design and the Tor default. Further, "signal newnym" does not interfere with long-lived connections such as an IRC connection.

New Identity is not yet perfect and there are open bugs; this is not a {{project_name}}-specific issue. {{Browser_Fingerprinting_Footnote}}
For greater security, it is better to completely close Tor Browser and restart it. In [[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]], the safest option when performing sensitive activities is using a {{workstation_product_name}} [[Qubes/DisposableVM|Disposable]]. To completely separate distinct activities, shut down the Disposable and create a new one between sessions.

There are two ways to use the New Identity feature:

# <code>Left-click the Hamburger Icon</code> &rarr; <code>Select "New Identity"</code> <br />
# <code>Left-click the 'broom' icon in the URL bar</code>

Please read [[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#New_Tor_Circuit_Design|New Tor Circuit Design]] and the [[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#New_Identity_Design|New Identity Design]] to learn more about this option and its limitations.

== New Tor Circuit Function ==

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text    = '''Warning:''' This function does not attempt to clear Tor browsing session data or unlink activity, unlike the "New Identity" feature. 
}}

The "New Tor Circuit for this Site" feature creates a new circuit for the <i>current</i> Tor Browser tab, including other open tabs or windows from the same website. <ref>https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9442</ref> If it is really necessary to separate contextual identities, it is always safer to close and then restart Tor Browser.

There are several, potential use cases for this feature: <ref>https://tails.boum.org/doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser/index.en.html</ref>

* The Tor exit relay is located in a country which negatively affects the presentation of the website due to language localization.
* The site is censored due to the current Tor exit relay in use (caused by Tor IP address blacklisting).
* To bypass Google [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA CAPTCHA] or [https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/v3.html reCAPTHA] systems protecting sites from abuse if these are showing unsolvable captcha or no captcha at all.
* Connections to websites become unresponsive or slow.
* To change the Tor exit relay IP address without losing all open tabs.

To use it: <code>Left-click the Hamburger Icon</code> &rarr; <code>Select "New Tor Circuit for this Site"</code>

Advanced users who want to learn more about this function should refer to the [[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#New_Tor_Circuit_Design|New Tor Circuit Design]] entry.

== Check for Tor Browser Update ==

Notifications will automatically appear if a Tor Browser update is available; see [[#Tor_Browser_Internal_Updater|Tor Browser Internal Updater]] for further information and screenshots of this process. Note that [[#Update_Tor_Browser|multiple methods]] exist for updating Tor Browser.

To manually check for Tor Browser updates: <code>Enter about:preferences in the URL bar</code> &rarr; <code>Scroll down to "Tor Browser Updates"</code> &rarr; <code>Click "<u>C</u>heck for updates"</code>

== Disabled Functions ==

== Security Slider ==

Tor Browser includes a “Security Slider” that allows the disabling of certain web features that can be used to compromise security and anonymity. At present there are three levels: "Safest", "Safer" and "Standard". It is necessary to make a trade-off between security, usability and privacy. At the higher levels the slider will prevent some sites from working properly. <ref>https://tb-manual.torproject.org/en-US/security-slider.html</ref> Note that as of Tor Browser release v8.5, the security slider function has shifted to the taskbar. <ref>https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-85</ref> <ref>https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/29825</ref> 

To use this feature: <code>Click Security Level button (taskbar 'shield')</code> &rarr; <code>Click "Advanced Security Settings..."</code> &rarr; <code>Select desired security level</code>

==== Preventing SSLStrip Attacks ====

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = If clicking or pasting a download link, make sure it is <code>http'''s'''://</code>. The <code>s</code> in <code>http'''s'''://</code> stands for "secure".
}}

A common misconception is that a secure, green padlock and a <code>http'''s'''://</code> URL makes any download from that particular website secure. This is not the case because the website might be redirecting to <code>http</code>. In fact, an [https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/41988/how-does-sslstrip-work SSLstrip attack] might succeed if a link is pasted or typed into the address bar without the <code>https://</code> component (e.g. <code>torproject.org</code> instead of <code>https://torproject.org</code>) -- the reason is a padlock is not visible; it just appears empty. <ref>And that website does not:

* Use [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)]. See also: https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/91092/how-does-bypassing-hsts-with-sslstrip-work-exactly. Without HSTS, sites with non-encrypted resources or sub-domains are vulnerable to SSLstrip.
* Have a [https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere HTTPS Everywhere] rule in effect.
* Use [https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2012/11/01/preloading-hsts/ HSTS preloading].
* Use [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Public_Key_Pinning HTTP Public Key Pinning]. See also: https://news.netcraft.com/archives/2016/03/22/secure-websites-shun-http-public-key-pinning.html. HPKP limits trust to a handful of Certificate Authorities, but is not used by many websites due to the risk of site breakage if keys are not managed vigilantly.
</ref>

To avoid this risk and similar threats, <u>always explicitly type or paste <code>https://</code> in the URL / address bar</u>. The SSL certificate button or padlock will not appear, but that is nothing to be concerned about. Unfortunately, few people follow this sage advice; instead most mistakenly believe pasting or typing www.torproject.org into the address bar is safe.

==== Other Precautions ====

For improved safety when downloading files or installing software, follow the advice below.

=== Navigating Tor Browser Downloads ===
{{Tor_Browser_Downloads}}

== Prioritize Onion Connections ==

The release of Tor Browser v9.5 provides a new Onion Location function: <ref>https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-95</ref>

<blockquote>Website publishers now can advertise their onion service to Tor users by adding an HTTP header. When visiting a website that has both an .onion address and Onion Location enabled via Tor Browser, users will be prompted about the onion service version of the site and will be asked to opt-in to upgrade to the onion service on their first use.</blockquote>

This feature has been implemented across the entire <code>whonix.org</code> ecosystem, including the homepage, wiki, forums, phabricator and repository. <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/onion-forum-site-redirects-to-clearnet/197</ref>

'''Figure:''' ''Onion Location Indicator for {{project_name}} Forums''

[[Image:Whonixonionnotification.png|border]]

Once the "Always Prioritize Onions" option is set in Tor Browser, the relevant onion resource will always be preferred in the future. If you want to only upgrade to the onion resource one time, click "Not Now" and then press the "Onion Available" button one more time. This browser feature is located in <code>about:preferences#privacy</code> and can be changed at any time. <ref>
The Tor Project server side Onion Location feature is documented [https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor-browser-spec.git/tree/proposals/100-onion-location-header.txt here].
</ref>

'''Figure:''' ''Prioritize the Onion Site''

[[Image:Prioritizeonions.png|border]]

'''Figure:''' ''Prioritized {{project_name}} Onion Forums''

Security impact: none. <ref>Onion location header is a server side feature. Not a client side feature.

Quote [https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor-browser-spec.git/tree/proposals/100-onion-location-header.txt Onion redirects using Onion-Location HTTP header]:

<blockquote>3. Drawbacks

3.1. No security/performance benefits

   While we could come up with onion redirection proposals that provide
   security and performance benefits, this proposal does not actually provide
   any of those.

   As a matter of fact, the security remains the same as connecting to normal
   websites, since for this proposal to work we need to trust their HTTP headers,
   and the user might have already provided identifying information
   (e.g. cookies) to the website. The performance is worse than connecting to a
   normal website, since Tor first needs to connect to the website, get its
   headers, and then finally connect to the onion.

   Still _all_ the website approaches mentioned in the "Motivation" section
   suffer from the above drawbacks, and sysadmins still come up with ad-hoc
   ways to inform users about their onions. So this simple proposal will still
   help those websites and also pave the way forward for future auto-redirect 
techniques.</blockquote></ref>

For security improvement it might help to force connections to onions for websites that are reachable over clearnet and onion. This is currently only documented for [[Forcing .onion on Project]] but [[undocumented]] for arbitrary websites. Doing so would be possible as per [[Free Support Principle]].

== Browser Language ==
In 2021, the stable and experimental Tor Browser binaries with additional language packs support 34 languages. Recent additions include: Catalan, Irish, Indonesian, Icelandic, Norwegian, Danish, Hebrew, Swedish, Traditional Chinese, Macedonian and Romanian. <ref>https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-80</ref> <ref>https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-90</ref> <ref>https://www.torproject.org/download/languages/</ref> For instructions on changing the Tor Browser interface to a language other than English, see [[Language#Tor_Browser|Tor Browser Language]]. <ref>Language packs might be another fingerprinting vector, but this issue requires further investigation.</ref>

== Local Connections ==

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = Web HTTP(S)/SOCKS proxies have different instructions and will not work with these steps, see [[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#Change_Proxy_Settings|Tor Browser Proxy Configuration]]. 
}}

Sometimes it is necessary to access the local application interface on <code>127.0.0.1</code> in order to run specific applications like I2P. <ref>Since it uses predetermined ports on the localhost.</ref> Due to potential fingerprinting and information leakage risks, this behavior is no longer possible in Tor Browser unless an exception is configured. <ref>https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/10419</ref> <ref>https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/11493</ref>

To configure an exception for local connections in Tor Browser: <ref>Alternatively it is possible to  [[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#Remove_Proxy_Settings|remove Tor Browser's proxy settings]], but this method is still vulnerable to the same fingerprinting issues as configuring an exception. There are also other factors which will worsen the user's fingerprint, such as the breaking of both stream isolation and the tab isolation by socks user name in Tor Browser.</ref>

<code>Preferences</code> &rarr; <code>General Tab</code> &rarr; <code>Network Proxy | Settings...</code> &rarr; <code>No Proxy for: "127.0.0.1"</code> &rarr; <code>click "OK"</code>

The configured exception means a small trade-off in privacy, but it is much safer than using another browser (see [[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#Local_Connections_Exception_Threat_Analysis|Local Connections Exception Threat Analysis]]).

=== Recommendations ===

For better anonymity:

* Browse with JavaScript disabled in Tor Browser and enable it only when needed. Disabled JavaScript mitigates these browser fingerprinting issues completely.
* Set passwords for web interfaces listening on the localhost.
* Run sensitive daemons with local WebGUIs on a separate, dedicated {{workstation_product_name}} and virtual network instance. TODO: expand or link how to do that

== Bypass Tor Censorship ==

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = This section outlines how to bypass Tor blocks by destination websites. If connections to the Tor network are blocked at the ISP level, then [[Bridges|bridges]] or other circumvention tools are necessary.
}}

A number of websites or services [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/doc/ListOfServicesBlockingTor actively block Tor users] via:

* A DNS query-based list used to tag IP addresses.
* Blocking software like [http://akamai.com/ Akamai] and [https://www.cloudflare.com/ Cloudflare].
* Other individual blocks.

There are various ad-hoc methods available to try and circumvent blocks. In most cases it is unnecessary to [[Tunnels/Introduction|create a tunnel]] which pairs {{project_name}} with other protocols (such as a VPN) in order to access the content.

The following services fetch content via other websites, which is a privacy trade-off. Further, only some services are effective with embedded, non-static content or support specific file types like PDF, .exe and mp3. <ref>https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/doc/ListOfServicesBlockingTor#Ad-hocSolutionsforaccessingblockedcontentonTor</ref>

== Harden Tor Browser ==

Anonymity and safety can be materially improved via: AppArmor, Firejail confinement, Tor Browser settings, sandboxing, multiple Tor Browser instances, and operation of {{workstation_product_name}} Disposables ([[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]]) or multiple {{workstation_product_name}}.

Tor Browser provides reasonable security in its stock configuration. However, mitigating the risk of Tor Browser security breaches makes sense, because it is an untrusted application with a huge attack surface; it is frequently  attacked successfully in the wild by adversaries.

{{Anchor|Hardening}}
! scope="row"| Firejail Confinement
| Firejail can be used as an alternative sandboxing measure to restrict the Tor Browser process. The Tor Browser Starter by {{project_name}} developers in {{project_name}} testers repository includes a “hardening” option that permits certain features to be enabled that on the upside increase security, but on the downside might decrease anonymity. <ref>[https://github.com/Whonix/tb-starter/blob/master/usr/bin/torbrowser tb-starter] will enable the Tor Browser Firejail profile. [https://forums.whonix.org/t/automatically-firejailing-tor-browser/4767/21 development discussion]
</ref>

It is necessary to make a trade-off between security, usability and privacy. With “hardening” enabled, certain website features might be non-functional or Tor Browser may no longer start after an upgrade. Also, the [[Fingerprint#Visited_Websites|fingerprint]] seen by websites ('web fingerprint') might reveal subtle differences between Tor Browser instances that have enabled this feature compared to the default configuration. The population of Linux Tor Browser users who regularly utilize Firejail is likely to be tiny. At the time of writing (2019) there were no reports confirming a detectable fingerprint, but there is also no known research being undertaken in this area. <ref>The Tor Project does not currently provide a hardened / sandboxed Tor Browser build, see: [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/25540 Stop building and distributing sandboxed-tor-browser binaries].</ref> <ref>[https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/TorBrowser/Sandbox/Linux Linux Sandboxed Tor Browser Documentation]: <blockquote>WARNING: This project is no longer maintained.

= Update Tor Browser =
== Introduction ==

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = It is recommended to follow [https://blog.torproject.org The Tor Project blog] to stay informed about recent updates.
}}

Unfortunately, updating Tor Browser is more complex than regular system updates due to technical limitations outside of {{project name}} control. <ref>
[[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#Tor_Browser_Update:_Technical_Details|Tor Browser Update:Technical Details]]
</ref> However, the following instructions will keep Tor Browser up-to-date at all times.

There are three options for updating Tor Browser in {{project_name}}:

# The <code>{{project_name}}</code> [[#Tor_Browser_Downloader_by_{{project_name}}|Tor Browser Downloader]]. <ref>This does [https://phabricator.whonix.org/T400 not yet notice upgrades] performed by Tor Browser's Internal Updater.</ref>
# <code>The Tor Project</code>'s Tor Browser [[#Tor_Browser_Internal_Updater|Internal Updater]]. <ref>Since v5.0, Tor Browser is configured to [https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-50-released update itself].</ref>
# Tor Browser [[#Tor_Browser_Manual_Update|manual updates]].

The first two methods are suitable in most circumstances. Manual updates are only required if the {{project_name}} Tor Browser update script ever breaks. Never continue to use an outdated version of Tor Browser, otherwise serious security flaws may degrade anonymity or result in a VM compromise. <ref>https://tb-manual.torproject.org/en-US/updating.html</ref>

{{Anchor|Tor Browser Updater ({{project_name_short}})}}

== Tor Browser Downloader by {{project_name}} ==
=== Configuration ===
==== Manual Download Version Choice ====
If the online detected version (for example <code>INFO: Online detected version: 10.5</code>) is different from the version number intended for download, it is possible to manually choose the download version on the command line. This can be useful when a new version of Tor Browser has been released but the version file <ref>
At time of writing: https://aus1.torproject.org/torbrowser/update_3/release/downloads.json
</ref> has not been updated yet by The Tor Project. The version file which is used to programmatically detect the latest Tor Browser version is usually updated a few days after new releases. <ref>
This might be due to pragmatic reasons (work flow) or perhaps this is a staged rollout release strategy. (The term staged rollout hasn't been seen; see this definition [https://medium.com/bleeding-edge/the-art-of-staging-a-rollout-8e203b337b75 here].)

</ref>

Syntax:

{{CodeSelect|code=
tbb_version=version.number update-torbrowser
}}

Example:

Note: Replace <code>10.5</code> with the actual version number.

{{CodeSelect|code=
tbb_version=10.5 update-torbrowser
}}

==== Onion Download ====
It is possible to download over onion rather than clearnet.

To permanently set downloads over onion, apply the following instructions.

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Open <code>/etc/torbrowser.d/50_user.conf</code> in an editor with root rights.

{{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/torbrowser.d/50_user.conf
}}

'''2.''' Add the following setting.

{{CodeSelect|code=
tb_onion=true
}}

'''3.''' Save the file.

The procedure is complete.
}}

Alternatively, the following command could be used to download over onion only once.

{{CodeSelect|code=
update-torbrowser --onion
}}

{{Anchor|alpha}}
{{Anchor|Alpha}}

==== Alpha Version ====
{{Testers-only}}

It is possible to configure the downloading of alpha rather than stable Tor Browser versions. Becoming a tester is a helpful way to [[contribute]] to {{project name}}.

To permanently enable downloading alpha versions, apply the following instructions.

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Open <code>/etc/torbrowser.d/50_user.conf</code> in an editor with root rights.

{{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/torbrowser.d/50_user.conf
}}

'''2.''' Add the following setting.

{{CodeSelect|code=
tbb_download_alpha_version=true
}}

'''3.''' Save the file.

The procedure is complete.
}}

Alternatively, the following command could be used to download the alpha version only once.

{{CodeSelect|code=
update-torbrowser --alpha
}}

=== Installation Process ===
'''Note:''' {{Code2|Tor Browser Downloader ({{project_name}})}} is really just a downloader, not an updater. This means it is incapable of retaining user data such as bookmarks and passwords. In order to preserve data, use the [[#Tor_Browser_Internal_Updater|Internal Updater]] method instead.

To use {{Code2|Tor Browser Downloader ({{project_name}})}}, follow these instructions in {{workstation_product_name}}.

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Perform [[Update|standard ("everyday") upgrades]]. <ref>
Issues such as outdated signing keys, updated file locations might have been fixed in the upgraded version.

Tor Browser Downloader can download Tor Browser. Tor Browser Downloader cannot upgrade itself. It's upgraded together with standard ("everyday") upgrades.
</ref>

'''2.''' Launch Tor Browser Downloader.

{{Box|text=
<u>If you are using [[Qubes|{{q_project_name}}]]</u>, to ensure that <u>new</u> App Qubes and [[Qubes/DisposableVM|Disposables]] are created with a copy of the latest Tor Browser version, complete the following steps:

<code>Qubes App Launcher (blue/grey "Q")</code> &rarr; <code>{{workstation_product_name}} Template</code> (<code>{{whonix-ws}}</code>) &rarr; <code>Tor Browser Downloader ({{project_name}})</code>

<u>If you are using [[Qubes|{{q_project_name}}]]</u>, to re-install the latest Tor Browser version in <u>existing</u> {{workstation_product_name}} App Qubes, complete the following steps:

<code>Qubes App Launcher (blue/grey "Q")</code> &rarr; <code>{{workstation_product_name}} App Qube</code> (<code>anon-whonix</code>) &rarr; <code>Tor Browser Downloader ({{project_name}})</code>

<u>If you are using a graphical {{workstation_product_name}}</u>, complete the following steps:

<code>Start Menu</code> &rarr; <code>Applications</code> &rarr; <code>System</code> &rarr; <code>Tor Browser Downloader ({{project_name}})</code>

<u>If you are using a terminal</u>, complete the following steps:
{{CodeSelect|code=
update-torbrowser
}}
}}

The downloader will show it is checking for updates.

'''Figure:''' ''Checking for Updates''

[[File:Tor Browser Downloader({{project_name_short}}) checking for updates.png|400px|Tor Browser Downloader ({{project_name}}) checking for updates.]]

'''3.''' Selected the preferred Tor Browser version when prompted. 

Select the Tor Browser version and confirm installation. Take heed of the warning in the confirmation box stating <u>the existing Tor Browser user profile (including bookmarks and passwords) will be lost during this process.</u>

'''Figure:''' ''Download Confirmation''

[[File:torbrowserdownloader.png|Tor Browser Downloader ({{project_name}}) Download Confirmation]]

After agreeing to the download process, a progress indicator will be displayed by the downloader. This process can be lengthy depending on the speed of the Tor network connection.

'''Figure:''' ''Downloading Tor Browser''

[[File:Tor Browser Downloader({{project_name_short}}) downloading.png|400px|Tor Browser Downloader ({{project_name}}) Downloading Tor Browser.]]

'''4.''' Check the Tor Browser signature was correctly verified.

Once the download has finished, the downloader will provide verification (or not) of the cryptographic signature associated with the Tor Browser binary, highlighting the key used to sign it and the date. The downloader will then ask for confirmation to install the package: see [[#Installation_Confirmation_Notification|Installation Confirmation Notification]] for steps on identifying a possible targeted attack.

'''Figure:''' ''Tor Browser Installation Confirmation''

[[File:torbrowserdownloader2.png|Tor Browser Downloader ({{project_name}}) Installation Confirmation.]]

'''5.''' Confirm installation of Tor Browser.

If the installation process is confirmed, the downloader will extract Tor Browser.

[[File:Tor Browser Downloader({{project_name_short}}) Extracting.png|400px|Tor Browser Downloader ({{project_name}}) Extracting.]]

'''6.''' ''Optional:'' Launch Tor Browser.

In the final step, the downloader will prompt whether the upgraded Tor Browser should be launched, unless the procedure was completed in a Qubes {{workstation_product_name}} Template (<code>{{whonix-ws}}</code>).

}}

=== Download Confirmation Notification ===

This step is designed to keep {{project_name}} users safe, since at present there is no reliable and secure way for a program to determine the latest stable version of Tor Browser with reasonable certainty. <ref>[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/14383 Finalize RecommendedTBBVersions format]</ref> <ref>[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/13065 Counter downgrade / stale mirror attacks on RecommendedTBBVersions - sign / verify tbb versions file]</ref> When the version format changes, the automated parser of version information could falsely suggest: 

* An earlier stable version that is still considered secure. 
* An alpha series release.
* A beta Tor Browser build.
* A release candidate or nightly Tor Browser build.

Alternatively, one might be targeted by a denial of service, indefinite freeze or rollback (downgrade) attack. <ref>For a definition of these attacks, see the [https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/develop/SECURITY.md threat model] of [https://theupdateframework.github.io/ TUF] ([https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf The Update Framework]) ([http://www.webcitation.org/6F7Io2ncN w]).</ref>
<ref>Adversaries capable of breaking [[SSL]] could mount these attacks by replacing [https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/RecommendedTBBVersions RecommendedTBBVersions] with invalid, frozen or outdated version information.</ref>

To counter these threats, user intelligence is utilized as a sanity check. The Download Confirmation Notification provides a way to detect such situations and abort the procedure. In this instance, it is recommended to rotate the Tor circuits and attempt the download process again.

Version numbers that are visible under {{Code2|Online versions}} come from an online resource. The Tor Browser [https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/RecommendedTBBVersions RecommendedTBBVersions] versions file is provided by The Tor Project, and is parsed by {{project name}} Tor Browser Downloader. The {{project_name}} downloader will indicate that no upgrade is required if the installed Tor Browser version matches the up-to-date online version.

TODO: expand.

=== Installation Confirmation Notification ===

This step is also designed to protect users, since at present there is no reliable and secure way for a program to determine (with reasonable certainty) if the Tor Browser download was targeted by an indefinite freeze or rollback attack. <ref>Unfortunately, Tor Browser signatures do not yet provide expiration dates in a manner similar to Debian's [https://blog.ganneff.de/2008/09/valid-until-field-in-release-f.html valid-until] field.</ref> <ref>Rollback attacks are possible because if a computer's clock is wrong, there is no solid basis for comparison.</ref>

When verifying cryptographic signatures, several important aspects must be considered:

* The signature should be made by a trusted key.
* Trusted keys will have signed other files in the past. It is also necessary to check if the right file was received, and not just any file that was signed by a trusted key.
* Even if the correct file type is received, <ref>That is, a browser and not a messenger or other application.</ref> it is necessary to check it has a <i>current</i> signature attached and not a historical one. This step counters the threat of indefinite freeze and rollback attacks.

By the time the Installation Confirmation Notification is visible, the verification of the signature (and hash) will have already succeeded. However, the signature creation dates in the figure below must be carefully examined to confirm that an indefinite freeze or downgrade attack did not occur. 

<u>Previous Signature Creation Date</u>: When Tor Browser was previously installed by tb-updater, the creation date of the accompanying signature that signed Tor Browser will have been stored. The {{Code2|Previous Signature Creation Date}} field displays that date.<br />
<u>Last Signature Creation Date</u>: This field displays the date of signature creation for the downloaded file.

== Tor Browser Internal Updater ==
Tor Browser upgrades are possible from within the browser using Tor Browser Internal Updater (by <code>The Tor Project</code>). <ref>
https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-50-released

<blockquote>Starting with this release, Tor Browser will now also download and apply upgrades in the background, to ensure that users upgrade quicker and with less interaction. This behavior is governed by the about:config pref app.update.auto, but we do not recommend disabling it unless you really know what you're doing.</blockquote>
</ref> When a new Tor Browser version is available but the browser has not completed an automatic upgrade in the background (the default), a warning prompt appears recommending a manual upgrade. To upgrade, either:

* <code>Enter about:preferences in the URL bar</code> &rarr; <code>Scroll down to "Tor Browser Updates"</code> &rarr; <code>Click "<u>C</u>heck for updates"</code>; or
* <code>Open Menu</code> &rarr; <code>Help</code> &rarr; <code>About Tor Browser</code> &rarr; <code>Wait until the download finishes</code> &rarr; <code>Restart to update Tor Browser</code>

'''Figure:''' ''Tor Browser Update Notification''

[[File:TBBupdater.png|600px]]

Using Tor Browser Internal Updater automatically makes use of its built-in [[Verifying Software Signatures|software signatures verification]] feature. <ref>
The internal updater process involves several automatic steps ([https://blog.torproject.org/comment/288479#comment-288479 source]):

<blockquote>1) Tor Browser contacts server "A" and asks if an update is available. If there is an update, then server "A" responds with metadata about the update file (a URL for that file, the size of the file, the SHA512 hash of the file). 
2) Tor Browser follows the provided URL and connects to server "B" and downloads the file
3) Tor Browser verifies the size of the file and sha512 hash of the file are as expected 
4) Tor Browser verifies the cryptographic signature on the file. Tor Browser has two public keys hard-coded for which signatures on updates will be accepted.

The update is installed after all checks pass.</blockquote>
</ref> Manual software resignation verification is not required when using this update method.

== Tor Browser Manual Update ==

}}

Modern Tor Browser releases are generally easy to install and update on well-supported platforms like {{project_name}}, leading most to have a comfortable and reliable experience over long periods. However, if/when Tor Browser "breaks", some might find it difficult to perform a manual installation. <ref>Before the introduction of [[Tor_Browser#Tor_Browser_Internal_Updater|Tor Browser's internal updater]], manual installation was a difficult task which required the renaming (or deletion) of the old Tor Browser folder before the new version was extracted. If Tor Browser functions "under the hood" are a mystery, then unsurprisingly problems are often encountered during manual installation, particularly on the host.</ref>

=== {{project_name}} Bugs ===

Sometimes [[Tor_Browser#Tor_Browser_Downloader_by_Whonix_.E2.84.A2|Tor Browser Downloader]] inside {{workstation_product_name}} breaks because torproject.org changes the way Tor Browser can be downloaded or verified. This program is maintained by the [[Contributors|{{project_name}} contributors]] and The Tor Project is not responsible for necessary fixes. Generally, [http://forums.whonix.org/c/news {{project_name}} news] will be published within a few days with working instructions on how to fix the problem. If this does not happen, then {{project_name}} developers are unaware of the issue. 

Any bugs should be discussed in the {{project_name}} [https://forums.whonix.org User Help Forum]. To date, no bugs were ever discovered in Tor Browser that were directly related to {{project_name}} code and which might cause serious problems such as website pages failing to load.

=== Prerequisite Knowledge ===

The [[Manually_Downloading_Tor_Browser|manual Tor Browser download]] procedure assumes essential knowledge of:

* <u>Software Verification</u>: The Tor Browser package must be verified with PGP, using the associated file signature and Tor signing keys (relevant links are provided). <ref>{{project_name}} is not a standalone package, but a complete operating system. {{project_name}} has a small team, while torproject.org has a much larger community and dedicated, paid support staff. Therefore, {{project_name}} users are expected to learn Tor Browser essentials in the first instance.</ref>
* <u>Troubleshooting</u>: If Tor Browser problems occur in {{project_name}} such as webpages failing to resolve, then:
** The same tests should be performed on the host ({{non_q_project_name_short}}) or in a non-{{project_name}} VM ({{q_project_name}}); see [[Install_Tor_Browser_Outside_of_{{project_name_short}}|Non-{{project_name}} Tor Browser]]. This step helps to determine whether the problem is related to {{project_name}} or not. 
** It is also sensible to search for the problem on [https://trac.torproject.org/ torproject.org's bug tracker] and report a bug upstream if it has not been notified yet. In that case, when upstream (TPO) fixes the issue, the issue will most likely also get fixed in {{project_name}}.

= Unsafe Tor Browser Habits =
It is important to develop a set of safe habits when communicating, browsing or downloading with Tor Browser. Even the world's premier anonymity software cannot protect people if they shoot themselves in the foot.

The following is an inexhaustive list of unsafe behaviors. It is recommended to also read the {{project_name}} [[DoNot|Tips on Remaining Anonymous]] entry, along with [https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/documentation.html.en Tor Project documentation] before using Tor Browser for serious activities necessitating anonymity.

<blockquote>I've been looking for how to fix some bad default settings in the {{project_name}} tor browser. Namely, they removed NoScript from the toolbar, so that the NoScript cannot be used as intended.</blockquote>

As noted in the [[Tor Browser#Tor Browser Bundle versus {{project name}} Tor Browser|{{project name}} Tor Browser Differences]] entry, {{project name}} does <u>not</u>: 

* change Tor Browser's internal updater checking mechanism; 
* change or remove proxy settings by default; or 
* modify Tor Browser's startup script, default settings and so on. 

In fact, the NoScript URL bar change was a conscious decision by Tor developers which became part of a recent release: <ref>

<blockquote>If you want to turn off javascript, then you can change the security level. There is also nothing preventing you from adding NoScript on the toolbar even if it is not there by default.</blockquote>

== Tor Browser Bundle versus {{project_name}} Tor Browser ==

The regular Tor Browser Bundle and {{project_name}} Tor Browser slightly differ. The reason is Tor Browser must be adjusted by {{project_name}} to work behind {{gateway_product_name}}. 

The main {{project_name}} Tor Browser differences can be summarized as follows: <ref>
https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/19652
</ref>

* Environmental variable adjustments. <ref>
* [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor/blob/master/usr/libexec/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor/torbrowser.sh <code>/usr/libexec/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor/torbrowser.sh</code>]
</ref> Despite environmental variable adjustments, the network and browser fingerprint remain the same.
* [[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#tor-launcher|tor-launcher]] (Tor connection wizard) will not be shown in {{workstation_product_name}} Tor Browser. Instead, [[Anon Connection Wizard]] is available in {{gateway_product_name}}.
* The Tor Circuit View and Open Network Settings functions have been [[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#Disabled_Tor_Browser_Functions|disabled]]. The former is [[unsupported]] for security reasons, <ref>This is so {{workstation_product_name}} does not have access to the information about which Tor middle relay or Tor entry guard [or bridge] are in use. See also: [[Dev/Control_Port_Filter_Proxy#Indicator_for_current_Circuit_Status_and_Exit_IP|Indicator for current Circuit Status and Exit IP]].</ref> while the latter would have no effect since Tor must be configured in {{gateway_product_name}}.
* The default landing page after Tor Browser starts is set to a local {{project_name}} resource. <ref>The default Tor Browser Bundle uses <i>about:tor</i> as the landing page. See: https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/13835</ref>
* [[DoNot#Allow_Tor_over_Tor_Scenarios|Tor over Tor scenarios]] are prevented in {{workstation_product_name}}. <ref>
[[Dev/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor]]
</ref>
* Extracted to folder <code>~/.tb/tor-browser</code>.

{{project_name}} <u>does not</u>:

* Change Tor Browser's [[#Tor_Browser_Internal_Updater|Internal Updater checking mechanism]].
* Modify Tor Browser's startup script, default settings and so on. <ref>In {{workstation_product_name}}, [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor] listens on {{Code2|127.0.0.1}} {{Code2|9150}} and {{Code2|9151}} (Tor Browser's default ports) and forwards them to {{gateway_product_name}} {{Code2|10.152.152.10 9150}} (where a Tor SocksPort is listening) and {{Code2|9151}} (where [[Dev/CPFP|Control Port Filter Proxy]] is listening).

== Tor Browser Functionality on Different Platforms ==
{{mbox

| text    = It is not [http://forums.whonix.org/t/just-curious-why-no-warning-to-not-maximize-your-window-whilst-using-whonix-browsers/3932/9 valid to make a comparison] between the Windows version of TBB and the {{project_name}} Tor Browser concerning functionality, for instance why the warning message does not appear in {{project_name}} when maximizing the browser window. <ref>No changes have been made in {{project_name}} code to prevent such a warning.</ref>
}}

The reason is this comparison includes a host of platform-specific differences which confound the result. For example, a more valid comparison would examine the differences between:

* TBB in Debian (real Debian, not in Qubes) versus Tor Browser in [[{{non q project name short}}|{{non q project name}}]].
* TBB in a Qubes App Qube based on a Debian Template versus Tor Browser in [[Qubes|{{q_project_name}}]].

Similarly, these comparisons would be helpful in order to help with TBB (non-{{project_name}}) development:

* TBB in Debian (real Debian, not in Qubes) vs TBB in Windows.
* TBB in different Linux distributions.
* TBB in different Windows platforms.

ERROR: Tor Browser ended with non-zero (error) exit code!

Tor Browser was started with:

/home/user/.tb/tor-browser/Browser/start-tor-browser --allow-remote /usr/share/homepage/whonix-welcome-page/whonix.html

Tor Browser exited with code: 1 

To see this for yourself, you could try: 
Start Menu -> System -> Xfce Terminal 
Then run: 
torbrowser
</pre>

Even though this is happening inside {{Project name}}, the cause is most often unrelated to {{Project name}} code. Tor Browser is developed by [https://www.torproject.org The Tor Project], which is an independent entity. The is the norm in Linux distributions. To learn more about such relationships see [[Linux User Experience versus Commercial Operating Systems]].

{{Project name}} does integration work to get Tor Browser into the platform. To use a simple analogy, {{Project name}} stays "on the outside". Very few internal modifications are made to Tor Browser as described in the [[Tor_Browser#Whonix_.E2.84.A2_Tor_Browser_Differences|{{Project name}} Tor Browser Differences]] chapter.

To remedy this kind of issue, there are three promising approaches.

=== Delete and Reinstall Tor Browser ===

If browser settings like bookmarks, saved passwords and so on are not too important, Tor Browser can be completely deleted and reinstalled. Tor Browser usually functions normally after this procedure. The easiest method is using [[Tor_Browser#Tor_Browser_Downloader_by_Whonix_.E2.84.A2|Tor Browser Downloader by {{project name}}]] for this process.

=== Attempt to Debug the Issue ===

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = Debugging attempts are not guaranteed to work, but are encouraged to help fix outstanding issues. It is suggested to directly contact The Tor Project to report the issue and any outcome/s.
}}

Advanced users can try to start Tor Browser without the help of <code>/usr/bin/torbrowser</code> by {{project name}}, thereby bypassing that part of {{project name}} Tor Browser integration. Tor Browser resides in folder <code>~/.tb/tor-browser</code>. Therefore Tor Browser can be launched in [[Tor_Browser#In_Debugging_Mode|Debugging Mode]], which is a Tor Browser (not {{project name}}) feature.

Additionally, the whole <code>~/.tb/tor-browser</code> folder could be copied to a Debian <code>buster</code> machine or better yet, a virtual machine. For better security, a virtual machine might even be non-networked before attempts are made to launch Tor Browser. This error is likely to be reproducible outside {{project name}} and this step will provide confirmation.

During debug attempts, do not use <code>/usr/bin/torbrowser</code> or the Tor Browser start menu entry because these are provided by {{project name}} and are not the cause here. On the other hand, The Tor Project is responsible for errors that emerge when Tor Browser is started manually or in debug mode.

Be aware the [https://trac.torproject.org/ Tor Bug Tracker] already has various, existing bug reports related to incremental updates via the Tor Browser internal updater. These are most likely related to Tor Browser launch failures:

* https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/29771
* https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/16028
* https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?component=Applications%2FTor+Browser&summary=~incremental&max=500&order=priority
* https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?component=Applications%2FTor+Browser&summary=~update&max=500&order=priority

=== Backup and Restore Browser Settings ===

Steps to perform a backup and restore of browser settings (like bookmarks) is currently [[undocumented]] in the {{project name}} wiki. However, any online instructions for this process in Tor Browser or even Firefox should equally apply in {{project name}}. The only difference is the {{project name}} Tor Browser folder location: <code>~/.tb/tor-browser</code>.

== Close Tor Browser ==

Sometimes the following error message appears when no Tor Browser window is open.

'''Figure:''' ''Running Tor Browser Instance''
[[File:Tor browser already running.png]]

<blockquote>Tor Browser is already running, but is not responding. To use Tor Browser, you must first close the existing Tor Browser process, restart your device, or use a different profile.</blockquote>

Most likely Tor Browser is still/already running in the background but without a visible desktop environment window due to an existing software bug.

To kill the Tor Browser process, run the following command.

{{CodeSelect|code=
pkill firefox.real
}}

== Why do I have White Bars around my Tor Browser Content? ==

Users who [[Tor_Browser#Unsafe_Tor_Browser_Habits|ignore advice]] to not maximize/resize the Tor Browser window will now notice white borders surrounding the Tor Browser content: <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/is-anyone-having-white-bars-in-the-tbb-tor-browser-letterboxing/8345</ref>

<blockquote>Ever since 9 update I have had white bars at the bottom and top of my browser. Even with using the TBB on non-whonix I still have them. Am I the only one & am I exposed?</blockquote>

This is not an [[Malware_and_Firmware_Trojans#Detection_of_System_Changes|indicator of compromise]], but a new fingerprinting defense called [https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-90 Letterboxing]:

<blockquote>Tor Browser in its default mode is starting with a content window rounded to a multiple of 200px x 100px to prevent fingerprinting the screen dimensions.

Tor Browser 9 ships with a fingerprinting defense for those scenarios as well, which is called [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letterboxing_(filming) Letterboxing], a technique developed by Mozilla and presented [https://www.zdnet.com/article/firefox-to-add-tor-browser-anti-fingerprinting-technique-called-letterboxing/ earlier this year]. It works by adding white margins to a browser window so that the window is as close as possible to the desired size while users are still in a couple of screen size buckets that prevent singling them out with the help of screen dimensions.</blockquote>

== Tor Browser Consumes 100% CPU after Clock Sync or Suspend/Resume ==

An upstream [https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/29497 bug] in Tor Browser causes the <code>firefox.real</code> process to consume excessive CPU whenever the connection to Tor's <code>ControlPort</code> is broken, which continues until Tor Browser is restarted. This is known to occur when the [[sdwdate]] clock synchronization daemon is restarted in Whonix-Gateway, whether manually via the [[sdwdate-gui]] time synchronization systray, or automatically via post-resume hooks. For details, refer to the related forum [http://forums.whonix.org/t/bug-restart-of-sdwdate-in-whonix-gateway-causes-100-cpu-use-of-tor-browser-in-whonix-workstation/9541/18 discussion]. ([https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/4969 original report on Qubes issue tracker])

As a workaround:

# Open <code>about:config</code> in the Tor Browser URL bar.
# Search for and set <code>extensions.torbutton.display_circuit</code> to <code>false</code>.
# Restart Tor Browser.

== Permission Issues ==
<ref>
https://www.reddit.com/r/Whonix/comments/ky7jqr/troubleshooting_i_just_installed_whonix_when_i/
</ref>

<u>Tip</u>: If something does not work, do not arbitrarily try to use sudo / root without indication that this would be appropriate. That only risks messing up user home folder permissions. See [[Root#Inappropriate_Use_of_Root_Rights|Inappropriate Use of Root Rights]].

<u>Attempt to fix</u>:

'''1.''' {{Open a product ws terminal}}

'''2.''' Owner Permissions Fix

Run the following command to reset permissions of user <code>user</code>'s home folder <code>/home/user</code> back to owner <code>user</code> and group <code>user</code>. That command is often sufficient to fix previous inappropriate use of root rights issues.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo chown --recursive user:user /home/user
}}

'''3.''' Folder Permission Fix

If that does not resolve permission issues, run the following slightly more experimental command to set <code>chmod</code> [https://chmodcommand.com/chmod-770/ <code>0770</code>] on all folders inside the user <code>user</code>'s home folder. <ref>
* As per Debian default [https://wiki.debian.org/UserPrivateGroups <u>u</u>ser <u>p</u>rivate <u>g</u>roups UPGs] each created user will be given their own group to use. Therefore <code>chmod</code> [https://chmodcommand.com/chmod-700/ <code>0700</code>] is not required and <code>chmod</code> <code>0770</code> is OK for all folders inside the user home folder.
* The following command <code>find</code>s all directories inside user home folder <code>/home/user</code> and sets the "executable" bit on them. If that seems strange or a security issue, it's not, see [https://askubuntu.com/questions/443789/what-does-chmod-x-filename-do-and-how-do-i-use-it Why must a folder be executable?]. It also grants user <code>user</code> and UPG <code>user</code> the required read and write access inside the user home folder.
</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
find /home/user -type d -print0 {{!}} xargs -0 chmod 0770
}}

'''4.''' Files Permission Fix

Similar to the previous step, if that does not resolve permission issues, run the following slightly more experimental command to grant user <code>user</code> read and write access on all files inside the user <code>user</code>'s home folder. This may have some disadvantages. The only known example is for users of <code>git</code>. See footnote for further information. <ref>
Some applications might create write protected files inside the user's home folder.

As user. Do not do this. It is just an example for explanation!

{{CodeSelect|code=
rm -r .git
}}

<pre>
rm: remove write-protected regular file '.git/objects/1c/f2f7161f7529fd600a706278e06df20eb6dfd6'
</pre>

After running the following command, this protection would be gone. In that case, the user is free to modify the following command to have a more narrow scope, for example.

{{CodeSelect|code=
chmod --recursive ug+rw /home/user/.tb
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
chmod --recursive ug+rw /home/user/.cache/tb
}}
</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
chmod --recursive ug+rw /home/user
}}

'''6.''' Done.

Chances are good that permission issues have been resolved. Try starting Tor Browser. In case the issue is persisting, the following options could be considered.

<u>Attempt to debug</u>:

Start Tor Browser Start by {{project name}} in [[#In Verbose Mode|In Verbose Mode]]. This will show verbose output messages which might be useful for the user to identify the issue. In doubt, [[Support]] might help interpreting these messages.

<u>Other options</u>:

* [[#Delete and Reinstall Tor Browser|Delete and Reinstall Tor Browser]]
* [[Tor_Browser/Manual_Download|Tor Browser Manual Download]]
* [[Factory Reset]], re-install method

= Glossary and Key Terminology =
== Glossary ==
It is recommended to become familiar with terms regularly used by The Tor Project and {{project_name}}. One useful resource is the [https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/community/glossary v1.0 Tor glossary] which is now available on The Tor Project community wiki page.

== Key Terminology ==
=== Tor vs Tor Browser ===

[[Tor]] is an anonymizer developed by The Tor Project. Tor Browser is a web browser developed by the Tor Project which is optimized for privacy. Please do not confuse {{Code2|Tor}} with {{Code2|Tor Browser}} when conversing about {{project_name}} topics.

=== Tor Browser Transparent Proxying ===

The Tor Browser "transparent proxying" feature <ref>https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/TransparentProxy</ref> and/or the environment variable <code>TOR_TRANSPROXY=1</code> often cause confusion. It was an unfortunate naming decision by The Tor Project. This feature actually <u>[[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#Remove_Proxy_Settings|removes proxy settings]]</u>. With no proxy set, the user's system reverts to its default configuration. The effect of this decision is that Tor Browser networking will work in a similar fashion to an unconfigured Firefox browser.

This is potentially dangerous when done outside of {{project_name}} because Tor Browser's transparent proxying feature could result in clearnet traffic; for instance if the gateway does not have a transparent torification feature (like {{gateway_product_name}}). In the case of {{project_name}}, even if the transparent proxying feature is set, {{gateway_product_name}} will "torify" traffic and force it through Tor. Similarly, if transparent proxying is set and happens to use a JonDo-Gateway, traffic will be forced through JonDo.

One downside of the transparent proxying feature is that even when it is used inside {{project_name}}, it breaks Tor Browser's [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3455 top level isolation for each separate tab].

Transparent proxying should not be confused with:

* Tor's <code>TransPort [address:]port|auto [isolation flags]</code> [https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en setting].
* Tor's [https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/TorifyHOWTO/IsolatingProxy IsolatingProxy].
