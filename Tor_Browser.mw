[[Image:torbrowser.png|400px|Tor Browser, privacy by design. Fighting web fingerprinting and linkability.|thumb]]
= Introduction =
It is recommended<ref>Reasons? See below.</ref>, that you use only Tor Browser for browsing the web in Whonix.

Tor Browser<ref>https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en</ref> is a fork<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)</ref> of the Mozilla Firefox<ref>http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/</ref> web browser, optimized<ref>https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/</ref> and designed<ref>https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/en/design/</ref> for anonymity, developed by The Tor Project<ref>https://www.torproject.org/</ref>. Given Firefox's popularity, many of you have probably used it before and its user interface is like any other modern web browser.

Here are a few things worth mentioning in the context of Whonix.

= Anonymity vs Pseudonymity =
When you were to use other browsers than Tor Browser, your IP/DNS would still be protected by Whonix, but you wouldn't profit from Tor Browser's protocol level cleanup. Using other browsers would be [[DoNot#Do_not_confuse_Anonymity_with_Pseudonymity.|pseudonymous rather than anonymous]].

Tor Browser in comparison to other browsers is optimized for anonymity, it contains privacy enhancing patches<ref>https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#firefox-patches</ref> and add-ons<ref>See below.</ref>. There are no other browsers other than Tor Browser capable of protocol level cleanup. When you use Tor Browser, you will blend in and share the [[Fingerprint]] of other Tor Browser users, which is a good thing.

= HTTPS Encryption =

Using HTTPS instead of HTTP encrypts your communication while browsing the web.

All the data exchanged between your browser and the server you are visiting are encrypted. It prevents the [[Warning#Tor_exit_nodes_can_eavesdrop_on_communications|Tor exit relay to eavesdrop on your communications]].

HTTPS also includes mechanisms to authenticate the server you are communicating with. But those mechanisms can be flawed, [[Warning#Man-in-the-middle_attacks|as explained on our warning page]].

For example, here is how the browser looks like when we try to log in an email account at lavabit.com<ref>http://lavabit.com/</ref>, using their interface<ref>https://lavabit.com/apps/webmail/src/login.php webmail</ref>:

[[Image:lavabit.png]]

Notice the small area on the left of the address bar saying "lavabit.com" on a blue background and the address beginning with "https://" (instead of "http://"):

[[Image:address-bar.png]]

These are the indicators that an encrypted connection using HTTPS<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure</ref> is being used.

You should try to only use services providing HTTPS when you are sending or retrieving sensitive information (like passwords), otherwise it's very easy for an eavesdropper to steal whatever information you are sending or to modify the content of a page on its way to your browser.

= HTTPS Everywhere =

[[Image:https-everywhere.jpg|HTTPS Everywhere logo|thumb]]

HTTPS Everywhere<ref>https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere</ref> is a Firefox extension shipped in Tor Browser and produced as a collaboration between The Tor Project<ref>https://torproject.org/</ref> and the Electronic Frontier Foundation<ref>https://eff.org/</ref>. It encrypts your communications with a number of major websites. Many sites on the web offer some limited support for encryption over HTTPS, but make it difficult to use. For instance, they may default to unencrypted HTTP, or fill encrypted pages with links that go back to the unencrypted site. The HTTPS Everywhere extension fixes these problems by rewriting all requests to these sites to HTTPS.

To learn more about HTTPS Everywhere you can see:

* the [https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere HTTPS Everywhere homepage]
* the [https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere/faq/ HTTPS Everywhere FAQ]

= Torbutton =

Tor alone is not enough to protect your anonymity and privacy while browsing the web. All modern web browsers, such as Firefox, support JavaScript<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript</ref>, Adobe Flash<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash</ref>, cookies<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie</ref> and other features which have been shown to be able to defeat the anonymity <ref>[[DoNot#Do_not_confuse_Anonymity_with_Pseudonymity.]].</ref> provided by the Tor network.

In Tor Browser all such features are handled from inside the browser, because it's a modified version of Firefox Patches<ref>https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/WebBrowsers</ref> and it contains an extension called Torbutton<ref>https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/</ref>. These do all sorts of things to prevent the above type of attacks. But that comes at a price: since this will disable some functionalities and some sites might not work as intended. Don't worry too much about this, the vast majority of websites works very well.

To learn more about Torbutton you can see:

* [https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/ the Torbutton homepage]
* [https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/torbutton-faq.html.en the Torbutton FAQ]

To learn more about Data Collection Techniques, Fingerprinting you can see:

* [[Data Collection Techniques]]

= New Identity Button =
The New Identity button on Tor Browser isn't perfect yet (NOT a Whonix issue), there are open bugs.<ref>See [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=needs_information&status=needs_review&status=new&status=reopened&order=priority&col=id&col=summary&col=keywords&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&keywords=tbb-linkability tbb-linkability] and [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=needs_review&status=needs_revision&status=new&status=reopened&order=priority&col=id&col=summary&col=keywords&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&keywords=tbb-fingerprinting tbb-fingerprinting].</ref>

= Protection against dangerous JavaScript =

Having all JavaScript disabled by default would disable a lot of harmless and possibly useful JavaScript and render unusable many websites. This would scare away lots of potential users "because it just doesn't work". Torbutton disables all potentially dangerous JavaScript. On the other hand, having a big user base is important for good anonymity as this very interesting mail by Roger Dingledine explains.<ref>http://www.mail-archive.com/liberationtech@lists.stanford.edu/msg00022.html</ref>

That's why '''JavaScript is enabled by default''' in Tor Browser. We consider this as a necessary compromise between security and usability and as of today we are not aware of any JavaScript that would compromise Whonix anonymity.

For more technical details you can refer to the Torbutton design document.<ref>https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/en/design/</ref> Another related discussion justifying why JavaScript is enabled by default in Tor Browser was on tor-talk, "Tor Browser disabling Javascript anonymity set reduction".<ref>https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-May/024227.html</ref>

= NoScript =

[[Image:noscript.png|NoScript logo|thumb]]

NoScript also comes with Tor Browser and provides many protections, even though JavaScript is enabled by default. You shouldn't mess with NoScript settings in Tor Browser unless you exactly know what you are doing.

For more information you can refer to the NoScript [http://noscript.net/ website] and [http://noscript.net/features features].

= Tips =
== Maximizing Browser Window ==
It [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7255 might] be better for privacy and anonymity not to maximize the Tor Browser window.

= Tor Browser in Whonix differences =
== Introduction ==
The regular Tor Browser Bundle and Tor Browser in Whonix slightly differ. The environment Tor Browser is running in has been adjusted by Whonix to work behind the Whonix-Gateway. The network and browser fingerprint however, is the same.

Tor Browser's internal update check mechanism is untouched and works fine. Default homepage is currently blank instead of original about:tor. <ref>This is because Whonix's torbrowser starter starts Tor Browser with about:blank as start page. in Whonix 8, Tor Browser's homepage setting is untouched.</ref>

== Whonix Proxy Settings ==
'''Short''':
You don't need to change any proxy settings in Tor Browser.

'''Long''': <ref>
There is no Tor over Tor in Whonix, which would be [[DoNot#Prevent_Tor_over_Tor_scenarios.|recommended against]], due to Whonix's environment. Whonix does not modify Tor Browser's startup script, defaults, etc. In Whonix-Workstation rinetd listens on {{Code2|127.0.0.1}} {{Code2|9150}} and {{Code2|9151}} (TBB's default ports) and forwards them to Whonix-Gateway {{Code2|192.168.0.10 9150}} (where a Tor SocksPort is listening) and {{Code2|9151}} (where [[Dev/CPFP|Control Port Filter Proxy]] is listening). Tor does not get started by the {{Code2|[https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor-launcher.git torbrowser-launcher]}} Firefox add-on because the {{Code2|[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6009 TOR_SKIP_LAUNCH]}} environment variable has been set set to {{Code2|1}}. See also [[Dev/Dummy_Tor]].
</ref>

== More than one Tor Browser in Whonix ==
For better isolation of different identities. For advanced users. Moved to the [[Advanced_Security_Guide#More_than_one_Tor_Browser_in_Whonix|Advanced Security Guide]].

= Update Tor Browser =

== Introduction ==

There is no auto-update feature for Tor Browser. You will be notified about new Tor Browser versions by [[whonixcheck]]. Additionally, Tor Browser's built in stock update notification mechanism also works in Whonix. Additionally it might also be wise to subscribe to https://blog.torproject.org for news.

== Updating ==
[[File:Tor Browser Update Check_001.png|Tor Browser Updater (Whonix) checking for updates.|thumb]]
[[File:Tor Browser Update Check_002.png|Tor Browser Updater (Whonix) Update Notification|thumb]]
[[File:Tor Browser Update Check_003.png|Tor Browser Updater (Whonix) downloading.|thumb]]
[[File:Tor Browser Update Check_004.png|Tor Browser Updater (Whonix) update done.|thumb]]
[[File:Tor Browser Update Check_005.png|Tor Browser Updater (Whonix) in Terminal|thumb]]

Tor Browser version check and update (after confirmation) in Whonix can be done with:

<pre>
Applications -> System -> Tor Browser Updater
</pre>

A future update of Tor Browser by The Tor Project might make Whonix's Tor Browser Updater or Tor Browser running in Whonix-Workstation unusable. In case Tor Browser (Updater) inside Whonix-Workstation breaks, a news with instructions on how to fix the issue will be posted within a few days. If not, the Whonix developers are not aware of the issue.

If the Tor Browser update script is ever broken, you are advised to update manually, see [[Manually Updating Tor Browser]].

= Not installed by Default =
Tor Browser is not installed by default anymore. <ref>

Licensing reasons:

* Mozilla trademark: https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/10888
* The Tor Project trademark: https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/TPO_Trademark

Security reasons:

* Forces the user to get an up to date version of Tor Browser. By the time users download Whonix, mostly the shipped version of Tor Browser would be already outdated.

Technical reasons:

* Users who build Whonix from source code won't have issues with a build script that is broken, just because of issues with downloading Tor Browser.
</ref>

= Local Connections =
'''Note''', accessing 127.0.0.1 {{Tor_Browser_Local_Connections}}.

= Browser Plugins / Flash / Java =

See [[Browser Plugins]].

= Browser Language =
If you want the browser interface in a different language than English, see [[Language]].

= Advanced Topics =
== Verify New Identity ==
'''This is an advanced topic. You most likely only need it in custom configurations, such as when using a [[Other Operating Systems|Whonix-Custom-Workstation]].'''

First of all, should it have failed, TorButton should notice, that it could not connect to Tor's ControlPort and should report, that giving a new identity failed. If you don't get such an error popup, it is a good indication, that there are no issues.

After the browser restarted, on the about:tor page, click "Test Tor Network Settings". It will lead to https://check.torproject.org (check.tpo) (or manually visit check.tpo, it doesn't matter.). In most cases (Not all! <ref>Getting a new circuit, doesn't guarantee getting a new exit relay. This is normal. See also [[Stream_ solation]].</ref>) you should have a new exit relay. Check.tpo should report different IP.

On Whonix-Gateway, watch [[Dev/CPFP|Control Port Filter Proxy]]'s log while using TorButton's New Identity feature.

<pre>
tail -f /var/log/controlportfilt.log
</pre>

If you see something like this.

<pre>
916aad59-f05d-4b26-b1bd-70f598719774 GOT: SIGNAL NEWNYM
916aad59-f05d-4b26-b1bd-70f598719774 BACK: 250 OK
</pre>

Then Control Port Filter Proxy received the request from Tor Browser and got Tor's okay, that it worked.

== Get New Identity without Tor ControlPort Access ==
'''This is an advanced topic. You most likely only need it in custom configurations, such as when not using [[Dev/CPFP|Control Port Filter Proxy]].'''

Simulate, what TorButton would do.

1. Close Tor Browser. <br />
2. Get new identity on Whonix-Gateway using [[Tor Controller|arm]]. <br />
3. Start Tor Browser again. <br />
4. Done.

== Change/Remove Proxy Settings ==
'''This is an advanced topic. You most likely only need it for advanced tunneling scenarios.'''

You could either:

* Use Tor Button's -> Preferences to set it to any other proxy or no proxy. {{Code2|Transparent Torification}} means, "no proxy" or in other words it means "use whatever the system system provides".
* For an alternative method, setting {{Code2|Transparent Torification}} which does not involve Tor Button's graphical user interface, see footnote <ref>
<!--Keeping that, in case Tor Button's settings dialog breaks again.-->
If you want to set it to no proxy, you could either:

* additionally add in ~/tor-browser_en-US/start-tor-browser below "#!/bin/sh".

<pre>export TOR_TRANSPROXY=1</pre>

* Or add to /etc/environment

<pre>TOR_TRANSPROXY=1</pre>

and reboot.
</ref>.
* Forget about Tor Button's -> Open Network Settings. See footnote, if you want to know why.<ref>
When using the regular Tor Browser Bundle from The Tor Project without Whonix, that menu can be used to change network settings inside Tor. It has the same effects as editing Tor's config file torrc. Using this graphical user interface isn't possible in Whonix, because for security reasons, in Whonix there is only limited access to Tor's control port. (See [[Dev/CPFP]] for more information.) (You could change such settings manually in /etc/tor/torrc on Whonix-Gateway. (See also [[Features#VPN_.2F_Tunnel_support|VPN/Tunnel suppprt]] for more information.)
</ref>

== tor-launcher vs torbrowser-launcher ==
Two totally different things with similar names.

* [https://micahflee.com/torbrowser-launcher/ torbrowser-launcher] ([https://micahflee.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/tbl.png screenshot]) is an application to download the Tor Browser Bundle (TBB), an alternative to [https://github.com/Whonix/tb-updater tb-updater].
* [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-May/004761.html tor-launcher] ([http://trial.pearlcrescent.com/tor/torlauncher/2013-05-03/SetupWizard/wizard-all.png screenshots] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6RVFMxzEf w])) is a Tor Controller, a [https://www.torproject.org/projects/vidalia.html.en Vidalia] replacement, an add-on that is included in TBB by default.

== tor-launcher ==
In case you are wondering if tor-launcher will result in [[DoNot#Prevent_Tor_over_Tor_scenarios.|Tor over Tor]]... No, because Tor Browser and Whonix [[Tor_Browser#Whonix_Proxy_Settings|play well together]].

Can or should you remove tor-launcher from TBB? So in theory it makes no difference. In practice, it is untested and seems to provide no advantages. Just leave it enabled to have the same tested setup as everyone else.

== torbrowser-launcher ==
[https://github.com/Whonix/tb-updater tb-updater] (installed by default in Whonix) is specifically designed to be co-installable with torbrowser-launcher. Maybe one day Whonix will deprecate tb-updater and install torbrowser-launcher by default, see [https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,404.0.html forum development discussion] if that is of interest to you.
