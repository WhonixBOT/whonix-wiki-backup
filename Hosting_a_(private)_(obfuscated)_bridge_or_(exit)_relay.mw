|description=Hosting a (private) (obfuscated) bridge or (exit) relay using Whonix
}}

== Introduction ==

You can still volunteer to Tor and host a bridge, private bridge, obfuscated bridge, private obfuscated bridge, middle node or exit relay when you are using Whonix. Either inside the Whonix-Gateway or directly on the host.

== Inside the Whonix-Gateway ==
This chapter hasn't been tested for a long time. Get in contact if you are interested in this configuration.

Simply follow all the usual instructions given on torproject.org inside the Whonix-Gateway just as you would, if Tor wouldn't run inside a virtual machine. The only additional thing to do is to set up a port forwarding from the host to the virtual machine. That is simple. It's a VirtualBox feature. You can also do this with the VirtualBox graphical user interface. Go to Whonix-Gateway -> Settings -> Network Interface -> Port Forwarding.

What's left are the firewall rules. On the Whonix-Gateway look at [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_gateway/etc/whonix_firewall.d/30_default {{Code|/etc/whonix_firewall/30_default}}]. Read the introduction comment (which is about [[Whonix_Configuration_Files|Whonix flexible modular configuration files]]) and Tor Relay Settings.

Open {{Code|/etc/whonix_firewall/50_user}}.

<pre>
kdesudo kwrite /etc/whonix_firewall/50_user
</pre>

Paste the following content. Adjust if necessary.

<pre>
## Allow incoming DIRPORT connections for an optional Tor relay.
GATEWAY_ALLOW_INCOMING_DIR_PORT=1

## Allow incoming ORPORT connections for an optional Tor relay.
GATEWAY_ALLOW_INCOMING_OR_PORT=1

## DIRPORT incoming port.
DIR_PORT=80

## ORPORT incoming port.
OR_PORT=443
</pre>

Reload Whonix firewall.

<pre>
sudo whonix_firewall
</pre>
