|description=Hosting a (private) (obfuscated) bridge or (exit) relay using Whonix
}}

== Introduction ==

You can still volunteer to Tor and host a bridge, private bridge, obfuscated bridge, private obfuscated bridge, middle node or exit relay when you are using Whonix. Either inside the Whonix-Gateway or directly on the host.

== Inside the Whonix-Gateway ==
This chapter hasn't been tested for a long time. Get in contact if you are interested in this configuration.

Simply follow all the usual instructions given on torproject.org inside the Whonix-Gateway just as you would, if Tor wouldn't run inside a virtual machine. The only additional thing to do is to set up a port forwarding from the host to the virtual machine. That is simple. It's a VirtualBox feature. You can also do this with the VirtualBox graphical user interface. Go to Whonix-Gateway -> Settings -> Network Interface -> Port Forwarding.

What's left are the firewall rules. On the Whonix-Gateway look at {{Code|/etc/whonix_firewall/30_default}} and look out for.

<pre>GATEWAY_ALLOW_INCOMMING_SSH=0</pre>

And change that to

<pre>GATEWAY_ALLOW_INCOMMING_SSH=1</pre>

Scroll down to

<pre>
if [ "$GATEWAY_ALLOW_INCOMMING_SSH" = "1" ]; then
    iptables -A INPUT -i "$EXT_IF" -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
fi
</pre>

and add

<pre>
# Tor
iptables -A INPUT -i $EXT_IF -p tcp --dport YOURPORT -j ACCEPT
</pre>
