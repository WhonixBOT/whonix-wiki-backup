It has a legal background. Total exclusion of liability is not possible under German law. The idea was "make sure that someone who tries to misunderstand, has no chance to misunderstand".

Due to technological improvements there are now a lot less work places. This is awesome. But due to social, economical, political dislocations the people don't work less hours, but come up with useless income-only places that don't come up with real products. Since this is not widely understood yet, I think big industries that only waste a lot of paper emerged. Including a wide variety of lawyers who make their living by suing people for things no one, not even themselves, really cares for. I think in Germany were quite "advanced" in this field. Maybe US patents justice is "superior".

The text is tailored to my understanding of German law after extensive research. It is so clear and so much in their face, that I should be under the laws that apply to implied (non-written) contracts of absolute gifts.
