== On Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation ==

=== Change Passwords ===

'''The default username is:''' '''''user'''''

'''The default password is:''' '''''changeme'''''

Immediately change it!

Login as root:

<pre>sudo su</pre><references/>

Change root and user password:

<pre>
passwd
passwd user
</pre>

and follow the instructions.

=== Security Updates ===

Regularly check for '''security updates''' and apply them with:

<pre>sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade</pre>

== Network Time Syncing ==
Don't wonder... To prevent against time zone leaks, the system clock inside Whonix was set to UTC. This means it may be a few hours before or ahead of your host system clock. Do not change!

When you use the pause/suspend/save/resume feature of VirtualBox or the hibernate feature of your host operating system, while Whonix-Workstation was running, you should manually run TimeSync afterwards!<ref>This is because the clock will be incorrect after resume. A correct clock is important for anonymity (See [[Dev/TimeSync]] if you want to know why.)</ref>

<pre>
Start Menu -> Applications -> System -> Whonix TimeSync
</pre>

Its recommended against to pause/suspend/save/hibernate Whonix-Gateway, because it will be difficult to restore the clock after resume.

If your host clock is more than 1 hour in past or more than 3 hour in future, Tor can't connect. In this case fix your host clock manually (right click on clock). (Check for empty battery.) Then power off Whonix-Gateway and power Whonix-Gateway on again, Tor should be able to connect again. If your host clock is even more off, you could get into trouble updating your host operating system so have an eye on it that it's somewhat accurate.

This chapter is supposed to be as simple and short as possible to provide basic protection. You can achieve more security if you understand the [[Advanced_Security_Guide#Network_Time_Synchronization | Network Time Synchronization]] chapter from the Advanced Security Guide.
