== On Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation ==
=== Change Passwords ===
{{mbox

}}
<br />
<div class>
After Whonix has finished installing, immediately change the passwords for both the user {{Code2|user}} and user {{Code2|root}} accounts.

Open a terminal (such as Konsole).

<code>Start menu</code> -> <code>Applications</code> -> <code>System</code> -> <code>Terminal</code>

Login as root.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo su
}}

{{Default_Passwords}}
<br />
Change the root and user passwords.

{{CodeSelect|code=
passwd
}}
{{CodeSelect|code=
passwd user
}}

And follow the instructions.
</div>

=== Security Updates ===

Regularly check for security updates and apply them in a timely fashion; see [[Update#Updates|Operating System Updates]].

== Network Time Syncing ==

To restart <code>sdwdate</code>.

<code>Start Menu</code> -> <code>Applications</code> -> <code>System</code> -> <code>Time Synchronization Monitor (sdwdate-gui)</code> -> <code>restart sdwdate</code>

Or in a terminal.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo /usr/lib/sdwdate/restart_fresh
}}

If the host clock (in UTC! <ref>
In Linux, the user can view the system time in UTC by running:
{{CodeSelect|code=
date --utc
}}
</ref>
<ref>
TODO: [https://phabricator.whonix.org/T71 Show desktop clock in local time; keep system in UTC]
</ref>) is more than 1 hour in the past or more than 3 hours in the future, Tor cannot connect. In this case, manually fix the host clock by right-clicking on it, and also check for an empty battery. Then, power off and power on the Whonix-Gateway (<code>sys-whonix</code>) and Tor should be able to reconnect. If the host clock is grossly inaccurate, the user might experience problems when updating the host operating system, so periodically check it is (roughly) correct.

== Better Security ==

This chapter is intended to be a short and simple overview to provide basic protection for newcomers. Anonymity and platform security can be improved by following recommendations outlined in the Security Guide and Advanced Security Guide sections, along with the [[Network_Time_Synchronization|Network Time Synchronization]] page.
