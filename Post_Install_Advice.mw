* {{workstation_product_name}}: No changes required for most users.
* {{gateway_product_name}}: If you have enough RAM on the host, ideally users should increase the virtual RAM setting of {{gateway_product_name}} to <code>2048</code> MB RAM. <ref>

<div class>
After {{project name}} has finished installing, immediately change the passwords for both the user <code>user</code> and user <code>root</code> accounts.
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Open a terminal (such as Konsole).

<code>Start menu</code> &rarr; <code>Applications</code> &rarr; <code>System</code> &rarr; <code>Terminal</code>

'''2.''' Login as root. 

Run. <ref name=pwd_change>Type the command in the terminal and press <code><Enter></code>.</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo su
}}

'''3.''' Read the note below regarding the username and password.
{{Default_Passwords}}

When typing the password it will <u>not</u> appear on the screen, nor will the asterisk sign (<code>*</code>) be visible. It is necessary to type blindly and trust the procedure.

'''4.''' Change the root password.

To change the <code>root</code> (superuser / administrator) password, run. <ref name=pwd_change />

{{CodeSelect|code=
passwd
}}

'''5.''' Change the user password.

To change the <code>user</code> ({{project name}} default user) password, run. <ref name=pwd_change />

{{CodeSelect|code=
passwd user
}}

And follow the instructions.

== Security Updates ==

Regularly check for security updates and apply them in a timely fashion; see [[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates#Updates|Operating System Updates]].

= Network Time Syncing =

== Warnings ==

Follow the platform-specific recommendations below to avoid Tor connectivity problems and to limit possible adverse anonymity impacts.

=== All Platforms ===
To protect against time zone leaks, the system clock inside {{project name}} is set to UTC. This means it may be a few hours before or ahead of your host system clock. <u>Do not change this setting!</u>

If the host clock (in UTC! <ref>
To view the system time in UTC on Linux platforms, run.
{{CodeSelect|code=
date --utc
}}
</ref> <ref>
TODO: [https://phabricator.whonix.org/T71 Show desktop clock in local time; keep system in UTC]</ref>) is more than 1 hour in the past or more than 3 hours in the future, Tor cannot connect. In this case, manually fix the host clock by right-clicking on it, and also check for an empty battery. Then, power off and power on the {{gateway_product_name}} (<code>sys-whonix</code>) and Tor should be able to reconnect. If the host clock is grossly inaccurate, the user might experience problems when updating the host operating system, so periodically check it is (roughly) correct.

=== Easy instructions ===
<u>{{non_q_project_name_short}}:</u> It is strongly discouraged to use the pause / suspend / save / hibernate features.

<u>{{q_project_name}}:</u> It is strongly discouraged to use the pause feature of Qube Manager, but it is is safe to use the suspend or hibernate feature of dom0.

=== Advanced instructions ===
If you are interested in using the pause / suspend / save / hibernate features, please click the expand button for further instructions.
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
<u>{{non_q_project_name_short}}:</u>
* It is strongly discouraged to pause / suspend / save / hibernate the {{gateway_product_name}}, because it is difficult to restore the clock after resume. <ref name=gateway_pause>This is because the clock will be incorrect after system resume. A correct clock is important for anonymity (see [[Dev/TimeSync]] to learn more).</ref>
* It is strongly discouraged to pause / suspend / save / hibernate the {{workstation_product_name}}. If this advice is ignored, [[#Restart sdwdate|restart sdwdate]] after resume.
<u>{{q_project_name}}:</u>
* It is strongly discouraged to pause {{gateway_product_name}} (<code>sys-whonix</code>) using the pause feature of Qube Manager, because it is difficult to restore the clock after resume. <ref name=gateway_pause />
* It is strongly discouraged to pause {{workstation_product_name}} (<code>anon-whonix</code>) using the pause feature of Qube Manager. If this advice is ignored, [[#Restart sdwdate|restart sdwdate]] after resume. <ref>
Qubes does not dispatch the <code>/etc/qubes/suspend-post.d</code> / <code>/etc/qubes/suspend-pre.d</code> hooks upon pause / resume using Qube Manager.
</ref>
* It is safe to use the suspend or hibernate feature of dom0 and a manual restart of sdwdate is unnecessary. <ref>

== Restart sdwdate ==

To restart <code>sdwdate</code>.

<code>Start Menu</code> &rarr; <code>Applications</code> &rarr; <code>System</code> &rarr; <code>Time Synchronization Monitor (sdwdate-gui)</code> &rarr; <code>restart sdwdate</code>

Or in a terminal. <ref>This process was simplified in {{project_name}} 15 and only requires one command, instead of two, see: https://github.com/Whonix/sdwdate/blob/master/usr/lib/sdwdate/restart_fresh</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo /usr/lib/sdwdate/restart_fresh

= Better Security =

This chapter is aimed at newcomers and only provides a short and simple overview for basic protection. Anonymity and platform security can be improved by following recommendations outlined in the Security Guide and Advanced Security Guide sections, along with the [[Network_Time_Synchronization|Network Time Synchronization]] page.

= Appendix =

== How do I Check the Current {{project name}} Version? ==

See <code>/etc/whonix_version</code>.

==== {{gateway_product_name}} ====

{{Open_a _product_gw_terminal}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
cat /etc/whonix_version
}}

Should show.

<code>{{VersionShort}}</code>

==== {{workstation_product_name}} ====

{{Open_a _product_ws_terminal}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
cat /etc/whonix_version
}}

Should show.

<code>{{VersionShort}}</code>
