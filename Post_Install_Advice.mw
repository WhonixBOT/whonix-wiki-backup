== On Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation ==
=== Change Passwords ===
{{mbox

}}
<br />
<div class>
As soon as Whonix is installed, change the passwords for both of the following accounts: user {{Code2|user}} and user {{Code2|root}}.

Open a terminal (such as Konsole).

<code>Start menu</code> -> <code>Applications</code> -> <code>System</code> -> <code>Terminal</code>

Login as root.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo su
}}

{{Default_Passwords}}
<br />
Change the root and user passwords.

{{CodeSelect|code=
passwd
}}
{{CodeSelect|code=
passwd user
}}

And follow the instructions.
</div>

=== Security Updates ===

Regularly check for security updates and apply them in a timely fashion. See [[Update#Updates|Operating System Updates]].

== Network Time Syncing ==
To prevent against time zone leaks, the system clock inside Whonix is set to UTC. This means it may be a few hours before or ahead of your host system clock. '''Do not change this setting!'''

While Whonix-Workstation is running, if the user selects the pause / suspend / save / resume feature of the virtualizer or the hibernate feature on the host operating system, then manually run TimeSync afterwards! <ref>This is because the clock will be incorrect after system resume. A correct clock is important for anonymity (see [[Dev/TimeSync]] to learn why).</ref>

<code>Start Menu</code> -> <code>Applications</code> -> <code>System</code> -> <code>Time Synchronization Monitor (sdwdate-gui)</code>

Or in a terminal.

{{CodeSelect|code=
TODO: document
}}

It is not recommended to pause / suspend / save / hibernate the Whonix-Gateway, because it is difficult to restore the clock after resume.

If the host clock (in UTC! <ref>
On Linux, the user can view your system time in UTC by using:
{{CodeSelect|code=
date --utc
}}
</ref>
<ref>
TODO: [https://phabricator.whonix.org/T71 Show desktop clock in local time; keep system in UTC]
</ref>) is more than 1 hour in the past or more than 3 hours in the future, Tor can't connect. In this case, manually fix the host clock by right-clicking on it. Also check for an empty battery. Then, power off and power on the Whonix-Gateway and Tor should be able to reconnect. If the host clock is grossly inaccurate, the user might experience problems when updating the host operating system, so periodically check it is (roughly) correct.

This chapter is intended to be a short and simple overview to provide basic protection. The user can achieve greater security by following the recommendations in the [[Advanced_Security_Guide#Network_Time_Synchronization | Network Time Synchronization]] chapter from the Advanced Security Guide.
