== Increase Virtual Machine RAM ==

}}

* {{workstation_product_name}}: No changes are required for most users.
* {{gateway_product_name}}: If you have enough RAM on the host, ideally the virtual RAM setting of {{gateway_product_name}} should be increased to <code>2048</code> MB RAM. <ref>
This provides higher performance during upgrades and lowers the likelihood of [https://forums.whonix.org/t/swap-swap-file-whonix-gateway-freezing-during-apt-get-dist-upgrade-encrypted-swap-file-creator/8317 issues].
</ref>
** If it is infeasible to increase the virtual RAM setting, this is okay too. <ref>
Although non-ideal, [https://github.com/Whonix/swap-file-creator swap-file-creator] will create an encrypted swap file and the [https://forums.whonix.org/t/vm-swappiness-1-set-swapiness-to-lowest-setting-still-useful-swappiness-lowest/9278 system is configured to swap as little as possible].
</ref>

If it is unknown how much RAM is available, follow these steps on the host: <ref>https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/66809-determine-system-memory-size-speed-type-windows-10-a.html</ref> <ref>https://vitux.com/how-to-check-installed-ram-on-debian/</ref> <ref>https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201191</ref>

== Change Keyboard Layout ==
{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt={{project_name}}Change Keyboard Layout info box]]
| text    = [[Qubes|{{q_project_name}}]] users can skip this section. <ref>
By default, Qubes VMs use the same keyboard layout as Qubes dom0.
</ref>
}}

If you are using a keyboard layout other than <code>qwerty</code> (US), you might want to change your keyboard layout. Refer to the dedicated [[Keyboard Layout]] article on how to do that.

== Test Keyboard Layout ==
{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt={{project_name}}Test Keyboard Layout info box]]
| text    = [[Qubes|{{q_project_name}}]] users can skip this section.
</ref>
}}

<code>Start menu</code> &rarr; <code>Accessories</code> &rarr; <code>Mousepad</code>

Or...

{{Open File
|filename=~/testfile
}}

Try typing the words <code>user</code>, <code>changeme</code> and <code>qwerty</code>. Trying typing some more to make sure you are using the desired keyboard layout.

== Change Passwords ==
{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt={{project_name}} default password info box]]
| text    = [[Qubes|{{q_project_name}}]] users can skip this section. <ref>
By default, Qubes does not require a password for superuser access.
</ref> <ref>
https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/vm-sudo/
</ref>
}}

<div class>
After {{project name}} has finished installing, immediately change the passwords for both the user <code>user</code> and user <code>root</code> accounts.

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Make sure you did [[#Change Keyboard Layout|Change Keyboard Layout]] and [[#Test Keyboard Layout|Test Keyboard Layout]] before you proceed. Otherwise you might run into issues proceeding further.

'''2.''' Open a terminal (such as Xfce Terminal Emulator).

<code>Start menu</code> &rarr; <code>Applications</code> &rarr; <code>System</code> &rarr; <code>Terminal</code>

'''3.''' Run a test command as <code>root</code> by using <code>sudo</code>.

Run. <ref name=pwd_change>Type the command in the terminal and press <code><Enter></code>.</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemd-detect-virt
}}

'''4.''' Read the note below regarding the username and password.
{{Default_Passwords}}

When typing the password it will <u>not</u> appear on the screen, nor will the asterisk sign (<code>*</code>) be visible. It is necessary to type blindly and trust the procedure.

'''5.''' Change the root password.

To change the <code>root</code> (superuser / administrator) password, run. <ref name=pwd_change />

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo passwd root
}}

And follow the instructions.

'''6.''' Change the user password.

To change the <code>user</code> ({{project name}} default user) password, run. <ref name=pwd_change />

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo passwd user
}}

'''7.''' Done.

The procedure of changing passwords is complete.
}}
</div>

When having issues gaining root consider using [[Root#dsudo_-_default_password_sudo|dsudo]].

Another option is to [[Recovery#Recovery_Mode|boot into recovery mode]] and change passwords there.

== Security Updates ==

Regularly check for security updates and apply them in a timely fashion; see [[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates#Updates|Operating System Updates]].

= Network Time Syncing =
This is a short summary of the [[Network Time Synchronization]] wiki page which is recommended reading.

'''1.''' Timezone information.

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text    = '''Warning:''' The system clock inside {{project name}} is set to UTC to prevent against [[timezone]] leaks. This means it may be a few hours ahead or behind the user's host system clock. <u>It is strongly recommended not to change this setting.</u>
}}

'''2.''' reasonably accurate host clock required

A reasonably accurate host clock is required for many general security properties because an inaccurate clock can lead to

* '''A)''' Broken internet connectivity, and
* '''B)''' [[Time Attacks]].

Therefore, at all times it is recommended to have a host clock with accuracy of up to Â± 30 minutes.

'''3.''' pause / suspend / save / hibernate

Simplified, for most users, for most VMs it is strongly discouraged to use the pause / suspend / save / hibernate features. For details, in what situation this is possible see [[Network Time Synchronization]].

= Better Security =

This chapter is aimed at newcomers and only provides a short and simple overview for basic protection. Anonymity and platform security can be improved by following recommendations outlined in the Security Guide and Advanced Security Guide sections, along with the [[Time Attacks]] and [[Network_Time_Synchronization|Network Time Synchronization]] page.

See <code>/etc/whonix_version</code>.

==== {{gateway_product_name}} ====
