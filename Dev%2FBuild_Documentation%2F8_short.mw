== Introduction ==
This page documents how to build Whonix VirtualBox images.

It documents how to build the '''testers-only''' of Whonix (version 7.7.8.7 is used in the examples below). 


Build prerequisites:

- working internet connection.

- system with Debian Stable (Wheezy) installed

- 25GB of free disk space


The focus here is to show the simplest way to build Whonix from source. Various security precautions such as GPG key verification are omitted.

Please read the [[Dev/Build_Documentation|full build documentation]] in order to understand the process better.

== Preparing the system for build ==

<pre>
## (host) login with "root"
root

## Add a new repository source if not already present
echo "deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ wheezy main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list

## Refresh package lists and upgrade
apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade -y

## Install "sudo" and git if not already installed
apt-get install sudo git -y

## Add "user" to "sudo" group
addgroup user sudo

## Reboot the system to apply the changes
shutdown -r now
</pre>


== Building from source ==

<pre>
## (host) login with "user"
user

#Get source code.
git clone https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix

## Go into the git directory
cd Whonix

## Get a list of available git tags.
git tag

## Choose which version you want to build.
git checkout 7.7.8.7
</pre>


== VM Creation ==

Build a Whonix-Gateway virtual machine image.

<pre>
sudo ./whonix_build --build --tor-gateway 
</pre>


Build a Whonix-Workstation virtual machine image.

<pre>
sudo ./whonix_build --build --tor-workstation
</pre>

The resulting {{Code2|.ova}} images can be found in {{Code|~/whonix_binary}} folder.


If you want to create a log of the build process (very useful for debugging) use the following commands but be aware that all output will be redirected to a file, meaning nothing will appear on the screen. This will create a text log in /home/user/log. 


For Workstation

<pre>
sudo ./nothing-to-see/whonix_build --build --tor-workstation >> /home/user/log-workstation 2>> /home/user/log-workstation
</pre>

For Gateway

<pre>
sudo ./nothing-to-see/whonix_build --build --tor-gateway >> /home/user/log-gateway 2>> /home/user/log-gateway
</pre>

== Finish == 

After a few hours (depending on your disk speed, CPU clock rate, available download bandwidth, ...) the image (either Workstation or Gateway) will be created in {{Code|~/whonix_binary}} directory. This will take from 3 to 7 hours per image.

OVA image can now be used in VirtualBox.
