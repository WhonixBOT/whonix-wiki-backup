= Dummy Tor =
{{Stable}}

Whonix-Workstation has an empty Tor package installed by default, called Dummy Tor package. It contains no files, besides some default files <ref>changelog.gz copyright README.Debian control control.tar.gz data.tar.gz debian-binary md5sums</ref>, which are required to create a dummy package. Debian packages are standard Unix '''ar''' archives, auditors can unpack and check them.

The reason for installing the Dummy Tor package inside Whonix-Workstation is to prevent installing the Tor package from the upstream (Debian or The Tor Project) repository, to prevent running Tor over Tor. This allows installation of packages, which depend on Tor, such as TorChat and parcimonie on Whonix-Workstation.

To prevent the package from upgrading (up to Whonix 0.5.6 only)

<pre>echo "tor hold" | sudo dpkg --set-selections</pre>

has been run while building Whonix from source code.

To check the status an auditor could run.

<pre>dpkg --get-selections | grep tor</pre>

To undo holding the packing a user could run.

<pre>echo "tor install" | sudo dpkg --set-selections</pre>

= Implementation =
{{Stable}}

* Everything is inside the ''whonix_workstation/usr/local/share/whonix/dummytor/'' folder in Whonix source code
* and subsequently in /usr/local/share/whonix/dummytor/ in Whoix-Workstation.
* .deb package format
* /usr/local/share/whonix/dummytor/tor is the control file
* /usr/local/share/whonix/dummytor/tor_1.0_all.deb is the package which was installed using dpkg by whonix_workstation/usr/local/share/whonix_internal_install_script.
* whonix_workstation/usr/local/share/whonix/dummytor/dummytor is the "build script" for the package, which is actually only a single "equivs-build ./tor" command.
