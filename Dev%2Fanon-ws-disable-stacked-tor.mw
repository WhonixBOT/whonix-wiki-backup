See [[DoNot#Prevent_Tor_over_Tor_scenarios.]]

= Implementation =
Implemented in three ways on Whonix-Workstation.

* Implemented in Whonix source folder, {{Code|debian/control}}. The dummytor package uses the "Provides: tor" field<ref>See "7.5 Virtual packages - Provides" on http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html</ref>, which should avoid any kinds of conflicts, in case upstream releases a higher version of Tor. This won't work for packages, which depend on an explicit version of Tor (such as TorChat).

* Tor autostart is disabled in {{Code|/etc/default/tor}}, so even if the {{Code|tor}} package gets installed, it won't be automatically started.

* rinetd listens on Tor's default ports. system Tor's {{Code|127.0.0.1:9050}}, {{Code|127.0.0.1:9051}} and TBB's {{Code|127.0.0.1:9150}}, {{Code|127.0.0.1:9051}}, which prevents the default Tor Browser Bundle or Tor package from The Tor Project to open listening ports on these ports, which will result in their Tor failing to open the listening port and therefore exiting, thus preventing Tor over Tor.
