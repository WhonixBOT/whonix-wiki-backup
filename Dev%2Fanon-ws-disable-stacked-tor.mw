See [[DoNot#Prevent_Tor_over_Tor_scenarios.]]

= Implementation =
Implemented in three ways on Whonix-Workstation.

* Implemented in [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor], [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor/blob/master/debian/control {{Code|debian/control}}]. The package uses the "Provides: tor" field<ref>See "7.5 Virtual packages - Provides" on http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html</ref>, which should avoid any kinds of conflicts, in case upstream releases a higher version of Tor. This won't work for packages, which depend on an explicit version of Tor (such as TorChat). This is non-ideal, since for example the {{Code|torchat}} package will install Tor, but still acceptable, because of the following additional implementations.

* Tor's autostart is disabled in {{Code|/etc/default/tor}} (dpkg-diverted using config-package-dev), so even if the {{Code|tor}} package gets installed, it won't be automatically started.

* {{Code|rinetd}} is configured by [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor/blob/master/etc/rinetd.conf.anondist {{Code|/etc/rinetd.conf}}] to listen on
** Tor's default ports. I.e.
*** system Tor's {{Code|127.0.0.1:9050}}, {{Code|127.0.0.1:9051}} and,
*** TBB's {{Code|127.0.0.1:9150}}, {{Code|127.0.0.1:9051}}
*** Tor Messenger's {{Code|127.0.0.1:9152}}, {{Code|127.0.0.1:9153}}
** Those are forwarded to Whonix-Gateway.
** This prevents the default Tor Browser Bundle, Tor Messenger and/or Tor package by The Tor Project from opening these default ports, which will result in Tor failing to open its listening port and therefore exiting, thus preventing Tor over Tor.
