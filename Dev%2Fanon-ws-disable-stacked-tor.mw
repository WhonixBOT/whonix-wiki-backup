= Implementation =
TODO: needs update (moved to socat with Whonix 13 <code>anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor</code> <code>3:2.4-1</code> stable upgrade)

Implemented in three ways on Whonix-Workstation.

* Implemented in [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor], [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor/blob/master/debian/control {{Code|debian/control}}]. The package uses the "Provides: tor" field<ref>See "7.5 Virtual packages - Provides" on http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html</ref>, which should avoid any kinds of conflicts, in case upstream releases a higher version of Tor. This won't work for packages, which depend on an explicit version of Tor (such as TorChat). This is non-ideal, since for example the {{Code|torchat}} package will install Tor, but still acceptable, because of the following additional implementations.

* Tor's autostart is disabled in {{Code|/etc/default/tor}} (dpkg-diverted using config-package-dev), so even if the {{Code|tor}} package gets installed, it won't be automatically started.

* {{Code|rinetd}} is configured by [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor/blob/master/etc/rinetd.conf.anondist {{Code|/etc/rinetd.conf}}] to listen on
** Tor's default ports. I.e.
*** system Tor's {{Code|127.0.0.1:9050}}, {{Code|127.0.0.1:9051}} and,
*** Tor Browser's {{Code|127.0.0.1:9150}}, {{Code|127.0.0.1:9051}}
*** Tor Messenger's {{Code|127.0.0.1:9152}}, {{Code|127.0.0.1:9153}}
** Those are forwarded to Whonix-Gateway.
** This prevents the default Tor Browser, Tor Messenger and/or Tor package by The Tor Project from opening these default ports, which will result in Tor failing to open its listening port and therefore exiting, thus preventing Tor over Tor.

We mimic a functional Tor as good as possible.

anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor is also providing:

* Tor Control Unix Domain Socket file: /var/run/tor/control, which is redirected to Control Port Filter Proxy on Whonix-Gateway.
* Tor Control Auth Cookie: a functional /var/run/tor/control.authcookie that works with [[Dev/Control_Port_Filter_Proxy|Control Port Filter Proxy]].
* Tor Socks Unix Domain Socket file: /var/run/tor/socks that is redirected to Whonix-Gateway Tor port 9050

It appears you have configured your web browser to use Tor as an HTTP proxy.
This is not correct: Tor is a SOCKS proxy, not an HTTP proxy.
Please configure your client accordingly.
