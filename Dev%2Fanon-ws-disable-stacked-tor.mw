See [[DoNot#Prevent_Tor_over_Tor_scenarios.]]

= Implementation =
TODO:

* needs update (moved to socat with Whonix 13 <code>anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor</code> <code>3:2.4-1</code> stable upgrade)
* needs update (moved to systemd-socket-proxyd with Whonix 14)

Implemented in three ways on Whonix-Workstation.

* Implemented in [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor], [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor/blob/master/debian/control {{Code|debian/control}}]. The package uses the "Provides: tor" field<ref>See "7.5 Virtual packages - Provides" on http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html</ref>, which should avoid any kinds of conflicts, in case upstream releases a higher version of Tor. This won't work for packages, which depend on an explicit version of Tor (such as TorChat). This is non-ideal, since for example the {{Code|torchat}} package will install Tor, but still acceptable, because of the following additional implementations.

* Tor's autostart is disabled in {{Code|/etc/default/tor}} (dpkg-diverted using config-package-dev), so even if the {{Code|tor}} package gets installed, it won't be automatically started.

* {{Code|rinetd}} is configured by [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor/blob/master/etc/rinetd.conf.anondist {{Code|/etc/rinetd.conf}}] to listen on
** Tor's default ports. I.e.
*** system Tor's {{Code|127.0.0.1:9050}}, {{Code|127.0.0.1:9051}} and,
*** Tor Browser's {{Code|127.0.0.1:9150}}, {{Code|127.0.0.1:9051}}
*** Tor Messenger's {{Code|127.0.0.1:9152}}, {{Code|127.0.0.1:9153}}
** Those are forwarded to Whonix-Gateway.
** This prevents the default Tor Browser, Tor Messenger and/or Tor package by The Tor Project from opening these default ports, which will result in Tor failing to open its listening port and therefore exiting, thus preventing Tor over Tor.

We mimic a functional Tor as well as possible.

anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor is also providing:

* Tor Control Unix Domain Socket file: /var/run/tor/control, which is redirected to Control Port Filter Proxy on Whonix-Gateway.
* Tor Control Auth Cookie: a functional /var/run/tor/control.authcookie that works with [[Dev/Control_Port_Filter_Proxy|Control Port Filter Proxy]].
* Tor Socks Unix Domain Socket file: /var/run/tor/socks that is redirected to Whonix-Gateway Tor port 9050

It appears you have configured your web browser to use Tor as an HTTP proxy.
This is not correct: Tor is a SOCKS proxy, not an HTTP proxy.
Please configure your client accordingly.

Debugging with curl

Trying to use curl rather than curl.anondist-org is a common mistake when debugging Whonix network issues.

curl is a symlink to curl.anondist. In turn, this symlinks to uwt which runs curl under torsocks. torksocks then forces Tor to run on localhost for stream isolation.

To use curl

* The uwt steam isolation wrapper must be deactivated
* The command must be run under user clearnet
        
In Whonix-Gateway or sys-whonix (Qube-Whonix)
  
1. Change to user clearnet

sudo su clearnet

2. Deactivate uwt stream isolation wrapper by appending .anondist-orig to curl

curl.anondist-orig <your_url>

Using curl in Whonix 14
 
In the following examples, the exec calls from the command output shows the difference between running curl with the uwtwrapper both enabled and disabled. 

Example 1

curl is run with the uwtwrapper enabled. 

uwtwrapper_verbose=1 curl <your_url>

This results in the following exec calls. Only the latest (most recent) call matters which shows torsocks is prepended before running curl. 

exec torsocks /usr/lib/uwtexec something <your_url>
exec -a /usr/bin/curl /usr/bin/curl.anondist-orig <your_url>

Example 2

curl is run with the uwtwrapper disabled.

uwtwrapper_verbose=1 UWT_DEV_PASSTHROUGH=1 curl <your_url>

This command results in the following exec calls which show torsocks does not get prepended before curl. Since curl does not run under torsocks, local connections are not hindered and there is no stream isolation

exec /usr/lib/uwtexec <your_url>
exec -a /usr/bin/curl /usr/bin/curl.anondist-orig <your_url>

The output from the previous commands establish the following

/usr/bin/curl is symbolically linked to /usr/bin/curl.anondist-orig. This demonstrates /usr/bin/curl.anondist-orig is the actual (real) curl binary.

When /usr/bin/curl.anondist-orig is run with the uwtwrapper disabled all uwt logic is circumvented. 

Users can either run curl under user clearnet  or deactivate the uwt stream isolation
wrapper either permanently or temporary
