= Implementation =
Implemented in three ways on Whonix-Workstation.

* Implemented in Whonix source folder, {{Code|debian/control}}. The dummytor package uses the "Provides: tor" field<ref>See "7.5 Virtual packages - Provides" on http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html</ref>, which should avoid any kinds of conflicts, in case upstream releases a higher version of Tor. This won't work for packages, which depend on an explicit version of Tor (such as TorChat). This is non-ideal, since for example the {{Code|torchat}} package will install Tor, but still acceptable, because of the following additional implementations.

* Tor's autostart is disabled in {{Code|/etc/default/tor}} (dpkg-diverted using config-package-dev), so even if the {{Code|tor}} package gets installed, it won't be automatically started.

* {{Code|rinetd}} listens on Tor's default ports. system Tor's {{Code|127.0.0.1:9050}}, {{Code|127.0.0.1:9051}} and TBB's {{Code|127.0.0.1:9150}}, {{Code|127.0.0.1:9051}}, which prevents the default Tor Browser Bundle or Tor package by The Tor Project from opening these default ports, which will result in Tor failing to open its listening port and therefore exiting, thus preventing Tor over Tor.
