= Dummy Tor =
Three implementations. Only on Whonix-Workstation.

# Implemented in Whonix source folder, {{Code|debian/control}}. The dummytor package uses the "Provides: tor" field<ref>See "7.5 Virtual packages - Provides" on http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html</ref>, which should avoid any kinds of conflicts, in case upstream releases a higher version.

# Tor autostart is disabled in {{Code|/etc/default/tor}}, so even if the package gets installed, it won't be automatically started.

# rinetd listens on Tor's default ports. system Tor's {{Code|127.0.0.1:9050}}, {{Code|127.0.0.1:9051}} and TBB's {{Code|127.0.0.1:9150}}, {{Code|127.0.0.1:9051}}.
