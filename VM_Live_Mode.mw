[[File:Live_boot_cropped_more.png||thumb|{{project_name}} Live Mode boot option in boot menu. ([[#Images|more screenshots]])]]

Users can optionally run [[Main Page|{{project_name}}]] as a live system. '''{{free}}'''

This is only available in [[{{non q project name short}}|{{non q project name}}]].

The primary objective is preventing [[malware|malware]] from gaining persistence and having an unchanged system after each reboot. This is also useful for improved HDD/SSD privacy as well as experimental changes like testing software.

__TOC__

= Introduction =

Booting into live mode will ensure all disk writes to the virtual hard drive are forgotten after shutdown because all writes go to volatile memory (RAM) instead of the hard disk. In other words, after shutdown everything that happened during a previous boot session will not be visible (persist) on the virtual hard drive, including:
* everything that is created / changed / downloaded in the virtual machine (VM);
* any websites visited, files downloaded or documents created; and
* any other modifications of the virtual hard drive or activity history. 

This also holds true for malicious changes made by [[malware]], except when:

* [[Whonix_Live/Read_Only_Mode_Hard_Drive|read-only hard drive mode]] is <u>not</u> configured and malware remounted the disk as read-write or broke out of the VM; or
* [[Whonix_Live/Read_Only_Mode_Hard_Drive|read-only hard drive mode]] is configured and malware broke out of the VM. <ref>
There are two live mode options available, [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/grub-live <code>grub-live</code>] and [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/ro-mode-init <code>ro-mode-init</code>].

* <code>grub-live</code>: a new boot menu entry is created which must be selected manually, but it is a better failsafe and hence the recommended option.
* <code>ro-mode-init</code>: the boot menu stays the same and the system automatically boots into live mode when it detects a read-only disk, otherwise it boots normally into persistent mode. The advantage of using this approach is that malware running in a VM cannot silently change settings to leave persistent traces.

! scope="row"| Forensics
| By itself, starting a VM in live mode is not amnesic. Many users are unaware that activities performed inside the VM might be stored on the host HDD/SSD in locations that are hard to review (for the majority). Extra steps must be performed on the host operating system to minimize these traces -- see [[Anti-Forensics Precautions]].
|-
! scope="row"| Malware
| To prevent malware from remounting the hard drive as read-write it is strongly recommended to use [[Whonix_Live/Read_Only_Mode_Hard_Drive|read-only hard drive mode]]. This raises the bar as malware would need to break out of the VM to gain persistence.
|-
! scope="row"| Other Precautions
| 
* <u>{{workstation_product_name}} and {{gateway_product_name}}</u>: It is recommended to regularly boot into persistent mode for installation of [[Update|updates]]. <br />
* <u>{{gateway_product_name}}</u>: If live mode is used with {{gateway_product_name}}, regularly booting into persistent mode is important to keep Tor's normal [[Tor_Entry_Guards|guard]] rotation schedule. <br />
* <u>KVM</u>: Hard shutdowns of a VM can prevent loading of the filesystem with a read-only marked drive on next boot. Do not use 'Force Off/Reset' on KVM to avoid this possibility.

= grub-live on {{gateway_product_name}} =
The first start of {{gateway_product_name}} should not use live mode. This will allow [[Tor]] to make use of [[Tor Entry Guards]].

From the second start of {{gateway_product_name}} it is recommended to run it in live mode. This should eliminate any Tor-related, cached data like DNS requests that could leave traces about web activity. However be warned that it may make your Tor behavior distinguishable from regular Tor users:

* <u>Consensus files</u>: These files will be (re-)downloaded more frequently.
* <u>Tor guards</u>: When switching to a new guard after some months have passed. <ref>

sudo lsblk --all

Example <code>lsblk</code> with <code>snapd</code> and <code>WickrMe</code> installed, {{Workstation product name}}, [[Whonix_Live/Read_Only_Mode_Hard_Drive|read-only hard drive mode]] disabled.

* The meaning of <code>0</code> in <code>lsblk</code> output is <code>read-write.</code>.
* The meaning of <code>1</code> in <code>lsblk</code> output is <code>read-only.</code>.

If anything in coloumn <code>RO</code> is set to <code>0</code>, then it's not blessed [[Whonix_Live/Read_Only_Mode_Hard_Drive|read-only hard drive mode]].
