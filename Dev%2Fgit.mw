== Introduction ==

While the project is small adrelanos thinks it is best not to make a too difficult policy.

== master ==

* <s>Adrelanos's progress of work.</s>
* Not calling it unstable, because the changes will most likely never make it unstable but it is just not tested if it still builds.
* Branching model, project readme, information, gpg...

== stable ==

* last released and recommended {{project name}} version
* ready to include hotfixes

== development ==

* does currently not exist, since only one adding code
* candidate for next {{project name}} version
* <s>must always build</s>
* currently restructuring
* we can make an always building development branch as soon as someone else commits code

== untested_adre ==

== untested_yourname ==

== perhaps 0.5.x etc. as release branches ==

== feature branches when it makes sense ==

== signed git tags ==

Releases will be tagged and gpg signed.

== temporary git tags ==

Will be named like: adretemp1 or 96adretemp

Can get deleted from time to time.

== Link to Source Code ==

https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/{{project_name_short}}

= subscribe to code changes =
== git ==
Git clone [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/{{project_name_short}} github].

A git specific work flow could be:

<pre>git fetch</pre>

every (few) day(s) and then git diff(tool), merge, etc.

== rss feed notification ==
https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/{{project_name_short}}/commits/master.atom

== manually in your browser ==
Check every now and then https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/{{project_name_short}}/commits/master.

== Github Commits Mailing List ==
[https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/whonix-commits Whonix-commits read only mailing list]

(Stay hosted on sourceforge.net. Barely anyone is signed up and it is quite high traffic.)

== Twitter ==
If you prefer Twitter, use the [https://twitter.com/{{project_name_short}}Source Secondary Twitter Account for Source Code Commit Notification].

= grep {{project name}} source code =
{{Build Documentation Get Source Code}}

== Setup ==
{{Update}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}

Install <code>git</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install git
}}

Unless you want to use git for pushing changes to remotes which you probably won't in a testing VM you can use the following git config without using any real names or pseudonyms. (These are the git suggested defaults. <ref>
<pre>
git commit -a -m .

*** Please tell me who you are.

Run

  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"

to set your account's default identity.
Omit --global to set the identity only in this repository.

fatal: empty ident name (for <(null)>) not allowed
</pre>
</ref>)

{{CodeSelect|code=
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
}}

== Enable Git Version Control for Folder ==
Go to the folder you want to set under git version control.

{{CodeSelect|code=
cd ~
}}

Initialize git version control.

{{CodeSelect|code=
git init
}}

Add all files to git version control.

{{CodeSelect|code=
git add -A
}}

Commit all files to git. <ref>
Without any useful commit message. <code>.</code> is the commit message here.
</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
git commit -a -m .
}}

Do changes such as changing KDE settings.

See what changed.

{{CodeSelect|code=
git diff
}}

Optional. Just sharing. Like it or not.

* Bash completion can complete git commands and branch names.
