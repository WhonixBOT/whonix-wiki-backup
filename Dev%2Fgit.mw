While the project is small adrelanos thinks it is best not to make a too difficult policy.

== master ==

* <s>Adrelanos's progress of work.</s>
* Not calling it unstable, because the changes will most likely never make it unstable but it is just not tested if it still builds.
* Branching model, project readme, information, gpg...

== stable ==

* last released and recommended Whonix version
* ready to include hotfixes

== development ==

* does currently not exist, since only one adding code
* candidate for next Whonix version
* <s>must always build</s>
* currently restructuring
* we can make an always building development branch as soon as someone else commits code
