== Introduction ==

While the project is small adrelanos thinks it's best not to make a too difficult policy.

== master ==

* <s>Adrelanos's progress of work.</s>
* Not calling it unstable, because the changes will most likely never make it unstable but it's just not tested if it still builds.
* Branching model, project readme, information, gpg...

== stable ==

* last released and recommended Whonix version
* ready to include hotfixes

== development ==

* does currently not exist, since only one adding code
* candidate for next Whonix version
* <s>must always build</s>
* currently restructuring
* we can make an always building development branch as soon as someone else commits code

== untested_adre ==

== untested_yourname ==

== perhaps 0.5.x etc. as release branches ==

== feature branches when it makes sense ==

== signed git tags ==

Releases will be tagged and gpg signed.

== git ==

Adrelanos always pushes code to [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix github]. Sometimes also to [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/code/ sf.net].

A git specific work flow could be:

<pre>git fetch</pre>

every (few) day(s) and then git diff(tool), merge, etc.

== Github Commits Mailing List ==

[https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/whonix-commits Whonix-commits read only mailing list]

If you prefer Twitter, use the [https://twitter.com/WhonixSource Secondary Twitter Account for Source Code Commit Notification].

== Feed notification ==

Feed notification: There is on [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/code/ sf.net] git is a [rss] subscribe button: '''F'''.

If you are actually using it, please tell adrelanos, so the sf repository gets updated more often.
