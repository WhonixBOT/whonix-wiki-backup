== Introduction ==
You can either host your own anonymous services (web sites etc.) at home (using Tor [[Onion Services]], at servers you physically own or you can use (free) services (free .onion web space, VPS servers, web space, etc.) provided by third parties.

If you are only interested in Tor onion services, move on to [[Onion Services]]. This page discusses and compares different kinds of Location/IP Hidden Servers.

There are three different ways to run location hidden servers. Tor Onion Services, pagekite. .onion webspace, and Anonymous Third Party Hosts. Below is an overview.

If you don't know which one to use, probably Tor Onion Services are most easy and most anonymous. Below is also a conclusion and a comparison table.

== Tor Onion Services ==

* censor resistant, no one can take the .onion domain offline <ref>Besides compromising of the host and / or flood attack.</ref>
* additionally accessible over tor2web over http <ref>Which doesn't offer as much censor resistance as the .onion domain does</ref>
* they are completely free
* no sign up required
* and don't require any additional software besides of course the server software you want to anonymize.
* Can be run at home; on any server you physically own; or on (anonymous) third party hosts.
* Has its own wiki page, see [[Onion Services]].

== VPN with Remote Port Forwarding ==

* censor resistance depends on the VPN provider
* reachable by clients, who do not have to use Tor
* there are probably no free VPN services providing [http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/16627/does-portforwarding-present-a-risk-to-anonymity Remote Port Forwarding]
* probably sign up required
* can be run at home, on any server you physically own, or on (anonymous) third party hosts

== pagekite ==

* alternative service called [https://pagekite.net/ pagekite]
* must comply with [https://pagekite.net/humans.txt pagekite terms of service]
* requires registration and an (anonymous) [[E-Mail]] address
* free for Free Software authors; can apply for a free account; or subscription based service
* known to work inside Whonix-Workstation out of the box
* less tested by {{project name}} developers
* there is no documentation besides this chapter, however, usage is simple and their service is well documented. See [https://pagekite.net/wiki/Howto/PageKiteOverTor/ Running PageKite over Tor].
** Instead of localhost you could use the Whonix-Gateway IP 10.152.152.10 and a custom port such as 9159, i.e. replace "''--torify=localhost:9050''" with "''--torify=10.152.152.10:9159''".
** Or you could drop the "''--torify''" switch at all and even follow the default pagekite GNU/Linux tutorial, because ''misc traffic'' in Whonix-Workstation gets automatically routed through Tor's TransPort.
** See [[Stream Isolation]] for an explanation of ''misc traffic'', custom Socks Ports and Tor's TransPort in Whonix.

== Anonymous Third Party Hosts ==
There are many so called offshore or anonymous hosting companies. Most of those hosting companies do not really offer anonymity. Most require valid registration data (real name etc.), forbid registration over Tor and/or do not offer anonymous payment methods.

The ones listed in the following list are Tor user friendly, accept anonymous registration and can be paid anonymously by BTC or prepaid cards. ([https://forums.whonix.org/t/abolishing-third-party-hosting-services-in-wiki List deprecated.])

* There are some free .onion web hosting services. Also paid ones.
* There are also anonymous VPS servers, although no free ones, which would require [[Money|anonymous money]].

== Conclusion ==

Each way to run location hidden servers has its own advantages and disadvantages.

With Tor Onion Services, you don't have to learn and obtain anonymous money, which is difficult on its own. You have to trust no one, but your own skills setting up a server. No one can censor the server, there is no signup, no terms of service. Disadvantage is, if someone compromises your onion service either by an successful attack against Tor onion services are by an successful attack against your server software and breaking out of Whonix, it is game over. It is only accessible over .onion (visitors need Tor) and tor2web does not get indexed by search engines. Tor Onion Services are only online as long as your server is online.

A free (or paid) .onion web space host can steal your domain any time and take it over. You don't have to worry about server security and successful attacks against the Tor onion services won't lead to your location or IP address.

Anonymous Third Party Hosts for VPS hosting involve anonymous money, which is difficult on its own. They can provide clearnet domains and/or you can use them to host Tor onion services. You don't have to worry about server security and successful attacks against Tor onion services won't lead to your location or IP address.
