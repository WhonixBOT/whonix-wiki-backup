= Hosting Location/IP Hidden Servers =

== Introduction ==

If you are only interested in Tor hidden services, move on to [[Hidden Services]]. This page discusses and compares different kinds of Location/IP Hidden Servers.

There are three different ways to run location hidden servers. Tor Hidden Services, pagekite. .onion webspace and Anonymous Third Party Hosts. Below is an overview.

If you don't know which one to use, probably Tor Hidden Services are most easy and most anonymous. Below is also a conclusion and a comparison table.

== Tor Hidden Services ==

* censor resistant, no one can take the .onion domain offline <ref>Besides compromising of the host and / or flood attack.</ref>
* additionally accessible over tor2web over http <ref>Which doesn't offer as much censor resistance as the .onion domain does</ref>
* they are completely free
* no sign up required
* and don't require any additional software besides of course the server software you want to anonymize.
* Can be run at home; on any server you physically own; or on (anonymous) third party hosts.
* Has it's own wiki page, see [[Hidden Services]]. 

== pagekite ==

* alternative service called [https://pagekite.net/ pagekite]
* must comply with [https://pagekite.net/humans.txt pagekite terms of service]
* requires registration and an (anonymous) [[E-Mail]] address
* free for Free Software authors; can apply for a free account; or subscription based service
* known to work inside Whonix-Workstation out of the box
* less tested by Whonix developers
* there is no documentation besides this chapter, however, usage is simple and their service is well documented. See [https://pagekite.net/wiki/Howto/PageKiteOverTor/ Running PageKite over Tor].
** Instead of localhost you could use the Whonix-Gateway IP 192.168.0.10 and a custom port such as 9159, i.e. replace &quot;''--torify=localhost:9050''&quot; with &quot;''--torify=192.168.0.10:9159''&quot;.
** Or you could drop the &quot;''--torify''&quot; switch at all and even follow the default pagekite GNU/Linux tutorial, because ''misc traffic'' in Whonix-Workstation gets automatically routed through Tor's TransPort.
** See [[Stream Isolation]] for an explanation of ''misc traffic'', custom Socks Ports and Tor's TransPort in Whonix.

== Anonymous Third Party Hosts ==

* Has it's own wiki page, see [[Hosting]].
* There are some free .onion web hosting services. Also paid ones.
* There are also anonymous VPS servers, although no free ones, which would require [[Money|anonymous money]].

== Conclusion ==

Each way to run location hidden servers has it's own advantages and disadvantages.

With Tor Hidden Services, you don't have to learn and obtain anonymous money, which is difficult on it's own. You have to trust no one, but your own skills setting up a server. No one can censor the server, there is no signup, no terms of service. Disadvantage is, if someone compromises your hidden service either by an successful attack against Tor hidden services are by an successful attack against your server software and breaking out of Whonix, it's game over. It's only accessible over .onion (visitors need Tor) and tor2web does not get indexed by search engines. Tor Hidden Services are only online as long as your server is online.

A free (or paid) .onion web space host can steal your domain any time and take it over. You don't have to worry about server security and successful attacks against the Tor hidden services won't lead to your location or IP address.

Anonymous Third Party Hosts for VPS hosting involve anonymous money, which is difficult on it's own. They can provide clearnet domains and/or you can use them to host Tor hidden services. You don't have to worry about server security and successful attacks against Tor hidden services won't lead to your location or IP address.
