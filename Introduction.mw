| text    = Anonymity is not a program, setup, or final destination -- it is actually a continual process, influenced by new knowledge that is constantly gathered. <ref>This aligns with the axiom that [[Basic_Security_Guide_Introduction|"Security is a process, not a product."]]</ref>
}}

Using {{project name}} with its default settings provides more security than Tor alone. Anonymity is a complex problem and there is no easy solution to the many complicated challenges that all users face. The more you know, the safer and more anonymous you can be. {{project name}} provides extensive [[Documentation|documentation]] for those interested in learning more.

The goal of this documentation is to describe The {{project name}} Anonymous Operating System in an easy-to-understand and reasonably thorough manner. It is hoped readers will be exposed to a range of new and improved concepts/applications regarding anonymity and security on the Internet.

Note that all the applications included in {{project name}} are <u>not</u> fully documented. Usually an overview is provided, with further details on {{project_name}}-specific configurations that might be necessary. In general, use the documentation as a reference guide for only those features you intend to use. For instance, if a user is interested in I2P over Tor, the introductory section on [[Other_Anonymizing_Networks|Other Anonymizing Networks]] should be read first, followed by the [[I2P]] chapter.

= {{project_name}} Footnotes and References =

<font size="-3">Small text</font> and footnotes like <sup>1</sup> are not that crucial. They contain clarifications, information sources, extra notes for people with higher security needs, additional details to dispel doubts (in the case of controversial issues), proof of something, references, links, and so on. Generally speaking, it is unnecessary to read all of the footnote links (particularly for beginners), but it is encouraged.

For further clarification, footnotes are typically used in the following circumstances:
* <u>Developer notepad</u>: Sometimes links are added when references such as related source code are difficult to find (on search engines or otherwise).
* <u>Supporting evidence</u>: Footnotes often provide additional references to support statements in the main documentation, particularly if factual statements are not obvious. This preempts possible future questions from the {{project_name}} population and provides greater clarification at the outset.
* <u>Comments for auditors</u>: In various sections footnotes are added to answer potential auditor questions around specific {{project_name}} recommendations, chosen security configurations, why alternatives were not implemented, and so on.
* <u>Reducing duplication</u>: To avoid duplicate tickets and discussions, footnotes often link to existing (usability) issues, as well as identical or related discussions to raise the reader's awareness.
* <u>Reducing confusion</u>: Footnotes will sometimes link to additional information sources in an effort to  reduce user confusion. For example, a common use case is when a major {{project_name}} configuration has changed; legacy users might be confused why a change was implemented if this issue was not referenced. In general this reduces the likelihood of support requests.
* <u>Troubleshooting</u>: Most software is expected to be fully functional with available instructions. However, in corner cases footnotes can provide possible troubleshooting tips and known workarounds.
* <u>Advanced users</u>: To be more user-friendly, documentation is generally focused on the needs of "everyday" users who do not require specialist configurations or functionality. However, footnotes sometimes provide links or instructions for advanced users to undertake more complicated activities. Footnoting in this case reduces potential confusion for the larger {{project_name}} population.
* <u>Other non-essential information</u>: For simplicity, footnotes sometimes contain non-essential links, quotes, research articles and similar material for interested readers. 

To remove all doubt, novice or intermediate users can generally ignore footnotes unless experiencing difficulties with the particular software, activity or configuration in question. Footnotes are more valuable for those exploring topics in further detail, undertaking advanced configurations, performing development, or seeking answers to specific questions.

= Recommended Reading =

The documentation is lengthy, so newcomers to the {{project name}} platform or those with limited time should first read these sections:

* [[Warning|{{project_name}} and Tor Limitations]]
* [[DoNot|Tips on Remaining Anonymous]]
* The [[Download]] section for the relevant platform
* [[Post Install Advice|Post-installation Security Advice]]
* [[Surfing Posting Blogging|Surfing, Posting and Blogging]]

If users have more time available, it is suggested to read the [[Documentation]] widely, particularly the Basic Security Guide, Advanced Security Guide, and Computer Security Education sections. 

= Final Warning =

The {{project name}} design is intended to offer a technological means to stay anonymous on the Internet. However, it should be emphasized that staying anonymous is not simply a technological problem â€“ there is no tool, including {{project name}} and Tor, that magically provides Internet anonymity. It is necessary to change a host of behaviors as well. 

It is certainly helpful to have a deep, technical understanding of Internet architecture, [https://www.britannica.com/topic/cryptology cryptology], [https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/30202/hacking/tor-traffic-analysis-attack.html traffic analysis] techniques, and the applications that are in use; mainly by knowing what <u>not</u> to do. However, users with basic knowledge who proceed cautiously (using common sense) are likely to protect themselves adequately in most cases.
