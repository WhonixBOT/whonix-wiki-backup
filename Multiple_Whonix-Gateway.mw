Multiple {{gateway_product_name}} can be used alongside multiple {{workstation_product_name}}, but this has both advantages and disadvantages. One security benefit is the isolation of separate {{gateway_product_name}} VM instances. In the event that one {{gateway_product_name}} is compromised, it is not certain the other(s) will be similarly compromised. On the downside, newly cloned {{gateway_product_name}}(s) will end up with a different set of Tor entry guards unless precautions are taken. <ref>Such as manually configuring identical Tor entry guards. Qube-{{project_name}} users can [[Tor#Copy_Tor_Configuration_files_and_Settings_to_Another_sys-whonix_Instance|copy the Tor state folder to another <code>sys-whonix</code>]] instance or use the same [[Bridges]].</ref> <ref>At present, full instructions are not available for every {{non_q_project_name_short}} platform.</ref> 

In this configuration ISPs are probably capable of detecting that two different Tor data folders are in use, but this is not necessarily an anonymity threat. Similarly, if multiple Tor Browsers are used with distinct {{gateway_product_name}}, then a different set of Tor entry guards will be used as well (unless by chance the same Tor guards are chosen for different {{gateway_product_name}}).

When multiple {{gateway_product_name}} are run in parallel, the risks explained in the [[Multiple {{workstation_product_name_short}}#Safety_Precautions|Multiple {{workstation_product_name}}: Safety Precautions]] section equally apply.

== KVM ==

In this configuration, {{workstation_product_name}} will not be able to communicate with one another. This is recommended to keep different Tor activity profiles completely separate. To run multiple {{gateway_product_name}} it is necessary to clone existing VMs; the steps below assume an existing {{project name}} install.
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Create clones of the Gateway and Workstation VMs rolled back to clean snapshots.

In Virtual Machine Manager: <code>Highlight VM</code> &rarr; <code>Open</code> &rarr; <code>Virtual Machine</code> &rarr; <code>Clone...</code> &rarr; <code>Clone</code>

'''2.''' Export {{project name}} internal network settings.

<pre>
sudo virsh net-dumpxml Whonix-Internal > Whonix-Internal2.xml
</pre>

'''3.''' Edit the network configuration to make it unique.

* Change the '''name''' and '''bridge name'''.
* Delete the '''mac address''' and '''uuid''' parameters. 

Alternatively, replace the configuration with the example below (this assumes the only custom networks are {{project_name}}-related).

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
<network>
  <name>Whonix-Internal2</name>
  <bridge name='virbr3' stp='on' delay='0'/>
</network>
</pre>

Save and exit.

<pre>
CTRL-X
y
CTRL-M
</pre>

Note:

* <code>virbr1</code> is assigned to the <u>Whonix-External</u> network (NAT NIC); and 
* <code>virbr2</code> is assigned to the <u>Whonix-Internal</u> network ({{project_name}} NIC).

Therefore, the network name was changed to <code>internal2</code> and the bridge name to <code>virbr3</code>.

'''4.''' Import and start the new network.

<pre>
virsh -c qemu:///system net-define Whonix-Internal2.xml
</pre>

<pre>
virsh -c qemu:///system net-autostart Whonix-Internal2
</pre>

<pre>
virsh -c qemu:///system net-start Whonix-Internal2
</pre>

'''5.''' Attach the Gateway and Workstation VM NICs to the new network. 

Ensure that one Gateway NIC is attached to the external network. It is important to carefully match internal network interfaces to the new ones and not accidentally switch to a NIC that connects outside. 

To edit the VM virtual NIC settings: <br />
<code>Highlight VM</code> &rarr; <code>Open</code> &rarr; <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code>NIC virtual hardware</code> &rarr; Set Network Source to: <code>Virtual network 'Whonix-Internal2' : Isolated network, internal and host routing only</code>

Note that the network is exclusively internal and does not communicate with the host in any way.

'''6.''' Change the number of pinned CPUs.

It is recommended to [[KVM#Editing_an_imported_Machine.27s_XML_Configuration|edit]] the cloned workstation's configuration and change the number of pinned CPUs to a different value (3 or 4) compared to the existing gateway and primary workstation. This only works if users have a quad-core system.
}}
== VirtualBox ==

In this case, it is necessary to change the {{gateway_product_name}} network ''interface2'' and {{workstation_product_name}} network ''interface1'' from internal network <code>Whonix</code> to something else.

= {{q_project_name}} =

It is simple to create additional {{gateway_product_name}} (<code>sys-whonix</code> instances) in [[{{q_project_name_short}}|{{q_project_name}}]]; see 
[[Qubes/Create_Gateway_ProxyVMs|Create Gateway ProxyVMs]].

The only requirement is that the newly created <code>sys-whonix</code> is based on the <code>{{whonix-gw}}</code> TemplateVM and has a <u>distinctive VM name</u>, so it is not confused with other VMs.
