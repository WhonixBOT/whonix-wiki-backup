= Introduction =

Multiple [[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]] Templates provides much greater flexibility over a single template when choosing software packages. The additional cloned templates can be customized with software to meet specific requirements; something impossible to achieve with a single Template. <ref>Optionally, the default template can be cloned and used as the default template for App Qubes. Having a “known-good” backup template available at all times is best practice.</ref>

= Rationale =

* <u>Packages from a later release</u>: Installing packages from a later release could end up breaking the system. For example, mixing packages from [https://wiki.debian.org/DebianStable Debian Stable] with those of a later release like [https://wiki.debian.org/DebianTesting Debian Testing] can lead to an unstable system because of associated software dependencies required for full functionality. <ref>Using packages from different repositories can lead to [[Install Software#Dependency_Hell|Dependency Hell]].</ref> <ref>This problem can be avoided by cloning additional {{project name}} templates and preferring packages from a single repository in each Template.</ref> Prior to installing Debian packages from a later release, first read [[Install Software#Install_from_Debian_Testing|Install from Debian Testing]].
* <u>Custom software</u>: Additional cloned templates makes it easy to install custom software used for a specific application. For example, users could [[Tunnel UDP over Tor]] by configuring <code>{{whonix-ws}}</code> to route all applications through a VPN tunnel. However, this method also increases the risk of identity correlation. To mitigate this risk, the App Qube based on this template should only be used for the particular application that must be routed through the <i>tunnel-link</i>.  Before installing custom software it is recommended to first read [[Install Software#General_Advice|Install Software: General Advice]].
* <u>Untrusted packages</u>: It is unwise to install untrusted packages in a template used for sensitive activities. With multiple cloned Templates, a single template can be designated as a less trusted domain for that purpose. <ref>It is strongly encouraged to only install signed packages from a trusted source.</ref> Read [https://qubes-os.org/doc/software-update-vm/#notes-on-trusting-your-templatevms Notes on trusting your Template(s)] prior to installing untrusted packages.

== Qube Manager ==

Cloning templates in [[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]] is easily accomplished via Qube Manager. Be careful with naming conventions for both Templates and App Qubes (based on those templates) so they are not confused with each other. This will minimize the chance of basing an App Qube on the wrong template. 

When creating App Qubes based on cloned Templates, a purpose-based naming convention is sensible so there is no ambiguity regarding the intended function of an App Qube. For example, if an App Qube is created to tunnel UDP over Tor, appending <code>tunnel-udp</code> (the purpose) to the end of <code>anon-whonix</code> would lead to the name <code>anon-whonix-tunnel-udp</code>. 

To clone [[Qubes|{{q_project_name}}]] Templates, follow the steps below in Qube Manager:

<code>Qube Manager</code> &rarr; <code>VM to be Cloned</code> &rarr; <code>Clone qube</code> &rarr; <code>Enter name for Qube clone</code> <br />

'''Figure:''' ''Cloning {{project name}} qubes''<br />
[[Image:Screenshot-clone-vm-qubes.png]]

When prompted, give the newly cloned VM a name that is not easily confused with other VMs. This minimizes the chances of basing an App Qube on the wrong template; there could be serious security concerns if a "trusted" App Qube was based on the wrong Template with untrusted packages.

If you would like to change the UpdatesProxy setting for any Template, apply the following steps.

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' In dom0, open <code>/etc/qubes-rpc/policy/qubes.UpdatesProxy</code> with root rights.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo nano /etc/qubes-rpc/policy/qubes.UpdatesProxy
}}

TODO: the following steps require testing.

'''2.''' Add at the very top of that file.

Syntax:

<pre>
name-of-template-vm $default allow,target=name-of-proxy-vm
</pre>

For example:

{{CodeSelect|code=
whonix-ws-{{VersionShort}}-clone-1 $default allow,target=sys-whonix-cloned
}}

'''3.''' Save the file.

<pre>
<Ctrl-X> --> press Y --> <Enter>
</pre>

The procedure is now complete.
