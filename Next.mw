Add the following content.

We likely also need the following.

<pre>
del_onion *
</pre>

Perhaps others. To be tested.

Restart Control Port Filter Proxy.

<pre>
sudo service control-port-filter-python restart
</pre>

Inside Whonix-Workstation.

You need to use [https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/releases/tag/0.8 onionshare 0.8] or above, because it has the required support for ephemeral Tor hidden services. <ref>Tor control protocol command add_onion</ref> Install it from git.

Current status:

Even though Control Port Filter Proxy does not filter anything, it still does not work. It hangs at the following message.

<pre>
Connecting to Tor control port to set up hidden service on port 43826.
Staring ephemeral Tor hidden service and awaiting publication
</pre>

This is probably because [https://phabricator.whonix.org/T448 Control Port Filter Proxy does not yet support registering Tor control protocol events].

Let's finish development of [[#onionshare]] first. See above. Figuring out how to make onionshare work inside Whonix has made more progress.

Doesn't work yet, because Control Port Filter Proxy<ref>[[Dev/CPFP]]</ref> does not support wildcards yet. Might also not work for other reasons yet.

'''UNFINISHED!''' See: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/24

'''Advanced users only!'''

In Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation.

You need {{Code2|torbrowser-launcher}} installed. <ref>Because torbrowser-launcher ships The Tor Projects SSL certificate</ref> Currently only available from {{Code2|wheezy-backports}}.

To enable this on a by case base, use the --pin-tpo-cert command line option. Example.

<pre>
whonixcheck --pin-tpo-cert
</pre>

Or to permanently enable this.

Create a file {{Code2|/etc/whonix.d/50_user.conf}}.

sudo nano /etc/whonix.d/50_user.conf

Add.

= VPN before Tor =
User -> VPN -> Tor -> Internet

===== Preparation =====
Since setting up OpenVPN on Whonix-Gateway including a Fail Closed Mechanism is challenging, it is highly recommend to learn how to set up OpenVPN on Debian stable (currently: jessie). Get a Debian stable VM. Install the Debian openvpn package. (sudo apt-get install openvpn) Figure out how to set up your VPN using OpenVPN in the command line. Only proceed if you succeeded setting that up. Do not post support requests before you succeeded with that exercise. You find some help with general VPN setup in the [[#VPN Setup]] chapter or on the [[TestVPN]] page.

Whonix 12 users may remember variable VPN_SERVERS. Don't wonder. That variable was abolished for better security. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T460</ref>

After installing Whonix-Gateway, do the following steps before activating Tor in {{Code|Whonix Setup Wizard}}.

===== Firewall Settings =====
{{Firewall Settings}}

Add the following settings. You can skip comments (starting with {{Code|#}}). Don't use {{Code|;}} for comments. <ref>That config file is a bash fragment.</ref> Likely you do not need to either uncomment (removing the {{Code|#}} in front) or modify {{Code|VPN_INTERFACE}} / {{Code|LOCAL_NET}}.

<pre>
## Make sure Tor always connects through the VPN.
## Enable: 1
## Disable: 0
## DISABELD BY DEFAULT, because it requires a VPN provider.
VPN_FIREWALL=1

## For OpenVPN.
#VPN_INTERFACE=tun0

## Destinations you don not want routed through the VPN.
## 10.0.2.2-10.0.2.24: VirtualBox DHCP
#      LOCAL_NET="\
#         127.0.0.0-127.0.0.24 \
#         192.168.0.0-192.168.0.24 \
#         192.168.1.0-192.168.1.24 \
#         10.152.152.0-10.152.152.24 \
#         10.0.2.2-10.0.2.24 \
#      "
</pre>

Save.

===== Reload Firewall =====
{{Reload Firewall}}

===== sudoers configuration =====
{{Open with root rights|filename=

}}

Comment in. (Remove the single hashes ({{Code2|#}} in front of all lines, but do not remove the double hashes ({{Code2|##}}). So it looks like this.

<pre>
tunnel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/ip
tunnel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/openvpn *

</pre>

Save.

===== VPN Setup =====
====== Introduction ======
In the following example we are using the free RiseUp VPN, because it is known to support TCP, UDP, SSL. You can use any VPN you like.

====== Preparation ======
Since the following setup on Whonix-Gateway while using its Fail Closed Mechanism is difficult, it is highly recommended to learn how to set up your VPN provider using OpenVPN on Debian stable (currently: jessie).

TODO:

/etc/openvpn files need to be readable by user tunnel.

====== Get VPN Certificate ======
Look inside the [https://help.riseup.net/vpn riseup VPN help page] for [https://help.riseup.net/en/riseup-ca <code>RiseupCA.pem</code>] and (right click) [https://help.riseup.net/security/network-security/riseup-ca/RiseupCA.pem download] it. Store it in {{Code2|/etc/openvpn/RiseupCA.pem}}.

TODO: won't work without Tor being enabled

<pre>
scurl https://help.riseup.net/security/network-security/riseup-ca/RiseupCA.pem | sudo tee /etc/openvpn/RiseupCA.pem
</pre>

====== VPN Credentials ======
You need a riseup.net account. You need to know your riseup account name. Go to https://user.riseup.net/users/riseupusername/vpn to obtain your VPN secret. (VPN password) (Replace "riseupusername" with your actual riseup user name.) (Or just got to https://user.riseup.net, login and click on "VPN".) 

{{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/openvpn/auth.txt 
}}

Add. (Add your actual user name and password.)

<pre>
riseupusername
vpnsecret
</pre>

Save.

====== VPN IP Address ======
Note, you must use IP addresses. You cannot use DNS hostnames. For example, you could not use {{Code2|vpn.riseup.net}}. You have to use IP addresses such as for example {{Code2|198.252.153.226}}. You find out the IP from your provider or by using nslookup on the host. Example. (You need to use your actual DNS hostname, not {{Code2|vpn.riseup.net}}.)

<pre>
nslookup vpn.riseup.net
</pre>

====== VPN Configuration File ======
{{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/openvpn/openvpn.conf
}}

Add.

Note: make sure to adjust the {{Code|remote 198.252.153.226 80}} variable in your config (unless you are using {{Code|nyc.vpn.riseup.net}} as your VPN service). Replace the IP ({{Code|198.252.153.226}}) and port ({{Code|80}}) to match your VPN service.

</ref> <ref>We must run OpenVPN as user 'tunnel', because that is the only user besides user {{Code2|clearnet}} that will be allowed to establish external connections when using Whonix Firewall setting VPN_FIREWALL=1.</ref>

Save.

====== DNS Configuration ======
DNS configuration, update-resolv-conf or similar is not required for Whonix-Gateway. <ref>
Because Whonix-Gateway by default has no and needs no system DNS for its own traffic. See [[Whonix-Gateway System DNS]] if you would like to read an explanation why that is so.
</ref>

===== systemd setup =====
Create the OpenVPN systemd service file.

<pre>
sudo cp /lib/systemd/system/openvpn@.service /lib/systemd/system/openvpn@openvpn.service
</pre>

Enable the OpenVPN systemd service file.

<pre>
sudo systemctl enable openvpn@openvpn
</pre>

Start the OpenVPN systemd service.

<pre>
sudo service openvpn@openvpn start
</pre>

Check the OpenVPN systemd service status.

<pre>
sudo service openvpn@openvpn status
</pre>

TODO:

Make sure /var/run/openvpn is writable by user tunnel.

===== Enable Tor =====
Enable Tor using Whonix Setup Wizard.

{{whonixsetup}}

===== Troubleshooting =====
Permission issue.
<pre>
Options error: --status fails with '/run/openvpn/openvpn.status': Permission denied
</pre>

Do not start openvpn as root. Do not use "sudo openvpn". This would lead to permission issues. Files in /run/openvpn folder owned by root. So they cannot be overwritten by user tunnel.

Debug start in command line.

<pre>
cd /etc/openvpn/
sudo -u tunnel openvpn /etc/openvpn/openvpn.conf
</pre>

Ip link set issue.

<pre>
Linux ip link set failed: external program exited with error status: 2
</pre>

Use ip_unpriv as documented above.

Dev tun missmatch.

In openvpn.conf do not use.

<pre>
dev tun
</pre>

Use.

<pre>
dev tun0
</pre>
