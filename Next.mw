In Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation.

You need {{Code2|torbrowser-launcher}} installed. <ref>Because torbrowser-launcher ships The Tor Projects SSL certificate</ref> Currently only available from {{Code2|wheezy-backports}}.

To enable this on a by case base, use the --pin-tpo-cert command line option. Example.

<pre>
whonixcheck --pin-tpo-cert
</pre>

Or to permanently enable this.

Create a file {{Code2|/etc/whonix.d/50_user}}.

<pre>
sudo nano /etc/whonix.d/50_user
</pre>
