Doesn't work yet, because Control Port Filter Proxy<ref>[[Dev/CPFP]]</ref> does not support wildcards yet. Might also not work for other reasons yet.

Security implications not researched yet.

On Whonix-Gateway, Control Port Filter Proxy needs some adjustments.

Create a file {{Code|/etc/cpfpy.d/50_controlportfilt_ricochet}}.

<pre>
kdesudo kwrite /etc/cpfpy.d/50_controlportfilt_torsion
</pre>

Add the following content.

<pre>
## Keep existing contents of variable CONTROL_PORT_FILTER_WHITELIST
## and extend it with control port commands required by torsion as per:
## "Documentation request for Whonix setup"
## https://github.com/special/torsion/issues/30
CONTROL_PORT_FILTER_WHITELIST=GETINFO status/circuit-established,SETCONF HiddenServiceDir,SETCONF HiddenServicePort,SETEVENTS STATUS_CLIENT
</pre>

Restart Control Port Filter Proxy.

<pre>
sudo service control-port-filter-python restart
</pre>

'''UNFINISHED!''' See: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/24

'''Advanced users only!'''

In Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation.

You need {{Code2|torbrowser-launcher}} installed. <ref>Because torbrowser-launcher ships The Tor Projects SSL certificate</ref> Currently only available from {{Code2|wheezy-backports}}.

To enable this on a by case base, use the --pin-tpo-cert command line option. Example.

<pre>
whonixcheck --pin-tpo-cert
</pre>

Or to permanently enable this.

Create a file {{Code2|/etc/whonix.d/50_user}}.

<pre>
sudo nano /etc/whonix.d/50_user
</pre>

Add.

<pre>
PIN_TPO_CERT="true"
