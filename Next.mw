'''Documentation for the NEXT Whonix version! ONLY for developers! No gurantee it really makes into the next Whonix version.'''

= Tor Browser =
See [[Language]]

= DNS on Whonix-Gateway =
{{Testing}}

Working.

Explanation http://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/41116dda/

<pre>
sudo chattr -i /etc/resolv.conf
sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf
sudo service networking restart
sudo su clearnet
ping google.com
# working
</pre>

= Remove Proxy Settings =
{{Testing}}

You could use Tor Button's settings dialog to set it to any other proxy.

For an alternative method, not using the Tor Button graphical user interface, see footnote <ref>If you want to set it to no proxy, you could additionally add in ~/tor-browser_en-US/start-tor-browser below "#!/bin/sh".

<pre>export TOR_TRANSPROXY=1</pre>

Or add to /etc/environment

<pre>TOR_TRANSPROXY=1</pre>
</ref>.

= uwt =
{{Testing}}

We no longer place uwt wrappers into /usr/local/bin/<uwt-wrapped-application>. Therefore we now use dpkg-divert /usr/bin/<uwt-wrapped-application> to /usr/bin/<uwt-wrapped-application> and symlink /usr/bin/<uwt-wrapped-application> to /usr/bin/uwtwrapper.

Search for /usr/bin/* in documentation and update to /usr/bin/<uwt-wrapped-application>.real.

apt-cacher-ng-uwt moved to /usr/share/whonix/.

= Tor Controller =
{{Testing}}

Change documentation from arm to armwrapper.

= Dummy Tor =
{{Testing}}

Update dummy tor design page.

= Trust =
{{Testing}}

Added to [[Trust]].

= System Requirements =
{{Testing}}

1024x768 for terminal (before the desktop environment starts) set in /etc/default/grub, unless manually reduced.

128 MB RAM for Whonix-Gateway without graphical desktop environment. Or 768 MB RAM for Whonix-Gateway with graphical desktop environment

768 MB RAM for Whonix-Workstation with graphical desktop environment. (Or <ref>128 MB RAM for Whonix-Workstation without graphical desktop environment.</ref>.)

= whonixcheck/timesync writing to tty1 =
See [[Desktop]]

= Autostart Desktop Environment based on Free RAM and Other Settings =
See [[Desktop]]

= Config Files =
{{Testing}}

* /etc/whonix.d
* /etc/whonix_firewall.d
* /etc/controlportfilt.d (Only on Whonix-Gateway.)

<pre>
## Please use "/etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_user" for your custom configuration,
## which will override the defaults found here. When Whonix is updated, this 
## file may be overwritten.
</pre>

<pre>
## Instead of editing this file, please create and use the file
## "/etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_user". When Whonix is updated, 
## "/etc/whonix_firewall.d/30_default" will be overwritten. Files in folder 
## "/etc/whonix_firewall.d/" are sourced in alphabetical order. Anything in 
## "/etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_user" will always override the defaults,
## allowing the user to keep their settings after updating Whonix.
</pre>

= Skipping Postinst Scripts =
{{Testing}}

'''Advanced users only!'''

Lets say for example you don't like the <code>/usr/share/whonix/postinst.d/70_desktopicons</code> postinst script creating Desktop icons each time an update from Whonix apt repository comes.

Once you identified which ones you don't like, just run

<pre>
export WHONIX_BUILD_SKIP_SCRIPTS+=" 20_sanity_checks "
</pre>

before running "<code>apt-get dist-upgrade</code>".

Or you could add them the the <code>WHONIX_BUILD_SKIP_SCRIPTS</code> environment variable separated by spaces to <code>/etc/environment</code>, example.

<pre>
WHONIX_BUILD_SKIP_SCRIPTS="70_desktopicons 70_knetattach 70_whonix_apt_key"
</pre>

After changing <code>/etc/environment</code>, you need to reboot.

In case this feature is of interest to you, a solution for not requiring reboot and adding them to a config file in <code>/etc/whonix.d</code> could be easily and quickly added. Just request a feature in that case.
