Doesn't work yet, because Control Port Filter Proxy<ref>[[Dev/CPFP]]</ref> does not support wildcards yet. Might also not work for other reasons yet.

Security implications not researched yet.

On Whonix-Gateway, Control Port Filter Proxy needs some adjustments.

{{Open with root rights|
filename=/etc/cpfpy.d/50_ricochet.conf
}}

Add the following content.

<pre>
## Keep existing contents of variable CONTROL_PORT_FILTER_WHITELIST
## and extend it with control port commands required by torsion as per:
## "Documentation request for Whonix setup"
## https://github.com/special/torsion/issues/30
CONTROL_PORT_FILTER_WHITELIST=GETINFO status/circuit-established,SETCONF HiddenServiceDir,SETCONF HiddenServicePort,SETEVENTS STATUS_CLIENT
</pre>

Restart Control Port Filter Proxy.

<pre>
sudo service control-port-filter-python restart
</pre>

On Whonix-Gateway.

Needs Tor 0.2.7.5 or higher.

{{Open with root rights|

Control Port Filter Proxy<ref>[[Dev/CPFP]]</ref> needs some adjustments.

{{Open with root rights|
filename=/etc/cpfpy.d/50_onionshare.conf
}}

Add the following content.

<pre>
## Keep existing contents of variable CONTROL_PORT_FILTER_WHITELIST
## and extend it with control port commands required by onionshare as per:
## https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/blob/master/onionshare/onionshare.py
CONTROL_PORT_FILTER_WHITELIST=PROTOCOLINFO 1,SETCONF HiddenServiceDir,SETCONF HiddenServicePort
</pre>

We would also have to add something like this.

<pre>
add_onion new:best port=80,60132
</pre>

I.e. something like this.

<pre>
add_onion *:* port=*,*
</pre>

Or something like this.

<pre>
add_onion *
</pre>

We likely also need the following.

<pre>
del_onion *
</pre>

Perhaps others. To be tested.

But this is not supported yet by CPFP, because [https://phabricator.whonix.org/T445 CONTROL_PORT_FILTER_WHITELIST wildcard feature] is not yet implemented. (The virtport number (60132) is variable.)

Strictly for testing purposes (dangerous once Whonix-Workstation has been compromised!), we could add the following debugging option to let all Tor control port commands pass without any filtering.

<pre>
CONTROL_PORT_FILTER_DISABLE_FILTERING=true
</pre>

Restart Control Port Filter Proxy.

<pre>
sudo service control-port-filter-python restart
</pre>

Inside Whonix-Workstation.

[https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/issues/232#issuecomment-162349804 Requires] python-stem 1.3.0 or higher.

Current status:

Even though Control Port Filter Proxy does not filter anything, it still does not work. It hangs at the following message.

<pre>
Connecting to Tor control port to set up hidden service on port 43826.
Staring ephemeral Tor hidden service and awaiting publication
</pre>

This is probably because [https://phabricator.whonix.org/T448 Control Port Filter Proxy does not yet support registering Tor control protocol events].

'''UNFINISHED!''' See: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/24

'''Advanced users only!'''

In Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation.

You need {{Code2|torbrowser-launcher}} installed. <ref>Because torbrowser-launcher ships The Tor Projects SSL certificate</ref> Currently only available from {{Code2|wheezy-backports}}.

To enable this on a by case base, use the --pin-tpo-cert command line option. Example.

<pre>
whonixcheck --pin-tpo-cert
</pre>

Or to permanently enable this.

Create a file {{Code2|/etc/whonix.d/50_user.conf}}.

<pre>
sudo nano /etc/whonix.d/50_user.conf
</pre>

Add.

<pre>
PIN_TPO_CERT="true"
