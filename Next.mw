* /etc/whonix.d
* /etc/whonix_firewall.d
* /etc/controlportfilt.d (Only on Whonix-Gateway.)

<pre>
## Please use "/etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_user" for your custom configuration,
## which will override the defaults found here. When Whonix is updated, this 
## file may be overwritten.
</pre>

<pre>
## Instead of editing this file, please create and use the file
## "/etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_user". When Whonix is updated, 
## "/etc/whonix_firewall.d/30_default" will be overwritten. Files in folder 
## "/etc/whonix_firewall.d/" are sourced in alphabetical order. Anything in 
## "/etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_user" will always override the defaults,
## allowing the user to keep their settings after updating Whonix.
</pre>

= Skipping Postinst Scripts =
{{Stable}}

'''Advanced users only!'''

Let's say for example you don't like the <code>/usr/share/whonix/postinst.d/70_desktopicons</code> postinst script creating Desktop icons each time an update from Whonix apt repository comes.

Once you identified which ones you don't like, just run

<pre>
export WHONIX_BUILD_SKIP_SCRIPTS+=" 20_sanity_checks "
</pre>

before running "<code>apt-get dist-upgrade</code>".

Or you could add them to the <code>WHONIX_BUILD_SKIP_SCRIPTS</code> environment variable separated by spaces to <code>/etc/environment</code>, example.

<pre>
WHONIX_BUILD_SKIP_SCRIPTS="70_desktopicons 70_knetattach 70_whonix_apt_key"
</pre>

After changing <code>/etc/environment</code>, you need to reboot.

In case this feature is of interest to you, a solution for not requiring reboot and adding them to a config file in <code>/etc/whonix.d</code> could be easily and quickly added. Just request a feature in that case.

= Known Minor Issues =
== "apt-get source package" will show "dpkg-source: warning: failed to verify signature" ==
More info [http://lists.debian.org/debian-derivatives/2013/08/msg00000.html here] (and in the following mails).

It is only a warning. If you want, you can get rid of it with the following workaround.

1. Modify <code>/etc/dpkg/origins/default</code>.

<pre>
sudo unlink /etc/dpkg/origins/default
sudo ln -s /etc/dpkg/origins/debian /etc/dpkg/origins/default
</pre>

2. {{Code|apt-get source package}}

3. Undo afterwards to prevent unexpected issues.

<pre>
sudo unlink /etc/dpkg/origins/default
sudo ln -s /etc/dpkg/origins/whonix /etc/dpkg/origins/default
</pre>
