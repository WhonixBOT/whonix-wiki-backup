On Whonix-Gateway, Control Port Filter Proxy<ref>[[Dev/CPFP]]</ref> needs some adjustments.

Create a file {{Code|/etc/controlportfilt.d/50_controlportfilt_torsion}}.

<pre>
kdesudo kwrite /etc/controlportfilt.d/50_controlportfilt_torsion
</pre>

Add the following content.

<pre>
## Keep existing contents of variable CONTROL_PORT_FILTER_WHITELIST
## and extend it with control port commands required by torsion as per:
## "Documentation request for Whonix setup"
## https://github.com/special/torsion/issues/30
CONTROL_PORT_FILTER_WHITELIST=(
    "${CONTROL_PORT_FILTER_WHITELIST[@]}"
    "GETINFO status/circuit-established"
    "SETCONF HiddenServiceDir"
    "SETCONF HiddenServicePort"
    "SETEVENTS STATUS_CLIENT"
)
</pre>

Restart Control Port Filter Proxy.

<pre>
sudo service controlportfiltd restart
</pre>
