= Remove Proxy Settings =
{{Testing}}

You could use Tor Button's settings dialog to set it to any other proxy.

For an alternative method, not using the Tor Button graphical user interface, see footnote <ref>If you want to set it to no proxy, you could additionally add in ~/tor-browser_en-US/start-tor-browser below "#!/bin/sh".

<pre>export TOR_TRANSPROXY=1</pre>

Or add to /etc/environment

<pre>TOR_TRANSPROXY=1</pre>
</ref>.

= uwt =
{{Testing}}

We no longer place uwt wrappers into /usr/local/bin/<uwt-wrapped-application>. Therefore we now use dpkg-divert /usr/bin/<uwt-wrapped-application> to /usr/bin/<uwt-wrapped-application> and symlink /usr/bin/<uwt-wrapped-application> to /usr/bin/uwtwrapper.

Search for /usr/bin/* in documentation and update to /usr/bin/<uwt-wrapped-application>.real.

apt-cacher-ng-uwt moved to /usr/share/whonix/.

= Tor Controller =
{{Testing}}

Change documentation from arm to armwrapper.

= Dummy Tor =
{{Testing}}

Update dummy tor design page.

= Trust =
{{Testing}}

Added to [[Trust]].

{{Testing}}

128 MB RAM for Whonix-Gateway without graphical desktop environment 768 MB RAM for Whonix-Gateway with graphical desktop environment

128 MB RAM for Whonix-Workstation without graphical desktop environment 768 MB RAM for Whonix-Workstation with graphical desktop environment

= whonixcheck/timesync writing to tty1 =
{{Testing}}

Its difficult to keep terminal users, i.e. for users who are not using a graphical desktop environment, posted with the status if their system. Therefore two applications coming with Whonix, timesync and whonixcheck, will do something unique, or at least very rare.

Even if you are logged into your terminal tty1 and see a command prompt, it can happen that you suddenly see status messages from whonixcheck or timesync. This can be nice for example once your Whonix-Gateway configured to your liking (if you needed to do that at all) and just want to get posted with status messages about your system. On the other hand, this can be disturbing, if you're currently doing something, like editing a configuration file and then suddenly status messages are written to your screen. In that case, it's advises to log into tty other than tty1, for example tty2.

* Default-Download-Version users can use the Virtual Box host key (right ctrl by default) and F2: right ctrl + F2
* Physical isolation users can use the standard feature, which comes with Debian: ctrl + ALT + F2
