'''Documentation for the NEXT Whonix version! ONLY for developers! No gurantee it really makes into the next Whonix version.'''

= Tor Browser =

Available languages as in October 2012:

<pre>
ar
de
en-US
es-ES
fa
fr
it
ko
nl
pl
pt-PT
ru
vi
zh-CN
</pre>

To check if further languages are supported visit https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/linux/ or http://idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion/dist/torbrowser/linux/.

Always use.

<pre>export TB_LANG="<language code>"</pre>

to set the language before running the Tor Browser Updater.

For example, for Vietnamese use:

<pre>export TB_LANG="vi"</pre>

Replace "vi" with "zh-CN" for Chinese and so on.

= DNS on Whonix-Gateway =

Working.

Explanation http://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/41116dda/

<pre>
sudo chattr -i /etc/resolv.conf
sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf
sudo service networking restart
sudo su clearnet
ping google.com
# working
</pre>

= Remove Proxy Settings =

Open ''start-tor-browser'' in the root of the Tor Browser folder and add right below ''#!/bin/sh''. <sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup> <sup>3</sup> <sup>4</sup>

<pre>
unset TOR_SOCKS_HOST
unset TOR_SOCKS_PORT
</pre>

Now you could use Tor Button's settings dialog to set it to any other proxy.

Alternatively, if you want to set it to no proxy, you could additionally add below "''unset TOR_SOCKS_PORT''".

<pre>export TOR_TRANSPROXY=1</pre>

= uwt =

We no longer place uwt wrappers into /usr/local/bin/<uwt-wrapped-application>. Therefore we now use dpkg-divert /usr/bin/<uwt-wrapped-application> to /usr/bin/<uwt-wrapped-application> and symlink /usr/bin/<uwt-wrapped-application> to /usr/bin/uwtwrapper.

Search for /usr/bin/* in documentation and update to /usr/bin/<uwt-wrapped-application>.real.

apt-cacher-ng-uwt moved to /usr/share/whonix/.

= Tor Controller =

Change documentation from arm to armwrapper.

= Dummy Tor =

Update dummy tor design page.

= Trust =

Added to [[Trust]].

= System Requirements =
1024x768 for terminal (before the desktop environment starts) set in /etc/default/grub, unless manually reduced.

128 MB RAM for Whonix-Gateway without graphical desktop environment 768 MB RAM for Whonix-Gateway with graphical desktop environment

128 MB RAM for Whonix-Workstation without graphical desktop environment 768 MB RAM for Whonix-Workstation with graphical desktop environment

= whonixcheck/timesync writing to tty1 =

Its difficult to keep terminal users, i.e. for users who are not using a graphical desktop environment, posted with the status if their system. Therefore two applications coming with Whonix, timesync and whonixcheck, will do something unique, or at least very rare.

Even if you are logged into your terminal tty1 and see a command prompt, it can happen that you suddenly see status messages from whonixcheck or timesync. This can be nice for example once your Whonix-Gateway configured to your liking (if you needed to do that at all) and just want to get posted with status messages about your system. On the other hand, this can be disturbing, if you're currently doing something, like editing a configuration file and then suddenly status messages are written to your screen. In that case, it's advises to log into tty other than tty1, for example tty2.

* Default-Download-Version users can use the Virtual Box host key (right ctrl by default) and F2: right ctrl + F2
* Physical isolation users can use the standard feature, which comes with Debian: ctrl + ALT + F2

= Autostart Desktop Environment based on Free RAM and Other Settings =

When booting up, you will be prompted and can always manually press ctrl + c to prevent KDE from starting.

By default, since Whonix 0.6.2, Whonix-Gateway comes with 768 MB virtual RAM. This can be reduced on systems with low resources.

* If there is more than 512 MB RAM in total, the desktop environment (KDE by default) will be started.
* If less than 512 MB RAM in total (for example, only 128 MB RAM in total), KDE (kdm) will not be started.

This should be be quite convenient, because users with low RAM could reduce (Whonix-Gateway) RAM to 128 MB and even if they sometimes wanted to configure/check something, they could assign 512 RAM and automagically boot into the graphical KDE desktop. There are also many settings in /etc/whonix.d/ to configure this feature, so if you want, you can also add a lot RAM and still don't boot into a desktop environment, use different display managers and so on.
