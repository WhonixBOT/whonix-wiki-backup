= Remove Proxy Settings =
{{Testing}}

You could use Tor Button's settings dialog to set it to any other proxy.

For an alternative method, not using the Tor Button graphical user interface, see footnote <ref>If you want to set it to no proxy, you could additionally add in ~/tor-browser_en-US/start-tor-browser below "#!/bin/sh".

<pre>export TOR_TRANSPROXY=1</pre>

Or add to /etc/environment

<pre>TOR_TRANSPROXY=1</pre>
</ref>.

= uwt =
{{Testing}}

We no longer place uwt wrappers into /usr/local/bin/<uwt-wrapped-application>. Therefore we now use dpkg-divert /usr/bin/<uwt-wrapped-application> to /usr/bin/<uwt-wrapped-application> and symlink /usr/bin/<uwt-wrapped-application> to /usr/bin/uwtwrapper.

Search for /usr/bin/* in documentation and update to /usr/bin/<uwt-wrapped-application>.real.

apt-cacher-ng-uwt moved to /usr/share/whonix/.

= Tor Controller =
{{Testing}}

Change documentation from arm to armwrapper.

= Dummy Tor =
