Security implications not researched yet.

On Whonix-Gateway, Control Port Filter Proxy<ref>[[Dev/CPFP]]</ref> needs some adjustments.

Create a file {{Code|/etc/controlportfilt.d/50_controlportfilt_torsion}}.

<pre>
kdesudo kwrite /etc/controlportfilt.d/50_controlportfilt_torsion
</pre>

Add the following content.

<pre>
## Keep existing contents of variable CONTROL_PORT_FILTER_WHITELIST
## and extend it with control port commands required by torsion as per:
## "Documentation request for Whonix setup"
## https://github.com/special/torsion/issues/30
CONTROL_PORT_FILTER_WHITELIST=(
    "${CONTROL_PORT_FILTER_WHITELIST[@]}"
    "GETINFO status/circuit-established"
    "SETCONF HiddenServiceDir"
    "SETCONF HiddenServicePort"
    "SETEVENTS STATUS_CLIENT"
)
</pre>

Restart Control Port Filter Proxy.

<pre>
sudo service controlportfiltd restart
</pre>

= VPN on Whonix-Gateway =
Have a look at {{Code|/etc/whonix_firewall.d/30_default}}. To open.

<pre>
Start menu -> Applications -> System -> Whonix Default Firewall Settings
</pre>

It contains default settings, settings you can use as template (copy and paste) and an interesting comment.

<pre>
## Please use "/etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_user" for your custom configuration,
## which will override the defaults found here. When Whonix is updated, this
## file may be overwritten.
</pre>

Create a file  {{Code|/etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_user}}. If you are using a graphical Whonix-Gateway, use.

<pre>
Start menu -> Applications -> System -> Whonix User Firewall Settings
</pre>

If you are using a terminal-only Whonix-Gateway, use.

<pre>
sudo nano /etc/whonix_firewall.d/30_default
</pre>
