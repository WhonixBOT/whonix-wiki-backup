* I2P Tunnels Settings

Set the Inbound and Outbound Tunnel Length to 0:

}}<ref>It's faster and less connection interrupts. Anonymity is already provided by Tor. No need to leech from Tor/I2P.</ref>

* I2P Router Configuration
(Explanation in order)
<ref>
*change router identity and UDP port when IP changes \n   
*Enable NTCP https://geti2p.net/en/docs/transport/ntcp   
*Disable automatic IP fetching # We dont want/need to publish the Exit-Node IP
*Disable Ipv6 for the NTCP #Unsupported by Tor so we dont need it
*Number of concurrent NTCP connections # Reduced Connections so we dont overload the Tor node with connection attempts
*Disable Udp #Unsupported by Tor
*Sets the source of IP detection
*We dont want/need to publish the Exit-Node IP
*Disable Ipv6 for Udp
*toggles UPNP off # No need for Upnp
*Don't save your IP in the netDB and publish to other I2P routers( https://trac.i2p2.de/ticket/1314#comment:3)
*Sets the bandwidth that is max used by particiapting tunnels # We dont participate in Traffic so no need to share
*Disable In-network Updates # We use apt for that
*Disable time comparisation in I2P router
*Set ntp timesource to localhost

==== Preparation ====
You need newer control port filter / upgrade to Whonix 14 developers-only. You get it by upgrading to Whonix 14 developers-only.

Upgrade both Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation to Whonix 14 developers-only. For instructions see:  [[Dev/Control_Port_Filter_Proxy#tor-controlport-filter_by_Tails]].

==== Configure Control Port Filter Proxy ====
On Whonix-Gateway.

Control Port Filter Proxy needs some adjustments.

{{Open with root rights|
filename=/etc/tor-controlport-filter.d/whonix.yml
}}

Add the following content.

(Must make sure in the following wiki markup using CodeSelect no pipe | is included since that is not supported by CodeSelect. Working version that can be used can also be found [https://phabricator.whonix.org/T574#10972 here].)

Restart Control Port Filter Proxy.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo service tor-controlport-filter restart
}}

==== Firewall Unload - Crude ====
Inside Whonix-Workstation.

Unload Whonix-Workstation firewall: [[Dev/Firewall_Unload]]

(These instructions will be gone in the final version.)

==== Configure Whonix-Workstation Firewall  ====
This Firewall Unload instructions are not yet tested. (The above are.)

Inside Whonix-Workstation.
<ref>As per https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/7870#note-15 onionshare uses ports 17600 to 17659.</ref>

{{Firewall Settings Workstation}}

Add.

{{CodeSelect|code=
EXTERNAL_OPEN_PORTS+=" $(seq 17600 17659) "
}}

Save.

{{Reload_Firewall_Whonix-Workstation}}

==== enable backports  ====
Add Debian Jessie Backports to repos sources lists.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo su -c "echo -e 'deb http://http.debian.net/debian jessie-backports main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jessie-backports.list"
}}

{{Apt-Pinning}}

==== Install Dependencies ====
[[Update]] your package lists.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}

Install the dependencies from jessie-backports. <ref>[https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/issues/232#issuecomment-162349804 Requires] [https://packages.debian.org/de/jessie-backports/python3-stem python3-stem] 1.4.1b-1~bpo8+1 or higher. Can be installed from Debian backports.</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends -t jessie-backports python3-stem python3-flask python3-pyqt5 python-nautilus
}}

==== Install onionshare ====
You need to use [https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/releases/tag/v0.9.1 onionshare 0.9.1] or above, because it has the required support for ephemeral Tor hidden services. <ref>Tor control protocol command add_onion</ref> Install it from git.

Let's finish development of [[#onionshare]] first. See above. Figuring out how to make onionshare work inside Whonix has made more progress.

Security implications not researched yet.

On Whonix-Gateway, Control Port Filter Proxy needs some adjustments.

{{Open with root rights|

Add the following content.

Restart Control Port Filter Proxy.

sudo service control-port-filter-python restart

== How ==
'''UNFINISHED!''' See: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/24

'''Advanced users only!'''

In Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation.

You need {{Code2|torbrowser-launcher}} installed. <ref>Because torbrowser-launcher ships The Tor Projects SSL certificate</ref> Currently only available from {{Code2|wheezy-backports}}.

To enable this on a by case base, use the --pin-tpo-cert command line option. Example.

<pre>
whonixcheck --pin-tpo-cert
</pre>

Or to permanently enable this.

Create a file {{Code2|/etc/whonix.d/50_user.conf}}.

<pre>
sudo nano /etc/whonix.d/50_user.conf
</pre>

Add.

<pre>
PIN_TPO_CERT="true"
