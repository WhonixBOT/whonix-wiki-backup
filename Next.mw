'''Documentation for the NEXT {{project name}} version! ONLY for developers! No guarantee it really makes into the next {{project name}} version.'''

[[OnionShare]] is installed by default, no need to get with git.

4. Adjust I2P Settings:

* I2P Tunnels Settings

Set the Inbound and Outbound Tunnel Length to 0:
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo sed -i "s/\(.*outbound.length=\).*/\10/g;s/\(.*inbound.length=\).*/\10/g" "/var/lib/i2p/i2p-config/i2ptunnel.config"
}}<ref>It is faster and less connection interrupts. Anonymity is already provided by Tor. No need to leech from Tor/I2P.</ref>

* I2P Router Configuration
(Explanation in order)
<ref>
*change router identity and UDP port when IP changes \n   
*Enable NTCP https://geti2p.net/en/docs/transport/ntcp   
*Disable automatic IP fetching # We dont want/need to publish the Exit-Node IP
*Disable Ipv6 for the NTCP #Unsupported by Tor so we dont need it
*Number of concurrent NTCP connections # Reduced Connections so we dont overload the Tor node with connection attempts
*Disable Udp #Unsupported by Tor
*Sets the source of IP detection
*We dont want/need to publish the Exit-Node IP
*Disable Ipv6 for Udp
*toggles UPNP off # No need for Upnp
*Don't save your IP in the netDB and publish to other I2P routers( https://trac.i2p2.de/ticket/1314#comment:3)
*Sets the bandwidth that is max used by particiapting tunnels # We dont participate in Traffic so no need to share
*Disable In-network Updates # We use apt for that
*Disable time comparisation in I2P router
*Set ntp timesource to localhost

}}<ref>UDP is unsupported by Tor. Only outgoing TCP supported by Tor. If you know to use an onion service, please add this information. Incoming connections are not possible, because [[Install_Software#{{workstation_product_name}}_is_firewalled|{{workstation_product_name}} is firewalled]].</ref><ref>Clock Skew Issues: There should be none anymore since {{project name}} 9 so configuring '''time.sntpServerList=localhost''' is no longer necessary.
