* I2P Tunnels Settings

Set the Inbound and Outbound Tunnel Length to 0:
{{CodeSelect|code=

}}<ref>It's faster and less connection interrupts. Anonymity is already provided by Tor. No need to leech from Tor/I2P.</ref>

* I2P Router Configuration
(Explanation in order)
<ref>
*change router identity and UDP port when IP changes \n   
*Enable NTCP https://geti2p.net/en/docs/transport/ntcp   
*Disable automatic IP fetching # We dont want/need to publish the Exit-Node IP
*Disable Ipv6 for the NTCP #Unsupported by Tor so we dont need it
*Number of concurrent NTCP connections # Reduced Connections so we dont overload the Tor node with connection attempts
*Disable Udp #Unsupported by Tor
*Sets the source of IP detection
*We dont want/need to publish the Exit-Node IP
*Disable Ipv6 for Udp
*toggles UPNP off # No need for Upnp
*Don't save your IP in the netDB and publish to other I2P routers( https://trac.i2p2.de/ticket/1314#comment:3)
*Sets the bandwidth that is max used by particiapting tunnels # We dont participate in Traffic so no need to share
*Disable In-network Updates # We use apt for that
*Disable time comparisation in I2P router
*Set ntp timesource to localhost

TODO [https://github.com/Whonix/control-port-filter-python control-port-filter-python]:
* [https://phabricator.whonix.org/T448 Control Port Filter Proxy does not yet support registering Tor control protocol events]
<br />
On Whonix-Gateway.

Needs Tor 0.2.7.5 or higher.

{{Open with root rights|
filename=/etc/apt/sources.list.d/torproject.list
}}

Add.

<pre>
deb http://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org tor-experimental-0.2.7.x-jessie main
</pre>

Save.

[[Update]] package lists and dist-upgrade.

<pre>
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
</pre>

Control Port Filter Proxy<ref>[[Dev/CPFP]]</ref> needs some adjustments.

{{Open with root rights|
filename=/etc/cpfpy.d/50_onionshare.conf
}}

Add the following content.

<pre>
CONTROL_PORT_FILTER_ALLOW_WILDCARDS=true

## Keep existing contents of variable CONTROL_PORT_FILTER_WHITELIST
## and extend it with control port commands required by onionshare as per:
## https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/blob/master/onionshare/onionshare.py
CONTROL_PORT_FILTER_WHITELIST=protocolinfo 1
CONTROL_PORT_FILTER_WHITELIST=getinfo version
CONTROL_PORT_FILTER_WHITELIST=add_onion *
</pre>

We likely also need the following.

<pre>
del_onion *
</pre>

Perhaps others. To be tested.

Restart Control Port Filter Proxy.

<pre>
sudo service control-port-filter-python restart
</pre>

Inside Whonix-Workstation.

You need to use [https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/releases/tag/0.8 onionshare 0.8] or above, because it has the required support for ephemeral Tor hidden services. <ref>Tor control protocol command add_onion</ref> Install it from git.

[https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/issues/232#issuecomment-162349804 Requires] [https://packages.debian.org/de/jessie-backports/python-stem python-stem] 1.3.0 or higher. Can be installed from Debian backports.

Add Debian Jessie Backports to repos sources lists.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo su -c "echo -e 'deb http://http.debian.net/debian jessie-backports main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jessie-backports.list"
}}

{{Apt-Pinning}}

[[Update]] your package lists.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}

Install python-stem.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get -t jessie-backports install python-stem
}}


Current status:

Even though Control Port Filter Proxy does not filter anything, it still does not work. It hangs at the following message.

<pre>
Connecting to Tor control port to set up hidden service on port 43826.
Staring ephemeral Tor hidden service and awaiting publication
</pre>

This is probably because [https://phabricator.whonix.org/T448 Control Port Filter Proxy does not yet support registering Tor control protocol events].

Security implications not researched yet.

Let's finish development of [[#onionshare]] first. See above. Figuring out how to make onionshare work inside Whonix has made more progress.

On Whonix-Gateway, Control Port Filter Proxy needs some adjustments.

{{Open with root rights|
filename=/etc/cpfpy.d/50_ricochet.conf

Add the following content.

<pre>
## Keep existing contents of variable CONTROL_PORT_FILTER_WHITELIST
## and extend it with control port commands required by torsion as per:
## "Documentation request for Whonix setup"
## https://github.com/special/torsion/issues/30

Restart Control Port Filter Proxy.

'''UNFINISHED!''' See: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/24

'''Advanced users only!'''

In Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation.

You need {{Code2|torbrowser-launcher}} installed. <ref>Because torbrowser-launcher ships The Tor Projects SSL certificate</ref> Currently only available from {{Code2|wheezy-backports}}.

To enable this on a by case base, use the --pin-tpo-cert command line option. Example.

<pre>
whonixcheck --pin-tpo-cert
</pre>

Or to permanently enable this.

Create a file {{Code2|/etc/whonix.d/50_user.conf}}.

<pre>
sudo nano /etc/whonix.d/50_user.conf
</pre>

Add.

<pre>
PIN_TPO_CERT="true"
