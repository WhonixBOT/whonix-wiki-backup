= End-of-life Software =

Users should not run software that has reached end-of-life status, because developers will not fix existing defects, bugs or vulnerabilities, posing serious security risks.

A recent example is [https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4203 VLC in Debian jessie], which reached end-of-life status in May, 2018. In that case, Whonix 13 users who did not utilize a different media player were at risk, because VLC in jessie has current unpatched security vulnerabilities. <ref>This does not apply to the current stable Whonix 14 release.</ref>
