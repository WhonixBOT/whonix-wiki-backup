= End-of-life Software =

Users should not run software that has reached end-of-life status, because developers will not fix existing defects, bugs or vulnerabilities, posing serious security risks.

A recent example is [https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4203 VLC in Debian jessie], which reached end-of-life status in May, 2018. Therefore, a different media player should be used until Whonix 14 is released, because VLC in jessie has current unpatched security vulnerabilities.

= Installing Additional Software =
