== Frozen Packages ==
{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = As {{project name}} is based on the stable Debian distribution, software is normally [https://release.debian.org/buster/freeze_policy.html "frozen" to the stable Debian version] at the [https://www.debian.org/releases/ point of each major Debian release]. The Debian packages page notes: <ref>
https://www.debian.org/distrib/packages
</ref>

<blockquote>This is the latest official release of the Debian distribution. This is stable and well tested software, which changes only if major security or usability fixes are incorporated.</blockquote>
}}

As a distribution, Debian's compilation of software is mostly acquired from "upstream" third parties (the original software vendors). Debian has embraced the principle of software stability which means each major release "freezes" software versions. As a result the stable distribution software is not regularly updated except for critical security fixes. This is called "security support" and only leads to minimal changes across the entire distribution. The intent is to improve stability by reducing the overall number of system changes. 

The frozen packages policy means the versions of software installed from Debian package sources will not usually change when a newer release is made available by upstream. <ref>

== Standard Upgrade vs Release Upgrade ==

This procedure is for standard ("everyday") upgrading of {{non_q_project_name_short}} and will not perform a [[Release Upgrade]].

{{Release Upgrade}}

It is recommended to first complete a [[#Standard_Upgrade_Steps|standard upgrade]] before applying a release upgrade.

== Upgrade vs Image Re-Installation ==

The [[#Standard_Upgrade_Steps|standard ("everyday") upgrade]] procedure for {{non_q_project_name_short}} is more convenient than a complete re-installation of {{project name}} images because all VM settings and user data are persistent. Backups are possible using VM clones and/or snapshots.

In comparison, a complete re-installation of {{project name}} images requires {{project name}} to be completely removed and then re-installed, similar to newcomers installing the platform for the first time. Obviously all VM settings and data are lost during this procedure. If this is necessary, follow these steps:
* [[Qubes|Qubes-Whonix]]: [[Qubes/Uninstall|uninstall Qubes-Whonix]] and then [[Qubes/Uninstall|install Qubes-Whonix]].
* [[Non-Qubes-Whonix]]: remove any {{project name}} VMs and then re-install them.

Developers periodically announce a newer {{project name}} [[Point Release]] or major release. To stay informed about releases, see: [[Stay Tuned|Following {{project name}} Developments]]. It is recommended to subscribe to relevant news channels for this purpose.

Standard upgrades are generally easier, but image re-installation can completely avoid [[Dev/Stateless|technical issues]] that might emerge during upgrades.

== apt-get Hash Sum mismatch ==
A hash sum mismatch can look like this:

<pre>
W: Failed to fetch http://deb.debian.org/debian/dists/stable/main/i18n/Translation-enIndex  Hash Sum mismatch
</pre>

This might happen due to Tor and/or network unreliability issues.

If this warning message is transient, it can be safely ignored. Otherwise, try one of the fixes below. [[Tor_Controller#Nyx|Change your Tor circuit]] and/or try again later.

If this warning message persists, deleting the package lists should solve it. 

To delete the package lists, run:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
}}

To make sure everything works like it should, update your package lists and upgrade your distribution. Chances are that your previous update/upgrade attempts have failed due to the mismatch.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
}}
