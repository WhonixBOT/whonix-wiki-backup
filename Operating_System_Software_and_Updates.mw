= End-of-life Software =

Users should not run software that has reached end-of-life status, because developers will not fix existing defects, bugs or vulnerabilities, posing serious security risks.

A recent example was [https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4203 VLC in Debian jessie], which reached end-of-life status in May, 2018. In that case, Whonix 13 users who did not utilize a different media player were at risk, because VLC in jessie has unpatched security vulnerabilities. This VLC vulnerability not apply to the current stable Whonix {{VersionShort}} release.

= Installing Additional Software =

== Non-functional Onion Services ==

Occasionally the Debian onion servers are non-functional, meaning users cannot complete updates automatically. When this problem occurs, an error message similar to the following appears.

<pre>

</pre>

To circumvent this issue until the onion service is re-established, complete the following steps in Whonix-Gateway (<code>whonix-gw-14</code>) and Whonix-Workstation (<code>whonix-ws-14</code>). <ref>If similar problems are experienced with Whonix or Qubes onion services then the same procedure can be used to modify the <code>whonix.list</code> and <code>qubes-r4.list</code> files, respectively.</ref> <ref>http://forums.dds6qkxpwdeubwucdiaord2xgbbeyds25rbsgr73tbfpqpt4a6vjwsyd.onion/t/errors-updating-september-2018/6028</ref>

'''1.''' Open Debian sources.list in an editor.

{{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list
}}

'''2.''' Comment (#) the lines with the .onion address and uncomment the lines with the clearnet address. 

The first two code blocks should look like this. Note: only blocks shown need to be edited.

<pre>
#deb tor+http://sgvtcaew4bxjd7ln.onion stretch/updates main contrib non-free
deb http://security.debian.org stretch/updates main contrib non-free

#deb tor+http://vwakviie2ienjx6t.onion/debian stretch main contrib non-free
deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian stretch main contrib non-free
</pre>

Save and exit.

'''3.''' Confirm the clearnet repositories are functional.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}

'''4.''' Revert

It is recommended that these changes are reverted at a later time, so users benefit from the security advantages of onion repositories.

'''5.''' Revert

Apply [[#Updates]].
