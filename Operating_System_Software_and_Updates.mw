<blockquote>
This is the latest official release of the Debian distribution. This is stable and well tested software, which changes only if major security or usability fixes are incorporated.
</blockquote>

Debian is a distribution. A compilation of software. Debian acquires most software from third parties, the original vendors of the software. Also called "upstream". Debian has a concept of stabilization of software and stable releases. When Debian creates a stable release, it "freezes" software versions. Debian will not update the software in the stable distribution except for the purpose of fixing security issues. In that case, Debian will only do minimal changes to fix security issues. This is also called "security support". The goal of this process is to ensure a stable system where the behavior of the system changes as little as possible.

Therefore, do not expect that versions of installed software from Debian package sources will change whenever a newer release is made available by upstream (the original vendor of the software). <ref>

* '''[[Qubes|Qubes {{project_name}}]]:''' Follow the [[Qubes/Update|{{q_project_name}} Update Guide]].
* '''All other {{project name}} OS builds:''' Follow the update instructions below.

== Standard Upgrade vs Release Upgrade ==

This procedure is for standard ("everyday") upgrading of {{non_q_project_name_short}} and will not perform a [[Release Upgrade]].

{{Release Upgrade}}

Before applying a release upgrade, it is useful to first complete a standard upgrade as documented below.

== Upgrade vs Image Re-Installation ==
The procedure is for standard ("everyday") upgrading of {{non_q_project_name_short}} is more convenient than a complete re-installation of {{project name}} images since all settings and user data inside the VM is easily persistent. Backups are possible using VM clones and/or snapshots.

Complete re-installation of {{project name}} images means deleting all of {{project name}} and re-installing {{project name}} as if you are a first time user of {{project name}}.

In case of [[Qubes-Whonix]] this means [[Qubes/Uninstall|uninstall Qubes-Whonix]] and then [[Qubes/Uninstall|install Qubes-Whonix]].

In case of [[Non-Qubes-Whonix]] this means to remove any {{project name}} VMs and to install these again.

At some points in time, a newer {{project name}} [[Point Release]] or a newer {{project name}} major release is available. You can learn about such new releases by [[Stay Tuned|Following {{project name}} Developments]], which subscribing to is absolutely crucial anyhow.

In case both is available, standard upgrade and image re-installation, which one is better?

While standard upgrades are easier, image re-installation is less likely to suffer from any upgrading issues. This is due to [[Dev/Stateless|technical issues]].

=== apt-get Hash Sum mismatch ===
If you get a hash sum mismatch when updating through sudo apt-get update then deleting the package lists should solve it. A hash sum mismatch can look like:

<pre>
W: Failed to fetch http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/dists/testing/contrib/i18n/Translation-enIndex  Hash Sum mismatch
</pre>

To delete the package lists, run:

<pre>
sudo rm -fR /var/lib/apt/lists/*
</pre>

To make sure everything works like it should, update your package lists and upgrade your distro. Chances are that your previous update/upgrade attempts have failed due to the mismatch.

<pre>
sudo apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade
</pre>
