= Introduction =
[http://yacy.net YaCy] is a p2p, censorship resistant libre search engine. It can be configured to crawl the internet and private intranets.<ref>https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-yacy-as-an-alternative-search-engine-or-site-search-tool</ref>

{{Third Party Repository}}

Its simple to install and run YaCy. Follow the steps on the [http://www.yacy-websuche.de/wiki/index.php/En:DebianInstall official page] to add the repository and fetch the needed packages.

A proxy exception in TBB must be configured to interact with YaCy. TBB blocks communication with  localhost to mitigate some fingerprinting attacks<ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T291#5252</ref>. Note that this exception has [[Tor_Browser#Local_Connections|fingerprinting implications]] in event of a website actively abusing JavaScript, but its still much safer than using another browser <ref>https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/10419#comment:37</ref>. To mitigate the risks completely, you are advised to disable scripts globally in NoScript and permit them only when really necessary - a good practice anyhow.

To add an exception click on:
<pre>
 the green onion icon in your toolbar -> Preferences... -> Use custom proxy settings -> No Proxies for: AND there enter "127.0.0.1". Then, click on "OK"
</pre>

To integrate YaCy with TorBrowser you can install the official [https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/yacybar-6344/ YaCyBar add-on] from Mozilla. N.B. This option is not possible right now because the add-on code needs a revamp.
