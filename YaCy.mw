= Introduction =
[http://yacy.net YaCy] is a p2p, censorship resistant Libre search engine. It can be configured to crawl the Internet and private intranets. <ref>https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-yacy-as-an-alternative-search-engine-or-site-search-tool</ref>

= How-to: =
== Install ==
{{Third Party Repository}}


'''1.''' Check the YaCy key fingerprint.

Before adding the repository, <ref>http://debian.yacy.net/</ref> <ref>http://www.yacy-websuche.de/wiki/index.php/En:DebianInstall</ref> fetch the key and verify <ref>http://debian.yacy.net/yacy_orbiter_key.asc</ref> the fingerprint. <u>Always check the fingerprint for yourself</u>.

'''2.''' Add YaCy apt signing key.

{{apt-key
|filename=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/yacy-pubkey.gpg
|fingerprint=8BD752501CB62448A30EA3EA1F968B3903D886E7
}}

'''3.''' Add YaCy repository.

{{CodeSelect|code=
echo 'deb http://debian.yacy.net ./' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yacy.list 
}}

{{Update}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}

'''4.''' Install <code>openjdk-7-jre-headless</code> and <code>yacy</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre-headless yacy
}}

To read more on managing YaCy, consult the [http://www.yacy-websuche.de/wiki/index.php/En:DebianInstall#Important_File_Locations official documentation]. 

== Tor Browser Proxy Exception ==

A proxy exception must be configured in Tor Browser to interact with YaCy. Tor Browser blocks communication with localhost to mitigate some fingerprinting attacks. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T291#5252</ref> Note that this exception has [[Tor_Browser#Local_Connections|fingerprinting implications]] in the event a website actively abuses JavaScript, but it is still far safer than using another browser. <ref>https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/10419#comment:37</ref> To completely mitigate the risk, it is advised to disable scripts globally with the NoScript extension and only permit JavaScript when absolutely necessary; a sensible anonymity practice.

{{Template:TBB_localhost}}

== Usage ==

To access the WebUI, copy <code>127.0.0.1:8090</code> into the URL bar of [[Tor Browser]] and press <code>Enter</code>.

Note: YaCy cannot be integrated with Tor Browser because the official [https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/yacybar-6344/ YaCyBar add-on] from Mozilla is incompatible with Firefox Quantum and was last updated in 2011. Unless the add-on code is revamped, this option will remain impossible at present.

= Development =
SOCKS proxy support is very unlikely in the near-medium term, as the relevant developer ticket has not been updated since 2013, see: http://mantis.tokeek.de/view.php?id=219
