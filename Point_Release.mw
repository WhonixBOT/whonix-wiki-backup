A point release is not a separate, new version of {{project_name}}. Instead, it is a re-release of {{project name}} which is inclusive of all updates up to a certain point.

Installing any version of {{project name}} {{VersionShort}} and fully updating it leads to a system which is ([[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates#Update_vs_Image_Re-Installation|mostly]]) identical to installing a {{project name}} point release.

If the {{project name}} installation is [[Update|updated]], no further action is required.

Regardless of the current installed version of {{project_name}}, if users wish to install (or reinstall) {{project name}} for any reason, then the point release is a convenient and more secure method, since it bundles all {{project name}} updates that are available at that specific time. <ref>
