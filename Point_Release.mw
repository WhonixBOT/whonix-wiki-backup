}}

A point release is not separate, new version of Whonix.

It is a re-release of Whonix inclusive of all updates up to a certain point.

Installing any version of Whonix {{VersionShort}} and fully updating it results in the same system as installing a Whonix point release.

If you [[Update|updated]] your Whonix installation, no further action is required.

Regardless of your current installed version of Whonix, if you wish to install (or reinstall) Whonix for any reason, then the point release will make this more convenient and secure, since it bundles all Whonix updates to date.
