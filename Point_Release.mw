TODO: adapt for Whonix

What is a point release?
------------------------

A point release does not designate a separate, new version of Qubes OS.
Rather, it designates its respective major or minor release (in this
case, 4.0) inclusive of all updates up to a certain point. Installing
Qubes 4.0 and fully updating it results in the same system as installing
Qubes 4.0.1.


What should I do?
-----------------

If you're currently using an up-to-date Qubes 4.0 installation, then
your system is already equivalent to a Qubes 4.0.1 installation. No
action is needed.

Regardless of your current OS, if you wish to install (or reinstall)
Qubes 4.0 for any reason, then the 4.0.1 ISO will make this more
convenient and secure, since it bundles all Qubes 4.0 updates to date.
It will be especially helpful for users whose hardware is too new to be
compatible with the original Qubes 4.0 installer.


Release candidate planning
--------------------------

We expect that there will be a second release candidate (4.0.1-rc2)
following this one (4.0.1-rc1). The second release candidate will
include a fix for the Nautilus bug reported in #4460 [1] along with any
other available fixes for bugs reported against this release candidate.
As usual, you can help by reporting any bugs you encounter. [2]
