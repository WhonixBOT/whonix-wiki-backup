}}

A point release is not a separate, new version of Whonix. Instead, it is a re-release of Whonix which is inclusive of all updates up to a certain point.

Installing any version of Whonix {{VersionShort}} and fully updating it leads to a system which is identical to installing a Whonix point release.

If the Whonix installation is [[Update|updated]], no further action is required.

Regardless of the current installed version of Whonix, if users wish to install (or reinstall) Whonix for any reason, then the point release is a convenient and more secure method, since it bundles all Whonix updates that are available at that specific time. <ref>
