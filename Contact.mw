I would appreciate if you could send me your draft before publishing articles about Whonix. This is not a request. It's an offer. I would proofread it, state where I think something is incorrect and add sources to my claims. I dislike to pressure press. You are free to write what you want. I feel free to post my standpoint in public if I feel otherwise about something.

== Social Media ==
There are some [[Official Whonix Online Profiles | Whonix Social Media Profiles]], but please don't rely on them for getting Whonix News and please don't use them to contact Whonix developers.

If you don't get into trouble, by letting others to know, that you like or use Whonix, feel free to follow or like those profiles (with your anonymous account) as a little way to [[Contribute]].
