== Social Media ==

There are a few [[Official Whonix Online Profiles | Whonix Social Media Profiles]], but they should not be relied upon for the latest Whonix news. In addition, Whonix developers should be directly contacted by email and not via social media.

Some users may wish to follow or like the available Whonix profiles (with an anonymous account). This applies if it is safe to talk about using the Whonix platform and you want to share your experience with others. This is also a small way to [[Contribute|contribute]] to the project.
