I would appreciate if you could send me your draft before publishing articles about Whonix. This is not a request. It's an offer. I would proofread it, state where I think something is incorrect and add sources to my claims. I dislike to pressure press. You are free to write what you want. I feel free to post my standpoint in public if I feel otherwise about something.
