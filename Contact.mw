Free as in Price as well as in Freedom. ([[Why_{{Project name short}}_is_Freedom_Software|Why?]]) Therefore as many commuications as possible should happen in public for transparency.

== Social Media ==

There are a few [[Official {{project name short}} Online Profiles|{{project name}} Social Media Profiles]], but they should not be relied upon for the latest {{project name}} news. See [[Stay Tuned]] for reliable ways of following {{project name}} news.

In addition, when appropriate {{project name}} developers should be directly contacted by email and not via social media as these are likely to get unnoticed.

Some users may wish to follow or like the available {{project name}} profiles (with an anonymous account). This applies if it is safe to talk about using the {{project name}} platform and you want to share your experience with others. This is also a small way to [[Contribute|contribute]] to the project.
