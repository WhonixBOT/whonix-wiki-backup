For VirtualBox there is also an alternate way to set the disks to read-only.
This option is the official way for setting VM's to read-only in VirtualBox. However, it is a bit more complex to setup. This option will also only work with the <code>grub-live</code> package!

First read the footnote below. <ref>VirtualBox implements hard disk write protection differently. If an immutable virtual machine is booted, VirtualBox will always create a snapshot where data is written. After shutting down and booting the VM again (a soft reboot is inadequate) the old snapshot will be deleted and a new one created. The consequence is that data will not persist in the VM, even if Live-mode is not selected. However, since the data is written to the hard disk of the host (instead of memory), it is easily recovered. Therefore, it is necessary to select Live-mode to be safe. A snapshot file is still created, but it will not store any altered content from the VM. </ref>

===== Install grub-live =====

Create a snapshot of your VM.

Alternatively backup the <code>/boot</code> folder.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo cp -a /boot /boot.back
}}

[[Update]] the package lists.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}

Upgrade the system.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
}}

Install the <code>grub-live</code> package.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install grub-live
}}

Following reboot, a second boot entry called "Whonix Live-mode" will be visible. Simply press <code>Enter</code> to boot the live system and use it as normal.

To make a disk on [[VirtualBox]] immutable / read-only, follow these steps:

# Power off the VM
# In the VirtualBox main window, navigate to: <code>File</code> -> <code>Virtual Media Manager</code>.
# Select the disk to write protect and release it.
# Click on <code>Modify</code> -> <code>set it to Immutable</code>. 
# In the VirtualBox main window, navigate to the settings of the VM. 
# Under storage, select the top controller and add the existing hard disk there.

The user can now boot the VM and select Live-mode.

To revert these changes:

# Power off the VM
# Navigate to: <code>File</code> -> <code>Virtual Media Manager</code>. 
# Select the disk. It will now have a snapshot (~12.5 MB) attached to it. 
# Release the snapshot and delete it. 
# Click on <code>Modify</code> and set the hard disk to normal.
# In the VirtualBox main window, navigate to the settings of the VM. 
# Under storage, select the top controller and add the existing hard disk there.
