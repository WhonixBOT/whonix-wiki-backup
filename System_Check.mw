This the same for any Linux distribution. Unspecific to {{project name}}.

There are no automated tools which have sufficient usability to be actually useful for end users. Not generating more questions, confusion than gain.

For {{Whonix}} there is [[whonixcheck]]. For {{Kicksecure}}, a port might be created securitycheck or so.

But even if such system check tools exist, there is also the question how much coverage these tools implement. An all-encompassing automated testing suite of all functionality, all security features is far from being implementing.

There are some certification / audit tools but not usable for users. See [[Dev/certification]].

Realistically, users can only [[Trust]] that packages work as described and intended, develop skills to audit that for themselves and/or pay someone to do that for them.
