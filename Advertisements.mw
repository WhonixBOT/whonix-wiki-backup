About Advertisements on the {{project name}} Website
}}

Readers may have noticed that each documentation chapter has several advertisements in the footer. To remove all doubt, advertisements do <u>not</u>:

* result in monetary compensation for the {{project name}} project;
* influence the direction of {{project name}} development; or
* lead to changes in {{project name}} software or website choices (apart from the advertisement itself).

The present list of advertisements includes:

* <u>Evolution Host</u>: provides system administration advice for the <code>{{project clearnet}}</code> website.
* <u>Fosshost</u>: <code>fosshost.org</code> is a non-profit organization that provides hosting services to the open source community. <ref>Their website notes: <blockquote>The project operates free hosting services for the open source community. The infrastructure is donated by our hosting sponsors and is managed by a group of highly talented volunteers.</blockquote></ref> Many projects benefit from their services including GNOME, KDE, Debian, and FSFE. Fosshost provides a stage server for [[Kicksecure]]. <ref>
For the development of the <code>kicksecure.com</code> website. At the time of writing, this is not yet public.
</ref>
* <u>Jobble</u>: link exchange. It shows advertisements for {{project name}} for related searches.
* <u>Search engines (YaCy | Qwant | ecosia | MetaGer | peekier)</u>: This is voluntary listing by {{project name}} and no discussion has occurred with any of these services. Also see [https://forums.whonix.org/t/local-browser-homepage-for-tor-browser-in-whonix/347/101 this forum post].

Any future changes will be documented on this page.
