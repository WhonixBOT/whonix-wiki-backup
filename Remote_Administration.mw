= Warning = 

Remote administration of any system should be considered a potential anonymity hazard, since it is not under the user's physical protection and could be compromised. Although counterintuitive, it is necessary to follow all relevant recommendations in the [[Surfing Posting Blogging]] chapter to stay safe:

* Beware of [[Surfing_Posting_Blogging#Keystroke_Fingerprinting|Keystroke]] and [[Surfing_Posting_Blogging#Mouse_Fingerprinting|Mouse Fingerprinting]].
* Beware of [[Surfing_Posting_Blogging#Stylometry|Stylometry]].
* Beware of difficulties in paying anonymously, see [[Money]].
