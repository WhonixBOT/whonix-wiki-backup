== Warning ==

Remote administration of any system should be considered a potential anonymity hazard, since it is not under the user's physical protection and could be compromised. All activities, all programs, everything should be assumed to be monitored by the host of the server (VPS, dedicated server, etc.).

Although counter-intuitive, it is necessary to follow all relevant recommendations in the [[Surfing Posting Blogging]] chapter to stay safe:

* Beware of [[Surfing_Posting_Blogging#Keystroke_Fingerprinting|Keystroke]] and [[Surfing_Posting_Blogging#Mouse_Fingerprinting|Mouse Fingerprinting]].
* Beware of [[Surfing_Posting_Blogging#Stylometry|Stylometry]].
* Beware of difficulties in paying anonymously, see [[Money]].

At a minimum, check the connection is encrypted / authenticated, because [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing Virtual Network Computing (VNC)] by default is unencrypted / unauthenticated. Possible methods:

* Perhaps by tunneling VNC through [[SSH]];
* Running VNC through a [[Onion Services|Tor Onion Service]];
* Using both SSH and an Onion Service, for stronger encryption and authentication; or
* Onion Services Authentication.

== UDP ==

It is suggested to utilize software that does not require the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), for the following reason.

It is possible to remotely administer any operating system with GNU/Linux by using the [https://remmina.org/ Remmina] desktop client. Remmina supports multiple network protocols, including RDP, VNC, SPICE, NX, XDMCP, SSH and EXEC. For an overview of Remmina features, see [https://remmina.org/remmina-features/ here].

Note there are two separate Debian packages:

* <code>remmina</code>: the main GTK+ application.
* <code>remmina-plugins</code>: a set of plugins to support various network protocols.
