= Warning = 
Remote administration of any system should be considered a potential anonymity hazard, since it is not under the user's physical protection and could be compromised. Although counterintuitive, it is necessary to follow all relevant recommendations in the [[Surfing Posting Blogging]] chapter to stay safe:

* Beware of [[Surfing_Posting_Blogging#Keystroke_Fingerprinting|Keystroke]] and [[Surfing_Posting_Blogging#Mouse_Fingerprinting|Mouse Fingerprinting]].
* Beware of [[Surfing_Posting_Blogging#Stylometry|Stylometry]].
* Beware of difficulties in paying anonymously, see [[Money]].

At a minimum, check the connection is encrypted / authenticated, because VNC by default is unencrypted / unauthenticated. Possible methods:

* Perhaps by tunneling VNC through [[SSH]]; or
* Running VNC through a [[Onion Services|Tor Onion Service]]; or
* Using both SSH and an Onion Service, for stronger encryption and authentication.
* Onion Services Authentication

You might be better off using something that does not require UDP, because...

It is possible to remotely administer any operating system with GNU/Linux by using the [https://remmina.org/ Remmina] desktop client. Remmina supports multiple network protocols, including RDP, VNC, SPICE, NX, XDMCP, SSH and EXEC. 

Note there are two separate Debian packages:

* <code>remmina</code>: the main GTK+ application.
* <code>remmina-plugins</code>: a set of plugins to support various network protocols.
