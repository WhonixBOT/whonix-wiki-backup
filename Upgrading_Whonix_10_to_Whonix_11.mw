|description=How to Upgrade from Whonix 10.x to Whonix 11.x
}}

= Before you start =
== If you want to upgrade Whonix-Gateway as well as Whonix-Workstation ==
1. Backup your data. (Ideally have a copy of your VM, so you can try again.) <br />
2. Consider running the optional [[#Sanity Tests]]. <br />
3. Upgrade Whonix-Workstation. <br />
4. Power off Whonix-Workstation. <br />
5. Upgrade Whonix-Gatway. <br />
6. Restart Whonix-Gateway. <br />
7. Restart Whonix-Workstation <br />

== If you only want to upgrade Whonix-Workstation ==
1. Backup your data. (Ideally have a copy of your VM, so you can try again.) <br />
2. Consider running the optional [[#Sanity Tests]]. <br />
3. Upgrade Whonix-Workstation. <br />
4. Power off Whonix-Workstation. <br />
5. [[Download|Get]] Whonix-Gateway. <br />
6. Start Whonix-Gateway. <br />
7. Start Whonix-Workstation <br />

You can ignore the following errors.

= Upgrading =
'''[[Download|Downloading]] a new Whonix-Gateway / Whonix-Workstation will be probably easier than applying the following instructions for upgrading.'''

Backups are important as noted in above chapter [[#Before you start]]. Especially for [[Qubes]] users. <ref>Qubes has some more issues with distribution upgrades.</ref>

Consider doing the [[#Sanity Tests]] described above. They'll check if your system is affected by obvious grave issues, that you must fix before attempting to upgrade. If your package manager is broken, for example because you mixed packages from Debian stable with packages from Debian testing, then the upgrade may fail in the middle leaving your system in a difficult to resolve situation.

Consider keeping the full terminal (Konsole) log. Even if everything apparently worked, there might be issues after reboot. In case of a bug report in the forums you would be asked to share the upgrading log so the issue can be investigated.

Make sure you read [[#Known Issues]] above.

Become root.

<pre>
sudo su
</pre>

Do a usual [[Security_Guide#Updates|upgrade]] of your system's packages from Debian.

For [[Qubes]] users, before you proceed, it is strongly recommended that you apply the above [[#Qubes Pre Fixup]].

Enable {{project name}} {{Code2|jessie}} repository. Don't use the {{Code2|testers}} repository just yet. [Wait for new information.]

<pre>
whonix_repository --enable --codename jessie

Now we have to edit a few apt sources. The following three {{Code2|sed}} commands will do that for you. (But if you cannot or are not comfortable with using copy and paste, and you know what you are doing, you could also manually open an editor and make the described changes.)

Switch Debian sources from {{Code2|wheezy}} to {{Code2|jessie}} in {{Code2|/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list}}.

<pre>
sed -i "s/wheezy/jessie/g" /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list
</pre>

Switch Torproject sources from {{Code2|wheezy}} to {{Code2|jessie}} in {{Code2|/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list}}.

<pre>
sed -i "s/wheezy/jessie/g" /etc/apt/sources.list.d/torproject.list
</pre>

As a [[Qubes]] user, note that upgrades are currently only possible using Qubes' testing repository. Otherwise you run into grave issues. <ref name=qubes-grave-issues /> Switch Qubes' sources from {{Code2|wheezy}} to {{Code2|jessie-testing}} in {{Code2|/etc/apt/sources.list.d/qubes-r3.list}}. (Non-Qubes users should skip Qubes specific steps.) <ref>
Once the fixed packages migrate into stable we can drop the "-testing".
<pre>
sed -i "s/wheezy/jessie/g" /etc/apt/sources.list.d/qubes-r3.list
</pre>
</ref> One [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/1095 the related bug] has been fixed, consider removing the "-testing" from /etc/apt/sources.list.d/qubes-r3.list.

<pre>
sed -i "s/wheezy/jessie-testing/g" /etc/apt/sources.list.d/qubes-r3.list
</pre>

As a [[Qubes]] user, remove the {{Code2|wheezy-backports}} repository from {{Code2|/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list}}. <ref>
The following line.

<pre>
deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ wheezy-backports main
</pre>

Needs to be removed from {{Code2|/etc/apt/sources.list}} because fortunately, Qubes no longer needs it.
</ref>

<pre>
sed -i "s#deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ wheezy-backports main##g" /etc/apt/sources.list
</pre>

Make the upgrade process less interactive. Optional. (Mostly Qubes specific unless you installed apt-listchanges.)

<pre>
export APT_LISTCHANGES_FRONTEND=text
</pre>

Enable extensive debugging so reporting eventual bugs becomes easier.

<pre>
export DEBDEBUG=1
</pre>

Set environment variable TORSOCKS_LOG_LEVEL=1 to reduce unnecessary torsocks warnings. <ref>
Disable torsocks warning spam such as.<br />
[May 20 11:45:27] WARNING torsocks[2645]: [syscall] Unsupported syscall number 224. Denying the call (in tsocks_syscall() at syscall.c:165)<br />
https://phabricator.whonix.org/T317
</ref>
<pre>
export TORSOCKS_LOG_LEVEL=1
</pre>

Update your package lists.

<pre>
apt-get update
</pre>

Let's first upgrade torsocks and uwt, so we see fewer torsocks warning later on. <ref>Due to transition from torsocks 1.x to torsocks 2.x.</ref>
<pre>
apt-get install torsocks uwt
</pre>

Qubes specific fix.

<pre>
localedef -f UTF-8 -i en_US -c en_US.UTF-8
</pre>

Qubes specific fix.

<pre>
update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
</pre>

Upgrade.

<pre>
apt-get dist-upgrade || apt-get -f install || apt-get dist-upgrade
</pre>

Make sure the packages ntp, ntpdate and chrony are not installed. Trying to remove them is enough. Specifically important for Qubes users.<ref>https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/1102</ref>

<pre>
apt-get purge ntp ntpdate chrony
</pre>

If you are not a user of KVM, you can optionally remove the spice-vdagent package. KVM users are probably better of keeping it.

<pre>
apt-get purge spice-vdagent
</pre>

Qubes only. Whonix-Gateway only. Move old qubes-whonix-control-port-filter-python.service out of the way.

<pre>
sudo mv /etc/systemd/system/qubes-whonix-control-port-filter-python.service ~/
</pre>

Qubes only. Whonix-Gateway only. Move old /etc/init.d/control-port-filter-python out of the way.

<pre>
sudo mv /etc/init.d/control-port-filter-python ~/
</pre>

Qubes only. Whonix-Gateway only. Enable control-port-filter-python.

<pre>
sudo systemctl enable control-port-filter-python
</pre>

Qubes only. Whonix-Workstation only. Move old /etc/tmpfiles.d/tor.conf out of the way. <ref>Otherwise systemd service systemd-tmpfiles-setup would enter a failed state.</ref>

<pre>
sudo mv /etc/tmpfiles.d/tor.conf ~/
</pre>

It is recommended to have the {{Code2|whonix-gateway}} / {{Code2|whonix-workstation}} package installed to make sure nothing is broken. (If you like to uninstall it later as per [[{{project name short}} Debian Packages]], you're free to do so. Still, it is recommended to re-install it before removal to make sure you're as close to official package selection as possible.)

If you are upgrading Whonix-Gateway...

<pre>
apt-get install whonix-gateway
</pre>

If you are upgrading Whonix-Workstation...
<pre>
apt-get install whonix-workstation
</pre>

Get rid of old packages.

<pre>
apt-get autoremove
</pre>

Optional: Users of [[VirtualBox]], [[KVM]] and [[Physical Isolation]] can optionally consider installation of the [https://github.com/Whonix/grub-screen-resolution grub-screen-resolution] package, which would set resolution to 1024x768 during boot. <ref>https://github.com/Whonix/grub-screen-resolution/blob/master/etc/default/grub.d/30_screen_resolution.cfg</ref> (Recommended.)

<pre>
apt-get install grub-screen-resolution
</pre>

Optional: Users of VirtualBox, KVM and Physical Isolation can optionally consider installation of the [https://github.com/Whonix/grub-output-verbose grub-output-verbose] package, which would show more verbose output during boot. For better usability, so it doesn't look like boot hangs on slow systems and to ease debugging in case of issues. <ref>https://github.com/Whonix/grub-output-verbose/blob/master/etc/default/grub.d/30_output_verbose.cfg</ref> (Recommended.)

<pre>
apt-get install grub-output-verbose
</pre>

Qubes only! Get rid of {{project name}} autostart of Whonix Setup Wizard.
<pre>
sudo mv /etc/xdg/autostart/whonix-setup-wizard.desktop ~/
</pre>

Restore original {{Code2|/etc/default/grub}}. <ref>The grub-enable-apparmor package no longer modifies that file. Now implemented using {{Code2|/etc/default/grub.d}}. See also: https://phabricator.whonix.org/T25</ref>

<pre>
sudo cp /etc/default/grub.anondist-orig /etc/default/grub
</pre>

Update grub. ([[Qubes]] users can skip this.)

<pre>
update-grub
</pre>

Consider applying the [[#Grub Fix]] now or after reboot.

Remember to store the terminal (Konsole) log. (File -> Save Output As)

Reboot required.

<pre>
reboot
</pre>

= Grub Fix =
Applying this fix is recommended after upgrading from Whonix 10 to Whonix 11.

Useful if you saw the the error shown on the following screenshot after boot.

[[File:grub_error_file_not_found_issue.png|400px]]

Fortunately, this fix is not critical. The system is still bootable. To have it bootable also in future it is a good idea to fix this.

Recommended for users of [[VirtualBox]] and [[KVM]]. Not required for users of [[Qubes]], because it is not yet using grub. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T353#5523</ref> Maybe not required for users of [[Physical Isolation]].

* [[VirtualBox]] users: <code>sudo grub-install /dev/sda ; echo $?</code>
* [[KVM]] users: <code>sudo grub-install /dev/vda ; echo $?</code>
* [[Qubes]] users: Not required.
* [[Physical Isolation]] users: Probably not required.

Expected output.
