= {{project_name}} Platform Goals =
Developers believe that everyone has the right to private and secure browsing, communications, and hosting of services on the Internet. The {{project_name}} platform has been expressly created to achieve these intended goals. As outlined on the [[Main_Page|Main Page]], the primary user groups are:

* People who value privacy as a fundamental right.
* Average computer users in repressed or censored environments.
* Investigators and whistle-blowers.
* Researchers, government officials and business-people.
* Journalists.
* Political activists.

If there is any doubt, {{project_name}} was never designed to hide users who engage in criminal/unlawful acts.
