= {{project_name}} Platform Goals =
Developers believe that everyone has the right to private and secure browsing, communications, and hosting of services on the Internet. The {{project_name}} platform has been expressly created to achieve these intended goals. As outlined on the [[Main_Page|Main Page]], the primary user groups are:

* People who value privacy as a fundamental right.
* Average computer users in repressed or censored environments.
* Investigators and whistle-blowers.
* Researchers, government officials and business-people.
* Journalists.
* Political activists.

If there is any doubt, {{project_name}} was never designed to hide users who engage in criminal/unlawful acts.

= Whonix Website and Chat Goals =

<u>Reminder</u>: The primary forum aims include: education, fostering innovation and cooperation, resolution of {{project_name}} problems, further improvement of {{project_name}} security and privacy for all users, and assistance to individuals so they can safely achieve their (legal) goals.

Before engaging in the forums or requesting assistance, first thoroughly search the {{project_name}} documentation. Many common questions have already been addressed in relevant chapters. See also [[Support]], [[Free Support Principle]], [[Reporting_Bugs|Bug Reports and Software Development]] and [[Reporting_Bugs#Support_Request_Policy|Support Request Policy]].

If suitable information cannot be located, please refer to the following rules before posting. Users who violate these rules may have their accounts suspended or deleted without notice.

= Whonix Website and Chat Non-Purposes =

* [[Limitations_on_Free_Speech_on_{{project_name_short}}_Website|A free speech platform.]]
* Immortalization: the posting of comment(s) does not grant the author a permanent publishing right.

= Whonix Website and Chat Usage Rules =
Do not post topics or information which:

* Violate trademarks or copyright.
* Contain pornographic or violent media or images.
* Are intended to further unlawful/illegal activities.
* Abuse other users, for example:
** Personal attacks that have nothing to do with technological or development discussions.
** Reveal private information of other users.
** Impersonate other users.
** Encourage self-harm or suicide.
* Promote or invite spam. This includes:
** Selling {{project_name}} usernames or other account information.
** Malware/phishing.
** Repeatedly post information unrelated to {{project_name}} and associated activities.
** Duplicating content across sub-forums.
** Purposefully post false or misleading content/links.
** Promote third-party software or services purely for personal benefit.

Users participating in forums, issue tracker or chat must use either a pseudonym and/or their real name. Empty user names such as <code>""</code> or <code></code> are not permitted. <ref>
Reasons:

* The only place where this is currently an issue is the {{project name}} [[Telegram Chat]]. Not using a user name on telegram does not help much to protect one's identity since users have been assigned unique, public visible user id by telegram anyhow - it's just not conveniently accessible.
* Without a user name it is inconvenient to refer to a user or to check their chat history for moderation purposes.
* It also does not help much to protect one's identity by not using a user name since contents of public communications are far more risky due to issues described on the [[Surfing Posting Blogging]] page, especially [[Stylometry]].
* Consider using a randomly generated user name or random hash instead.
* Many years ago the previous forum software used by the {{project name}} allowed anonymous posting without any account. This was unsustainable because it is counter to community building and due to trolling.

Offensive, contentious or disruptive user avatars are prohibited at the discretion of the moderators.

Users who create multiple accounts to sidestep these rules will also be banned. 

This list is inexhaustive. The moderators reserve the right to remove material and ban user accounts which engage in inappropriate or illegal behavior which fall outside of these guidelines.

A ban in {{project name}} chat for minor violations such as unwanted topics does not necessarily extend to a ban in {{project name}} forums. Major violations equal ban everywhere.

If you have any questions or suggested improvements regarding this policy, post in [https://forums.whonix.org/c/organization/9 {{project name}} forums].

= Whonix Website and Chat Unwanted Topics =
{{Banned_Subjects}}

The following topics shall not be discussed:

* Questions that can be resolved as per [[Free_Support_Principle|Free Support Principle]]. This especially includes:
** Discussions on whether pluggable transports or VPNs can or cannot hide Tor. ([https://forums.whonix.org/t/why-you-cant-hide-tor-usage-from-isp/9179/10 reasoning])
** Discussions on whether pluggable transports or VPNs can or cannot improve protections provided by Tor. (Similar reasoning as above.)
** reasons: [[Reporting_Bugs#Policy_Rationale|Policy Rationale]]; [[Limitations_on_Free_Speech_on_Whonix_Website_and_Whonix_Chat#Personal_Liability|legal, liability]]
* Certain topics related to non-freedom software, see [[Policy_On_Nonfreedom_Software|{{project name}} Policy On Non-Freedom Software]].

= Whonix Chat Purposes and Non-Purposes =
The {{project name}} telegram / matrix chat is suitable for the following topics:

* Simple questions / support requests.
* English language only.

The following topics must be directed to [https://forums.whonix.org {{project name}} forums] instead:

* [[Reporting_Bugs|Bug Reports]]
** Reasons:
*** These cannot be analyzed and fixed instantly.
*** Otherwise bug reports are likely getting lost.
* [[Reporting_Bugs#Community_Feedback|Feature Requests]]
** Reasons:
*** It takes time to seriously consider feature requests. Opinions aren't formed instantly.
*** Feature requests posted in the chat will likely soon be forgotten.
* Licensing discussions.
* Organizational discussions.
* [[#Moderation and Conflict Resolution|Policy discussions]].
* [[#Moderation and Conflict Resolution|Moderation and Conflict Resolution]].
* Reasons:
** Avoiding [https://forums.whonix.org/t/law-of-triviality-bikeshed/6739 law of triviality / bikeshed].

Unwanted topics which must be moved elsewhere:

* Debates.
** Examples:
*** Debates about features and security of closed vs Open Source Software are unwelcome.
*** Small talk.
*** Surveys.
*** Fundamental debates on security, anonymity, privacy, philosophy, politics.
** Reason:
*** Avoiding endless, circular, non-productive debates.
