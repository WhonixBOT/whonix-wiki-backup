= Single vs Double Click =

KDE uses single click instead of double click by default. If you want to change that to double click:

<code>
KDE -> Start menu button -> Applications -> Settings -> System Settings ->
input devices -> mouse -> double click -> apply - Done.
</code>

= Use full-screen =

It's advised to work in full-screen. This feature is also inherited from Virtual Box. Press your host key <ref name=vboxhostkey>Virtual Box -> Global Settings -> Input -> Host Key. You can also see the current Host Key in the bottom right corner of Virtual Box.
</ref> and press F. That will activate full-screen. You end up with Whonix (and Debian) default resolution and color depth 1024x768x24. <ref>As per [[Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection]].</ref> To disable it the same key combination can be used.

= Virtual Consoles =

This feature is inherited from Debian GNU/Linux and Virtual Box. It's noted in Readme because not many people are aware of it. The Debian (not Whonix) feature is to press alt + crtl + F1 or F2, F3, etc. for additional text consoles or F7 for graphical console. Because Debian already registered alt + ctrl keys. Instant of alt + ctrl, use the Virtual Box Host Key. <ref name=vboxhostkey /> That means, use Host Key + F1, F2, F7, etc. to do the same inside Virtual Box.

= Shut down the Whonix-Gateway =

To '''shut down''' the gateway simply enter

<pre>sudo poweroff</pre>
