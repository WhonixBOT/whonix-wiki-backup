== Disable Terminal Emulator Banner ==
The following banner appears when a terminal is opened.

</blockquote>

To disable the banner, follow these steps.
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' {{Open_a _product_ws_terminal}}

'''2.''' Run the following command.

{{CodeSelect|code=
cp /etc/skel/.bashrc.whonix-orig ~/.bashrc
}}

The process is now complete.
}}

== Shut Down {{gateway_product_name}} (sys-whonix) ==

To shut down {{gateway_product_name}} (<code>sys-whonix</code>), open a terminal and run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo poweroff
}}

Alternatively, use the menu option:

* [[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]]: <code>Blue Q button</code> &rarr; <code>sys-whonix</code> &rarr; <code>Shutdown</code>
* [[{{non q project name short}}|{{non q project name}}]]: <code>Start</code> &rarr; <code>Leave...</code>

== Virtual Consoles ==
=== On the Host ===
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_console Virtual consoles] is a feature inherited from Debian GNU/Linux which is unfamiliar to many users. The following keyboard shortcuts activate the Debian (not {{project_name}}) feature:

* Text console: Press <code>Alt + Crtl + F1</code>
** Additional text consoles: Press <code>Alt + Crtl + F2</code> or <code>F3</code> and so on.
* Graphical console: Press <code>Alt + Crtl + F7</code>

=== Virtual Machines ===
'''Table:''' ''Virtual Console Activation''

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! scope="col"| '''Platform'''
! scope="col"| '''Steps'''
|-
! scope="row"| KVM
| The desired virtual console key shortcut can be selected under the <code>Send Key</code> option in a VM's graphical window.
|-
! scope="row"| Qubes dom0
| Qubes dom0 inherited the same feature (<code>Alt + Crtl + F1</code>...).
|-
! scope="row"| Qubes VMs
| In order to access VMs in dom0, run: <ref>This is not a real virtual console, but using login.</ref> <code>sudo xl console vm-name</code>. Replace "vm-name" with the name of the actual VM, for example.<br />
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo xl console sys-whonix
}}
|-
! scope="row"| VirtualBox
| The VirtualBox default is <code>Right Ctrl + F1</code>. <ref>
Inside VirtualBox, the <code>Alt + Ctrl</code> keys are already registered by the host operating system.
Host key can be changed using <code>VirtualBox</code> &rarr; <code>Global Settings</code> &rarr; <code>Input</code> &rarr; <code>Host Key</code>.
</ref>

* Text console: Press <code>Right Ctrl + F1 (F2,...)</code> for one or more text consoles. <br />
* Graphical console: Press <code>Host Key + F7</code> for a graphical console inside VirtualBox.
|}

In the Whonix case, the virtual console will show <code>host login:</code>. This can be confusing and has nothing to do with the actual host that Whonix is running on. The string <code>host</code> is retrieved from file <code>/etc/hostname</code> which for privacy reasons is set to <code>host</code> in Whonix. Therefore <u>do not</u> enter your host (the system Whonix is running on) username or host password.

Due to technical limitations, an easier to understand presentation like <code>Whonix username login:</code> or something similar cannot be shown. <ref>
The <code>login</code> program unfortunately does not provide this option.
</ref>

# Enter your username (this is most likely <code>user</code>) and press <code><enter></code>.
# Enter your password and press <code><enter></code>.
{{Default Passwords}}

=== Disable Virtual Console Banner ===

This process is similar to [[#Disable Terminal Emulator Banner|Disable Terminal Emulator Banner]].

1. Open a [[#Virtual Consoles|virtual console]].

2. Run the following command to restore the original bashrc (untested). <ref>Please leave feedback if this step works correctly.</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
cp /etc/skel/.bashrc.whonix-orig ~/.bashrc
}}

<ref>
3. Run the following command.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo unlink /etc/motd
}}
</ref>

The procedure is complete.

== Disable Autologin ==
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo rm /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/whonix.conf
}}

== RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter ==
{{RAM_Adjusted_Desktop_Starter}}

For more information, see [[RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter]].

== Use Full-screen Mode ==
It is recommended to work in full-screen; this feature is also inherited from [[VirtualBox]]. To activate and deactivate full-screen mode, press the VirtualBox Host Key + F. The current Host Key is visible in the bottom right corner of VirtualBox. The VirtualBox default is <code>Right Ctrl + F</code>.

Host key can be changed using <code>VirtualBox</code> &rarr; <code>Global Settings</code> &rarr; <code>Input</code> &rarr; <code>Host Key</code>.

Full-screen mode leads to the {{project name}} (and Debian) default resolution and color depth of <code>1920x1080x24</code>. Having a common value for these identifiers reduces the [[Protocol-Leak-Protection_and_Fingerprinting-Protection#Major_Identifiers|fingerprinting risk]] to the user. Full-screen mode also helps to prevent users from accidentally launching applications on the host (such as a clearnet browser), instead of within {{project_name}}.

{{Anchor|Whonixcheck / Timesync Writing to tty1}}

== Whonixcheck Writing to tty1 ==

[[File:writing to tty1 by adrelanos.png|400px|thumb|[[whonixcheck]] wrote its results to <i>tty1</i>]]
It is difficult to keep users updated with system status information when they are using a terminal instead of a graphical desktop environment. Therefore, [[whonixcheck]] will very occasionally provide status messages, even if the user is logged into the terminal <i>tty1</i> and sees a command prompt. 

This feature can be useful, for example if {{gateway_product_name}} has a customized configuration (even if it was not strictly required) and successful status messages are posted about the system. On the other hand, status message output can be a hindrance, particularly if the user is doing something like editing a configuration file when it appears. If it is necessary to complete activities without interruption, it is recommended to log into a tty other than <i>tty1</i>, for example <i>tty2</i>:

* Default-Download-Version: utilize the VirtualBox Host Key method: <code>Right Ctrl + F2</code>. <ref>The <code>Right Ctrl</code> key is the VirtualBox default.</ref>
* Physical isolation: utilize the standard Debian feature which comes with Debian: <code>Ctrl + Alt + F2</code>.

== XFCE Scaling ==

A number of displays found in high-end laptops and desktops have High Dots Per Inch (HiDPI), providing a high resolution in a relatively small format. High-resolution mode can cause problems with certain software and the following adjustments may be necessary to improve HiDPI presentation in XFCE. <ref name=HiDPI>https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/HiDPI#Xfce</ref>

'''Table:''' ''XFCE Scaling Options''

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! scope="col"| '''Configuration'''
! scope="col"| '''Description'''
|-
! scope="row"| Fonts
| Change the DPI parameter as follows: <ref name=HiDPI /> <br />
* <code>Settings Manager</code> &rarr; <code>Appearance</code> &rarr; <code>Fonts</code> &rarr; <code>DPI</code> &rarr; <code>Increase</code> <br />
For example, it is reported that a value of <code>180</code> or <code>192</code> seems to work well on Retina screens, but trial and error may be necessary to get a more precise number for the relevant display.
|-
! scope="row"| gtk2 Menus and Buttons
| Follow these steps to change the default icon sizes of gtk2 menus, buttons and so on: <ref name=HiDPI /> <br />
* <code>Settings Manager</code> &rarr; <code>Settings Editor</code> &rarr; <code>xsettings</code> &rarr; <code>Gtk</code> &rarr; <code>IconSizes</code> &rarr; in row <code>Value</code> &rarr; add the following line. <br />
{{CodeSelect|code=
gtk-large-toolbar=96,96:gtk-small-toolbar=64,64:gtk-menu=64,64:gtk-dialog=96,96:gtk-button=64,64:gtk-dnd=64,64
}}
Note that the "gtk-dnd" parameter is for the icons during drag'n'drop, while the others are self-evident based on their name. Any value supported by the icon theme can be used. 
|-
! scope="row"| System Tray Icon Size
| Follow these steps to enlarge icons in the system tray: <ref name=HiDPI /> <br />
# <code>Right-click on system tray</code>: aim for empty space / top pixels / bottom pixels, so the the icons are not activated themselves. <br />
# <code>Properties</code> &rarr; <code>Set "Maximum icon size"</code> to <code>32</code>, <code>48</code> or <code>64</code>.
|-
! scope="row"| Task Bar Size
| To change the size of the task bar: <br />
* <code>Right-click on empty space in task bar</code> &rarr; <code>Panel</code> &rarr; <code>Panel Preferences</code> &rarr; <code>Row Size (Pixels)</code> &rarr; <code>move slider</code>
|-
! scope="row"| Window Manager Style
| Xfwm has two hidpi themes: Default-hdpi and Default-xhdpi. Change the theme as follows: <ref name=HiDPI /> <br />
* <code>Settings Manager</code> &rarr; <code>Window Manager</code> &rarr; <code>Style</code> &rarr; <code>Theme</code> &rarr; <code>Default-hdpi</code> or <code>Default-xhdpi</code>
|}

== XFCE Settings Reset ==
Before following these instructions to wipe the whole XFCE settings folder and restore defaults, it is recommended to backup existing XFCE settings.
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Open a [[Desktop#Virtual_Consoles|virtual console]].

'''2.''' Logout from and stop XFCE by halting lightdm.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemct stop lightdm
}}

'''3.''' Trash folder <code>~/.config/xfce4</code>.

'''4.''' Delete the <code>first-boot-skel.done</code> file.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo rm /var/cache/anon-base-files/first-boot-skel.done
}}

'''5.''' Re-add Whonix XFCE configuration files.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo /usr/lib/anon-base-files/first-boot-skel
}}

'''6.''' Restart lightdm to restart XFCE.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl restart lightdm
}}
}}

== Avoid VM Full Screen Mode ==

It is unrecommended to allow [[{{q_project_name_short}}|{{q_project_name}}]] or other VMs to [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/full-screen-mode/ completely "own" the full screen]. Overriding Qubes' GUI virtualization daemon restrictions means the colored decorations drawn by each VM window will not be visible. In this case, a malicious application might not actually release the full screen (while it appears normal), or the full desktop may be emulated so users are tricked into entering sensitive information inside false "trusted" domains. <ref>https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/full-screen-mode/</ref>
