= Single vs Double-click =
Be default, launching desktop icons in KDE uses a single-click, instead of a double-click method. Users can change the default launching behavior to a double-click via the following steps.

<code>KDE</code> -> <code>Start menu button</code> -> <code>Applications</code> -> <code>Settings</code> -> <code>System Settings</code> -> <code>input devices</code> -> <code>mouse</code> -> <code>double click</code> -> <code>apply</code>

Done.

= Show Desktop =
In KDE 4, dashboard view replaces the old "Show Desktop" feature. Press <code>Ctrl + F12</code> to show the dashboard view. This keyboard shortcut can be changed in the system settings.

<code>System Settings</code> -> <code>Shortcuts and Gestures</code> -> <code>Global Keyboard Shortcuts</code> -> <code>KDE component = Plasma Desktop Shell</code> -> <code>Show Dashboard</code>.

For more information about the KDE 4 desktop, please see https://www.kde.org/announcements/4.0/desktop.php

= Use Full-screen Mode =
It is recommended to work in full-screen; this feature is also inherited from [[VirtualBox]]. To activate and deactivate full-screen mode, press the <code>Host Key <ref name=vboxhostkey><code>VirtualBox</code> -> <code>Global Settings</code> -> <code>Input</code> -> <code>Host Key</code>. You can also see the current Host Key in the bottom right corner of VirtualBox.</ref> + F</code>. <ref>The normal VirtualBox default is <code>Right Ctrl + F</code>.</ref>

Full-screen mode leads to the Whonix (and Debian) default resolution and color depth of 1024x768x24. Having a common value for these identifiers reduces the [[Protocol-Leak-Protection_and_Fingerprinting-Protection#Important_identifiers|fingerprinting risk]] to the user.

= Virtual Consoles =
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_console Virtual consoles] is a feature inherited from Debian GNU/Linux. It is noted here because not many users are aware of it. The Debian (not Whonix) feature is activated as follows:

* For a text console: Press <code>Alt + Crtl + F1</code>.
* For additional text consoles: Press <code>Alt + Crtl + F2</code> or <code>F3</code> and so on.
* For a graphical console: Press <code>Alt + Crtl + F7</code>.
<br />
'''Qubes'''

In dom0, run: <code>sudo xl console vm-name</code>. Replace "vm-name" with the name of the actual VM, for example: <code>sudo xl console sys-whonix</code>.

'''KVM'''

The desired virtual console key combination is selected from under the <code>Send Key</code> option in a VM's graphic window.

'''VirtualBox'''

When the user is inside VirtualBox, the <code>Alt + Ctrl</code> keys are already registered by the host operating system.

Instead of the <code>Alt + Ctrl</code> combination, the VirtualBox Host Key<ref name=vboxhostkey /> is used. This means the user should press in combination <code>Host Key + F1 (F2,...)</code> for a text console(s), and <code>Host Key + F7 </code> for a graphical console inside VirtualBox.

= Shut Down the Whonix-Gateway =

To shut down the gateway, in a terminal run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo poweroff
}}

Alternatively, use the menu option. 

<code>Start</code> -> <code>Leave...</code>

= RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter =
{{RAM_Adjusted_Desktop_Starter}}

= Whonixcheck / Timesync Writing to tty1 =
Note: This applies to [[Non-Qubes-Whonix]] only.

[[File:writing to tty1 by adrelanos.png|400px|thumb|[[whonixcheck]] wrote its results to <i>tty1</i>]]
It is difficult to keep users updated with system status information when they are using a terminal instead of a graphical desktop environment. Therefore, the Whonix timesync and whonixcheck applications will very occasionally provide status messages, even if the user is logged into the terminal <i>tty1</i> and sees a command prompt. 

This feature can be useful, for example when the user has configured the Whonix-Gateway to their liking (if this was required at all) and successful status messages are posted about the system. On the other hand, status message output can be a hindrance, particularly if the user is doing something like editing a configuration file when it appears. If the user needs to complete activities without interruption, it is advisable to log into a tty other than <i>tty1</i>, for example <i>tty2</i>:

* Default-Download-Version users can use the VirtualBox Host Key method: <code>Right Ctrl + F2</code>. <ref>The right Ctrl key is the VirtualBox default.</ref>
* Physical isolation users can use the standard feature which comes with Debian: <code>Ctrl + Alt + F2</code>.
