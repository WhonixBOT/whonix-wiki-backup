== Shut Down Whonix-Gateway (sys-whonix) ==

To shut down Whonix-Gateway (<code>sys-whonix</code>), open a terminal and run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo poweroff
}}

Alternatively, use the menu option:

* [[Qubes-Whonix]]: <code>Blue Q button</code> -> <code>sys-whonix</code> -> <code>Shutdown</code>
* [[Non-Qubes-Whonix]]: <code>Start</code> -> <code>Leave...</code>

== Disable Terminal Emulator Banner ==
This is the banner shown when you open a terminal.

If you want to disable it.

'''1)''' {{Open a Whonix-Workstation Terminal}}

'''2)''' Run the following command.

{{CodeSelect|code=
cp /etc/skel/.bashrc.whonix-orig ~/.bashrc
}}

'''3)''' The process is now complete.

See also [[#Disable Virtual Console Banner]].

== Virtual Consoles ==
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_console Virtual consoles] is a feature inherited from Debian GNU/Linux. It is noted here because not many users are aware of it. The Debian (not Whonix) feature is activated as follows:

* For a text console: Press <code>Alt + Crtl + F1</code>
* For additional text consoles: Press <code>Alt + Crtl + F2</code> or <code>F3</code> and so on.
* For a graphical console: Press <code>Alt + Crtl + F7</code>

=== KVM ===

The desired virtual console key combination is selected from under the <code>Send Key</code> option in a VM's graphic window.

=== Qubes ===

In dom0, run: <code>sudo xl console vm-name</code>. Replace "vm-name" with the name of the actual VM, for example.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo xl console sys-whonix
}}

=== VirtualBox ===

When the user is inside VirtualBox, the <code>Alt + Ctrl</code> keys are already registered by the host operating system.

Instead of the <code>Alt + Ctrl</code> combination, the VirtualBox Host Key <ref name=vboxhostkey /> is used. This means the user should press in combination <code>Host Key + F1 (F2,...)</code> for a text console(s), and <code>Host Key + F7 </code> for a graphical console inside VirtualBox.

=== Disable Virtual Console Banner ===
Similar to [[#Disable Terminal Emulator Banner]].

1) Open a [[#Virtual Consoles]].

2) Run the following command to restore original bashrc.

{{CodeSelect|code=
cp /etc/skel/.bashrc.whonix-orig ~/.bashrc
}}

'''Untested.''' Please leave feedback if this worked for you!

<ref>
3) Run the following command.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo unlink /etc/motd
}}
</ref>

3) The process is now complete.

= Non-Qubes-Whonix =
== XFCE Scaling ==
source: <ref>https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/HiDPI#Xfce</ref>

=== Fonts ===
<code>Settings Manager</code> -> <code>Appearance</code> -> <code>Fonts</code> -> <code>DPI</code> -> <code>Increase</code>

=== Window Manager Style ===
<code>Settings Manager</code> -> <code>Window Manager</code> -> <code>Style</code> -> <code>Theme</code> -> <code>Default-hdpi</code> or <code>Default-xhdpi</code>

=== gtk2 Menus and Buttons ===
<code>Settings Manager</code> -> <code>Settings Editor</code> -> <code>xsettings</code> -> <code>Gtk</code> -> <code>IconSizes</code> -> in row <code>Value</code> -> add the following line.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gtk-large-toolbar=96,96:gtk-small-toolbar=64,64:gtk-menu=64,64:gtk-dialog=96,96:gtk-button=64,64:gtk-dnd=64,64
}}

<ref>
"gtk-dnd" is for the icons during drag'n'drop, the others are quite self-explanatory. You can use any value your icon theme supports. 
</ref>

=== System Tray Icon Size ===
To enlarge icons in system tray.

<code>right-click on system tray</code> (aim for empty space / top pixels / bottom pixels, so that you will not activate icons themselves) -> <code>Properties</code> -> <code>set "Maximum icon size"</code> to <code>32</code>, <code>48</code> or <code>64</code>.

== RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter ==
{{RAM_Adjusted_Desktop_Starter}}

For more information, see [[RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter]].

== Show Desktop ==
In KDE 4, dashboard view replaces the old "Show Desktop" feature. Press <code>Ctrl + F12</code> to show the dashboard view. This keyboard shortcut can be changed in system settings.

<code>System Settings</code> -> <code>Shortcuts and Gestures</code> -> <code>Global Keyboard Shortcuts</code> -> <code>KDE component = Plasma Desktop Shell</code> -> <code>Show Dashboard</code>

For more information about the KDE 4 desktop, please see: https://www.kde.org/announcements/4.0/desktop.php

== Single vs Double-click ==
By default, launching desktop icons in KDE uses a single-click, instead of a double-click method. Users can change the default launching behavior to a double-click via the following steps.

<code>KDE</code> -> <code>Start menu button</code> -> <code>Applications</code> -> <code>Settings</code> -> <code>System Settings</code> -> <code>input devices</code> -> <code>mouse</code> -> <code>double click</code> -> <code>apply</code>

The procedure is now complete.

== Use Full-screen Mode ==
It is recommended to work in full-screen; this feature is also inherited from [[VirtualBox]]. To activate and deactivate full-screen mode, press the <code>Host Key <ref name=vboxhostkey><code>VirtualBox</code> -> <code>Global Settings</code> -> <code>Input</code> -> <code>Host Key</code>. The current Host Key is visible in the bottom right corner of VirtualBox.</ref> + F</code>. <ref>The normal VirtualBox default is <code>Right Ctrl + F</code>.</ref>

Full-screen mode leads to the Whonix (and Debian) default resolution and color depth of <code>1024x768x24</code>. Having a common value for these identifiers reduces the [[Protocol-Leak-Protection_and_Fingerprinting-Protection#Important_identifiers|fingerprinting risk]] to the user. Full-screen mode also helps to prevent users from accidentally launching applications on the host (such as a clearnet browser), instead of within Whonix.

{{Anchor|Whonixcheck / Timesync Writing to tty1}}
== Whonixcheck Writing to tty1 ==

[[File:writing to tty1 by adrelanos.png|400px|thumb|[[whonixcheck]] wrote its results to <i>tty1</i>]]
It is difficult to keep users updated with system status information when they are using a terminal instead of a graphical desktop environment. Therefore, the Whonix timesync and whonixcheck applications will very occasionally provide status messages, even if the user is logged into the terminal <i>tty1</i> and sees a command prompt. 

This feature can be useful, for example when the user has configured the Whonix-Gateway to their liking (if this was required at all) and successful status messages are posted about the system. On the other hand, status message output can be a hindrance, particularly if the user is doing something like editing a configuration file when it appears. If the user needs to complete activities without interruption, it is advisable to log into a tty other than <i>tty1</i>, for example <i>tty2</i>:

* Default-Download-Version users can use the VirtualBox Host Key method: <code>Right Ctrl + F2</code>. <ref>The <code>right Ctrl</code> key is the VirtualBox default.</ref>
* Physical isolation users can use the standard feature which comes with Debian: <code>Ctrl + Alt + F2</code>.

= Qubes-Whonix =

== Avoid VM Full Screen Mode ==

It is unrecommended to allow Qubes-Whonix or other VMs to [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/full-screen-mode/ completely "own" the full screen]. Overriding Qubes GUI virtualization daemon restrictions means users will not see colored decorations drawn by each VM window. In this case, a malicious application might not actually release the full screen (while it appears normal), or the full desktop may be emulated so users are tricked into entering sensitive information into false "trusted" domains. <ref>https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/full-screen-mode/</ref>
