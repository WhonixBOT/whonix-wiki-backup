= Single vs Double Click =
KDE uses single click instead of double click by default. If you want to change that to double click:

<code>
KDE -> Start menu button -> Applications -> Settings -> System Settings ->
input devices -> mouse -> double click -> apply - Done.
</code>

= Show Desktop =
In KDE 4, dashboard view replaces the old "Show Desktop" feature. Press CONTROL+F12 to show the dashboard view. This Keyboard shortcut can be changed in System Settings > Shortcuts and Gestures > Global Keyboard Shortcuts > KDE component = Plasma Desktop Shell > Show Dashboard.

More info about KDE 4 desktop, please see https://www.kde.org/announcements/4.0/desktop.php

= Use full-screen =
It's advised to work in full-screen. This feature is also inherited from [[VirtualBox]]. Press your host key<ref name=vboxhostkey>VirtualBox -> Global Settings -> Input -> Host Key. You can also see the current Host Key in the bottom right corner of VirtualBox.
</ref> and press F. That will activate full-screen. You end up with Whonix (and Debian) default resolution and color depth 1024x768x24<ref>As per [[Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection]].</ref>. To disable it the same key combination can be used.

= Virtual Consoles =
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_console Virtual consoles] is a feature inherited from Debian GNU/Linux. It's noted here, because not many people are aware of it. The Debian (not Whonix) feature is to press {{Code2|alt + crtl + F1}} or F2, F3, etc. to get for additional text consoles or F7 for graphical console.

Qubes:<br />
In dom0. <code>sudo xl console vm-name</code> for example <code>sudo xl console sys-whonix</code>

KVM:<br />
Select the desired virtual console key combination from under the <code>Send Key</code> option in a VM's graphic window.

VirtualBox:<br />
When being inside VirtualBox, the {{Code2|alt + ctrl}} keys are already registered by the host operating system.
Instead of alt + ctrl, you can use the VirtualBox Host Key<ref name=vboxhostkey />. That means, use Host Key + F1, F2, F7, etc. to do the same inside VirtualBox.

= Shut down the Whonix-Gateway =

To '''shut down''' the gateway simply enter

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo poweroff
}}

(Or use Start -> Leave...)

= RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter =
{{RAM_Adjusted_Desktop_Starter}}

= whonixcheck/timesync writing to tty1 =
[[Non-Qubes-Whonix]] only.

[[File:writing to tty1 by adrelanos.png|400px|thumb|[[whonixcheck]] wrote its results to tty1]]
It's difficult to keep terminal users, i.e. for users who are not using a graphical desktop environment, posted with the status if their system. Therefore two applications coming with Whonix, timesync and whonixcheck, will do something unique, or at least very rare.

Even if you are logged into your terminal tty1 and see a command prompt, it can happen that you suddenly see status messages from whonixcheck or timesync. This can be nice for example once your Whonix-Gateway configured to your liking (if you needed to do that at all) and just want to get posted with status messages about your system. On the other hand, this can be disturbing, if you're currently doing something, like editing a configuration file and then suddenly status messages are written to your screen. In that case, it is advised to log into tty other than tty1, for example tty2.

* Default-Download-Version users can use the VirtualBox host key (right ctrl by default) and F2: right ctrl + F2
* Physical isolation users can use the standard feature, which comes with Debian: ctrl + ALT + F2
