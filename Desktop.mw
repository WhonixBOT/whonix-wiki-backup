= Single vs Double Click =

KDE uses single click instead of double click by default. If you want to change that to double click:

<code>
KDE -> Start menu button -> Applications -> Settings -> System Settings ->
input devices -> mouse -> double click -> apply - Done.
</code>

= Use full-screen =

It's advised to work in full-screen. This feature is also inherited from Virtual Box. Press your host key <ref name=vboxhostkey>Virtual Box -> Global Settings -> Input -> Host Key. You can also see the current Host Key in the bottom right corner of Virtual Box.
</ref> and press F. That will activate full-screen. You end up with Whonix (and Debian) default resolution and color depth 1024x768x24. <ref>As per [[Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection]].</ref> To disable it the same key combination can be used.

= Virtual Consoles =

This feature is inherited from Debian GNU/Linux and Virtual Box. It's noted in Readme because not many people are aware of it. The Debian (not Whonix) feature is to press alt + crtl + F1 or F2, F3, etc. for additional text consoles or F7 for graphical console. Because Debian already registered alt + ctrl keys. Instant of alt + ctrl, use the Virtual Box Host Key. <ref name=vboxhostkey /> That means, use Host Key + F1, F2, F7, etc. to do the same inside Virtual Box.

= Shut down the Whonix-Gateway =

To '''shut down''' the gateway simply enter

<pre>sudo poweroff</pre>

(Or use Start -> Leave...)

= Autostart Desktop Environment based on Free RAM and Other Settings =
{{Testing}}

When booting up, you will be prompted and can always manually press ctrl + c to prevent KDE from starting.

By default, since Whonix 0.6.2, Whonix-Gateway comes with 768 MB virtual RAM. This can be reduced on systems with low resources.

* If there is more than 512 MB RAM in total, the desktop environment (KDE by default) will be started.
* If less than 512 MB RAM in total (for example, only 128 MB RAM in total), KDE (kdm) will not be started.

This should be be quite convenient, because users with low RAM could reduce (Whonix-Gateway) RAM to 128 MB and even if they sometimes wanted to configure/check something, they could assign 512 RAM and automagically boot into the graphical KDE desktop. There are also many settings in /etc/whonix.d/ to configure this feature, so if you want, you can also add a lot RAM and still don't boot into a desktop environment, use different display managers and so on.
