To disable the banner, follow these steps.
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' {{Open_a _product_ws_terminal}}

'''2.''' Run the following command.

{{CodeSelect|code=
cp /etc/skel/.bashrc.whonix-orig ~/.bashrc
}}

The process is now complete.

== Shut Down {{gateway_product_name}} (sys-whonix) ==

To shut down {{gateway_product_name}} (<code>sys-whonix</code>), open a terminal and run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo poweroff
}}

Alternatively, use the menu option:

* [[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]]: <code>Blue Q button</code> &rarr; <code>sys-whonix</code> &rarr; <code>Shutdown</code>
* [[{{non q project name short}}|{{non q project name}}]]: <code>Start</code> &rarr; <code>Leave...</code>

== Virtual Consoles ==
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_console Virtual consoles] is a feature inherited from Debian GNU/Linux which is unfamiliar to many users. The following keyboard shortcuts activate the Debian (not {{project_name}}) feature:

* Text console: Press <code>Alt + Crtl + F1</code>
** Additional text consoles: Press <code>Alt + Crtl + F2</code> or <code>F3</code> and so on.
* Graphical console: Press <code>Alt + Crtl + F7</code>

'''Table:''' ''Virtual Console Activation''

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! scope="col"| '''Platform'''
! scope="col"| '''Steps'''
|-
! scope="row"| KVM
| The desired virtual console key shortcut can be selected under the <code>Send Key</code> option in a VM's graphical window.
|-
! scope="row"| Qubes
| In dom0, run: <code>sudo xl console vm-name</code>. Replace "vm-name" with the name of the actual VM, for example. <br />
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo xl console sys-whonix
}}
|-
! scope="row"| VirtualBox
| Inside VirtualBox, the <code>Alt + Ctrl</code> keys are already registered by the host operating system. Instead of the <code>Alt + Ctrl</code> shortcut, the VirtualBox Host Key <ref name=vboxhostkey /> is used.
* Text console: Press <code>Host Key + F1 (F2,...)</code> for one or more text consoles. <br />
* Graphical console: Press <code>Host Key + F7</code> for a graphical console inside VirtualBox.
|}

=== Disable Virtual Console Banner ===

This process is similar to [[#Disable Terminal Emulator Banner|Disable Terminal Emulator Banner]].

1. Open a [[#Virtual Consoles|virtual console]].

2. Run the following command to restore the original bashrc (untested). <ref>Please leave feedback if this step works correctly.</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
cp /etc/skel/.bashrc.whonix-orig ~/.bashrc
}}

<ref>
3. Run the following command.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo unlink /etc/motd
}}
</ref>

The procedure is complete.

{{RAM_Adjusted_Desktop_Starter}}

For more information, see [[RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter]].

== Show Desktop ==
In KDE 4, dashboard view replaces the old "Show Desktop" feature. Press <code>Ctrl + F12</code> to show the dashboard view. This keyboard shortcut can be changed in system settings.

<code>System Settings</code> &rarr; <code>Shortcuts and Gestures</code> &rarr; <code>Global Keyboard Shortcuts</code> &rarr; <code>KDE component = Plasma Desktop Shell</code> &rarr; <code>Show Dashboard</code>

For more information about the KDE 4 desktop, please see: https://www.kde.org/announcements/4.0/desktop.php

== Single vs Double-click ==
By default, launching desktop icons in KDE uses a single-click, instead of a double-click method. Users can change the default launching behavior to a double-click via the following steps.

<code>KDE</code> &rarr; <code>Start menu button</code> &rarr; <code>Applications</code> &rarr; <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code>System Settings</code> &rarr; <code>input devices</code> &rarr; <code>mouse</code> &rarr; <code>double click</code> &rarr; <code>apply</code>

The procedure is now complete.

== Use Full-screen Mode ==
It is recommended to work in full-screen; this feature is also inherited from [[VirtualBox]]. To activate and deactivate full-screen mode, press the <code>Host Key <ref name=vboxhostkey><code>VirtualBox</code> &rarr; <code>Global Settings</code> &rarr; <code>Input</code> &rarr; <code>Host Key</code>. The current Host Key is visible in the bottom right corner of VirtualBox.</ref> + F</code>. <ref>The normal VirtualBox default is <code>Right Ctrl + F</code>.</ref>

Full-screen mode leads to the {{project name}} (and Debian) default resolution and color depth of <code>1024x768x24</code>. Having a common value for these identifiers reduces the [[Protocol-Leak-Protection_and_Fingerprinting-Protection#Important_identifiers|fingerprinting risk]] to the user. Full-screen mode also helps to prevent users from accidentally launching applications on the host (such as a clearnet browser), instead of within {{project_name}}.

{{Anchor|Whonixcheck / Timesync Writing to tty1}}
== Whonixcheck Writing to tty1 ==

[[File:writing to tty1 by adrelanos.png|400px|thumb|[[whonixcheck]] wrote its results to <i>tty1</i>]]
It is difficult to keep users updated with system status information when they are using a terminal instead of a graphical desktop environment. Therefore, the {{project name}} timesync and whonixcheck applications will very occasionally provide status messages, even if the user is logged into the terminal <i>tty1</i> and sees a command prompt. 

This feature can be useful, for example if {{gateway_product_name}} has a customized configuration (even if it was not strictly required) and successful status messages are posted about the system. On the other hand, status message output can be a hindrance, particularly if the user is doing something like editing a configuration file when it appears. If it is necessary to complete activities without interruption, it is recommended to log into a tty other than <i>tty1</i>, for example <i>tty2</i>:

* Default-Download-Version: utilize the VirtualBox Host Key method: <code>Right Ctrl + F2</code>. <ref>The <code>Right Ctrl</code> key is the VirtualBox default.</ref>
* Physical isolation: utilize the standard Debian feature which comes with Debian: <code>Ctrl + Alt + F2</code>.

== XFCE Scaling ==

A number of displays found in high-end laptops and desktops have High Dots Per Inch (HiDPI), providing a high resolution in a relatively small format. High-resolution mode can cause problems with certain software and the following adjustments may be necessary to improve HiDPI presentation in XFCE. <ref name=HiDPI>https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/HiDPI#Xfce</ref>

'''Table:''' ''XFCE Scaling Options''

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! scope="col"| '''Configuration'''
! scope="col"| '''Description'''
|-
! scope="row"| Fonts
| Change the DPI parameter as follows: <ref name=HiDPI /> <br />
* <code>Settings Manager</code> &rarr; <code>Appearance</code> &rarr; <code>Fonts</code> &rarr; <code>DPI</code> &rarr; <code>Increase</code> <br />
For example, it is reported that a value of <code>180</code> or <code>192</code> seems to work well on Retina screens, but trial and error may be necessary to get a more precise number for the relevant display.
|-
! scope="row"| gtk2 Menus and Buttons
| Follow these steps to change the default icon sizes of gtk2 menus, buttons and so on: <ref name=HiDPI /> <br />
* <code>Settings Manager</code> &rarr; <code>Settings Editor</code> &rarr; <code>xsettings</code> &rarr; <code>Gtk</code> &rarr; <code>IconSizes</code> &rarr; in row <code>Value</code> &rarr; add the following line. <br />
{{CodeSelect|code=
gtk-large-toolbar=96,96:gtk-small-toolbar=64,64:gtk-menu=64,64:gtk-dialog=96,96:gtk-button=64,64:gtk-dnd=64,64
}}
Note that the "gtk-dnd" parameter is for the icons during drag'n'drop, while the others are self-evident based on their name. Any value supported by the icon theme can be used. 
|-
! scope="row"| System Tray Icon Size
| Follow these steps to enlarge icons in the system tray: <ref name=HiDPI /> <br />
# <code>Right-click on system tray</code>: aim for empty space / top pixels / bottom pixels, so the the icons are not activated themselves. <br />
# <code>Properties</code> &rarr; <code>Set "Maximum icon size"</code> to <code>32</code>, <code>48</code> or <code>64</code>.
|-
! scope="row"| Task Bar Size
| To change the size of the task bar: <br />
* <code>Right-click on empty space in task bar</code> &rarr; <code>Panel</code> &rarr; <code>Panel Preferences</code> &rarr; <code>Row Size (Pixels)</code> &rarr; <code>move slider</code>
|-
! scope="row"| Window Manager Style
| Xfwm has two hidpi themes: Default-hdpi and Default-xhdpi. Change the theme as follows: <ref name=HiDPI /> <br />
* <code>Settings Manager</code> &rarr; <code>Window Manager</code> &rarr; <code>Style</code> &rarr; <code>Theme</code> &rarr; <code>Default-hdpi</code> or <code>Default-xhdpi</code>

== Avoid VM Full Screen Mode ==

It is unrecommended to allow [[{{q_project_name_short}}|{{q_project_name}}]] or other VMs to [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/full-screen-mode/ completely "own" the full screen]. Overriding Qubes' GUI virtualization daemon restrictions means the colored decorations drawn by each VM window will not be visible. In this case, a malicious application might not actually release the full screen (while it appears normal), or the full desktop may be emulated so users are tricked into entering sensitive information inside false "trusted" domains. <ref>https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/full-screen-mode/</ref>
