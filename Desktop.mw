= Single vs Double-click =
Be default, launching desktop icons in KDE uses a single-click, instead of a double-click method. Users can change the default launching behavior to a double-click via the following steps.

<code>KDE</code> -> <code>Start menu button</code> -> <code>Applications</code> -> <code>Settings</code> -> <code>System Settings</code> -> <code>input devices</code> -> <code>mouse</code> -> <code>double click</code> -> <code>apply</code>

Done.

= Show Desktop =
In KDE 4, dashboard view replaces the old "Show Desktop" feature. Press <code>Ctrl + F12</code> to show the dashboard view. This keyboard shortcut can be changed in the system settings.

<code>System Settings</code> -> <code>Shortcuts and Gestures</code> -> <code>Global Keyboard Shortcuts</code> -> <code>KDE component = Plasma Desktop Shell</code> -> <code>Show Dashboard</code>.

For more information about the KDE 4 desktop, please see https://www.kde.org/announcements/4.0/desktop.php

= Use Full-screen Mode =
It is recommended to work in full-screen; this feature is also inherited from [[VirtualBox]]. To activate and deactivate full-screen mode, press the <code>Host Key <ref name=vboxhostkey><code>VirtualBox</code> -> <code>Global Settings</code> -> <code>Input</code> -> <code>Host Key</code>. You can also see the current Host Key in the bottom right corner of VirtualBox.</ref> + F</code>. <ref>The normal VirtualBox default is <code>Right Ctrl + F</code>.</ref>

Full-screen mode leads to the Whonix (and Debian) default resolution and color depth of 1024x768x24. Having a common value for these identifiers reduces the [[Protocol-Leak-Protection_and_Fingerprinting-Protection#Important_identifiers|fingerprinting risk]] to the user.

= Virtual Consoles =
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_console Virtual consoles] is a feature inherited from Debian GNU/Linux. It is noted here because not many users are aware of it. The Debian (not Whonix) feature is activated as follows:

* For a text console: Press <code>Alt + Crtl + F1</code>.
* For additional text consoles: Press <code>Alt + Crtl + F2</code> or <code>F3</code> and so on.
* For a graphical console: Press <code>Alt + Crtl + F7</code>.
<br />
'''Qubes'''

In dom0, run.

<code>sudo xl console vm-name</code>. For example, <code>sudo xl console sys-whonix</code>.

'''KVM'''

The desired virtual console key combination is selected from under the <code>Send Key</code> option in a VM's graphic window.

'''VirtualBox'''

When the user is inside VirtualBox, the <code>Alt + Ctrl</code> keys are already registered by the host operating system.

Instead of the <code>Alt + Ctrl</code> combination, the VirtualBox Host Key<ref name=vboxhostkey /> is used. This means the user should press in combination <code>Host Key + F1 (F2,...)</code> for a text console(s), and <code>Host Key + F7 </code> for a graphical console inside VirtualBox.

= Shut down the Whonix-Gateway =

To '''shut down''' the gateway simply enter

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo poweroff
}}

(Or use Start -> Leave...)

= RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter =
{{RAM_Adjusted_Desktop_Starter}}

= whonixcheck/timesync writing to tty1 =
[[Non-Qubes-Whonix]] only.

[[File:writing to tty1 by adrelanos.png|400px|thumb|[[whonixcheck]] wrote its results to tty1]]
It is difficult to keep terminal users, i.e. for users who are not using a graphical desktop environment, posted with the status if their system. Therefore two applications coming with Whonix, timesync and whonixcheck, will do something unique, or at least very rare.

Even if you are logged into your terminal tty1 and see a command prompt, it can happen that you suddenly see status messages from whonixcheck or timesync. This can be nice for example once your Whonix-Gateway configured to your liking (if you needed to do that at all) and just want to get posted with status messages about your system. On the other hand, this can be disturbing, if you're currently doing something, like editing a configuration file and then suddenly status messages are written to your screen. In that case, it is advised to log into tty other than tty1, for example tty2.

* Default-Download-Version users can use the VirtualBox host key (right ctrl by default) and F2: right ctrl + F2
* Physical isolation users can use the standard feature, which comes with Debian: ctrl + ALT + F2
