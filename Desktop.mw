= Single vs Double Click =

KDE uses single click instead of double click by default. If you want to change that to double click:

<code>
KDE -> Start menu button -> Applications -> Settings -> System Settings ->
input devices -> mouse -> double click -> apply - Done.
</code>

= Use full-screen =

It's advised to work in full-screen. This feature is also inherited from Virtual Box. Press your host key <ref name=vboxhostkey>Virtual Box -> Global Settings -> Input -> Host Key. You can also see the current Host Key in the bottom right corner of Virtual Box.
</ref> and press F. That will activate full-screen. You end up with Whonix (and Debian) default resolution and color depth 1024x768x24. <ref>As per [[Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection]].</ref> To disable it the same key combination can be used.

= Virtual Consoles =

This feature is inherited from Debian GNU/Linux and Virtual Box. It's noted in Readme because not many people are aware of it. The Debian (not Whonix) feature is to press alt + crtl + F1 or F2, F3, etc. for additional text consoles or F7 for graphical console. Because Debian already registered alt + ctrl keys. Instant of alt + ctrl, use the Virtual Box Host Key. <ref name=vboxhostkey /> That means, use Host Key + F1, F2, F7, etc. to do the same inside Virtual Box.

= Shut down the Whonix-Gateway =

To '''shut down''' the gateway simply enter

<pre>sudo poweroff</pre>

(Or use Start -> Leave...)

= RAM Desktop Loader =
{{Testing}}

When booting up, you will be prompted and can always manually press ctrl + c to prevent KDE from starting.

By default, since Whonix 0.6.2, Whonix-Gateway comes with 768 MB virtual RAM. This can be reduced on systems with low resources.

* If there is more than 512 MB RAM in total, the desktop environment (KDE by default) will be started.
* If less than 512 MB RAM in total (for example, only 128 MB RAM in total), KDE (kdm) will not be started.

This should be be quite convenient, because users with low RAM could reduce (Whonix-Gateway) RAM to 128 MB and even if they sometimes wanted to configure/check something, they could assign 512 RAM and automagically boot into the graphical KDE desktop. There are also many settings in /etc/whonix.d/ to configure this feature, so if you want, you can also add a lot RAM and still don't boot into a desktop environment, use different display managers and so on.

= whonixcheck/timesync writing to tty1 =
{{Testing}}

Its difficult to keep terminal users, i.e. for users who are not using a graphical desktop environment, posted with the status if their system. Therefore two applications coming with Whonix, timesync and whonixcheck, will do something unique, or at least very rare.

Even if you are logged into your terminal tty1 and see a command prompt, it can happen that you suddenly see status messages from whonixcheck or timesync. This can be nice for example once your Whonix-Gateway configured to your liking (if you needed to do that at all) and just want to get posted with status messages about your system. On the other hand, this can be disturbing, if you're currently doing something, like editing a configuration file and then suddenly status messages are written to your screen. In that case, it's advises to log into tty other than tty1, for example tty2.

* Default-Download-Version users can use the Virtual Box host key (right ctrl by default) and F2: right ctrl + F2
* Physical isolation users can use the standard feature, which comes with Debian: ctrl + ALT + F2

= Disable Auto Login =
{{Stable}}

'''OPTIONAL. Only in case you want to do that.'''

If you aren't using [[Physical Isolation]], i.e. if you use the Default-[[Download]]-Version (Virtual Machines), its probable better to use the desktop locking mechanism of your host operating system.

These features are inherited from Debian and its packages.

On Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation open /etc/inittab

<pre>
sudo nano /etc/inittab
</pre>

Look for.

<pre>
## If you do not want this,
## comment in the next line and enable the the next but one.
</pre>

And below you'll see.

<pre>
#1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty1
1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty --autologin user 38400 tty1
</pre>

And change it to.

<pre>
1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty1
#1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty --autologin user 38400 tty1
</pre>
