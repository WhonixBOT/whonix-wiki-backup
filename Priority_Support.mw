<br />

* Encrypted communication is possible.
* Contracts with larger payments attract a greater developer priority to fulfill the customer's request.
* Customers with a higher prioritization can expect to receive faster and more comprehensive replies.
* Terms and conditions are subject to change under certain conditions.
* The quality of support may vary at times when the developer has a heavy workload.

Work samples which verify the quality of support are demonstrated in [https://forums.whonix.org/users/patrick/activity public {{project name}} forum activity]. Upon request, answers can be provided in private to clients. Several communication channels are available for client convenience: Primarily forum. Also e-mail. Upon request, instant messaging may also be possible, depending on the user's assigned priority.

'''Solution Probability'''

There is no guarantee that a solution can be found for every issue. Prior experience suggests problems related to the wide range of topics already covered in the [[Documentation]] have a higher chance of resolution, and within a shorter time frame. That said, other topics may be referred as well; get in touch for further advice (see contact details below).

'''Billing'''

Charge backs are not possible. For payment options, see [[Payments]].

'''How to Buy Priority Support'''

1. Choose a relevant payment option and make the [[Payments|payment]].<br />
2. The customer is eligible for priority support for a period of 30 days after the payment is made.<br />
3. E-mail Patrick with proof of the payment and submit your question. The proof of payment must include the customer's full name, the transaction ID, country of residence, and country of habitual residence.<br />
4. Depending on the customer's priority, the timeliness and comprehensiveness of the reply may vary.
