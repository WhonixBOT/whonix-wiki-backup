'''Priority Support'''

* Encrypted communication possible.
* The higher the payment, the higher the customers internal priority.
* The higher the customers internal priority, the quicker and more comprehensive replies can be expected.
* Terms and conditions may change.
* Quality of answers varies with workload.
* In future, support may be provided by third parties.

Work samples verifying the quality of support is demonstrated in [https://forums.whonix.org/users/patrick/activity public Whonix forum activity]. Upon request, answers can be provided in private to clients. Several communication channels are available for client convenience: forum, e-mail. On request depending on user priority also instant messaging.

'''Solution Probability'''

There is no guarantee that a solution can be found for every issue. Prior experience suggests problems related to the wide range of topics already covered in the [[Documentation]] have a higher chance of resolution, and within a shorter time frame. That said, other topics may be referred as well; get in touch for further advice (see contact details below).

'''Billing'''

Charge backs are not possible. For payment options, see [[Payments]].

'''How does it work?'''

1. Choose a payment option and make a [[Payments|payment]].<br />
2. A payment will make you eligible for priority support for 30 days from the payment.<br />
3. E-mail Patrick with a proof of your payment and your question. The proof of payment needs to include your full name, the transaction ID, your country of residence, your country of habitual residence.<br />
4. Depending on your priority, answers time and comprehensiveness of the reply may vary.
