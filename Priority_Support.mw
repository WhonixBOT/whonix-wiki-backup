'''Priority Support'''

* The higher the payment, the higher the customers internal priority.
* The higher the customers internal priority, the quicker and more comprehensive replies can be expected.
* Terms and conditions may change.

Work samples verifying the quality of support is demonstrated in [https://forums.whonix.org/users/patrick/activity public Whonix forum activity]. Upon request, answers can be provided in private to clients. Several communication channels are available for client convenience: email, forum. On request depending on priority also instant messaging.

'''Solution Probability'''

There is no guarantee that a solution can be found for every issue. Prior experience suggests problems related to the wide range of topics already covered in the [[Documentation]] have a higher chance of resolution, and within a shorter time frame. That said, other topics may be referred as well; get in touch for further advice (see contact details below).

'''Billing'''

Charge backs are not possible. For payment options, see [[Payments]].

'''Special Client Proposals'''
