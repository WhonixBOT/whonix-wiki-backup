= Skipping Postinst Scripts =
'''Advanced users only!'''

Let's say for example you don't like the <code>/usr/share/whonix/postinst.d/70_desktopicons</code> postinst script creating Desktop icons each time an update from Whonix apt repository comes.

Once you identified which postinst script you don't like, just run

<pre>
export WHONIX_BUILD_SKIP_SCRIPTS+=" 20_sanity_checks "
</pre>

before running "<code>apt-get dist-upgrade</code>".

Or you could add them to the <code>WHONIX_BUILD_SKIP_SCRIPTS</code> environment variable separated by spaces to <code>/etc/environment</code>, example.

<pre>
WHONIX_BUILD_SKIP_SCRIPTS="70_desktopicons 70_knetattach 70_whonix_apt_key"
</pre>

After changing <code>/etc/environment</code>, you need to reboot.

In case this feature is of interest to you, a solution for not requiring reboot and adding them to a config file in <code>/etc/whonix.d</code> could be easily and quickly added. Just make a feature request in that case.
