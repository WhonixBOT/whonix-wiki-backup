Despite usually being commended on the wiki page [[Install Software|Install Additional Software Safely]], installation of Chromium using APT is currently discouraged. This is because the Debian <code>buster</code> version of Chromium is outdated and comes with security vulnerabilities which where reported being exploited in the wild. <ref>

One option might be to install using <code>flatpak</code> from <code>flathub</code>. Special instructions are also required in this case.

Installation of <code>flatpak</code> from Debian backports. <ref>
Using Debian <code>buster</code> version of <code>flatpak</code>:

<blockquote>error: Failed to install org.chromium.Chromium: app/org.chromium.Chromium/x86_64/stable needs a later flatpak version (1.8.2)</blockquote>

{{Install Backport|package=

Add <code>flathub</code> repository. <ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo

Install Chromium from <code>flathub</code> repository. <ref>

</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
flatpak install flathub org.chromium.Chromium
}}

= Usage =
<ref>
<pre>
flatpak run org.chromium.Chromium
</pre>

<blockquote>Your Flatpak version does not support the expose-pids flag,
which means that Chromium is unable to run. This generally
happens if your distro's bubblewrap installation is setuid
instead of using user namespaces.</blockquote>
