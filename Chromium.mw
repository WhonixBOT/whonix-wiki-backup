In {{project name}}, use Tor Browser and no other browsers. Reasons for that are elaborated on the [[Tor Browser]] wiki page. When intending to install Chromium anyhow...

Despite usually being commended on the wiki page [[Install Software|Install Additional Software Safely]], installation of Chromium using APT is currently discouraged. This is because the Debian <code>buster</code> version of Chromium is outdated and comes with security vulnerabilities which where reported being exploited in the wild. <ref>

One option might be to install using <code>flatpak</code> from <code>flathub</code>. Special instructions are also required in this case. <ref>
<pre>
flatpak run org.chromium.Chromium
</pre>

<blockquote>Your Flatpak version does not support the expose-pids flag,
which means that Chromium is unable to run. This generally
happens if your distro's bubblewrap installation is setuid
instead of using user namespaces.</blockquote>
