|description=Using Whonix with QEMU instead of VirtualBox
}}

You can run Whonix with QEMU instead of VirtualBox or KVM as well. There is no specific documentation about QEMU, because instructions would be very similar to the instructions on [[KVM|Whonix's KVM wiki page]]. Instead of importing Whonix KVM Templates, you can simply import Whonix QEMU Templates.
