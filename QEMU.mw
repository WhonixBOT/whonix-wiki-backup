| text    = <u>Update</u>: QEMU support has been deprecated in favor of [[KVM]]. The slow performance of pure emulation makes it impractical for the majority of Linux users. Most consumer systems should support the hardware virtualization extensions required by KVM. <ref>The wiki formerly noted: "You can run {{project name}} with QEMU instead of VirtualBox or KVM as well. There is no specific documentation about QEMU, because instructions would be very similar to the instructions on [[KVM|{{project name}} KVM wiki page]]. Instead of importing {{project name}} KVM Templates, you can simply import {{project name}} QEMU Templates."</ref>
