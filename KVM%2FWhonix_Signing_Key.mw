|description=Get {{project name}} KVM signing key. Verify {{project_name}} KVM.
}}
= Introduction =

Since all {{project_name}} KVM releases are signed with the same key, it is unnecessary to verify the key every time a new release is announced. Trust in the key might gradually increase over time, but cryptographic signatures must still be verified every time a new release is downloaded. 

This page is strongly related to the [[Trust|Placing Trust in {{project_name}}]] page.

EDITORS NOTES:
- Not recommending 'scurl': Because these instructions are done on the host. Perhaps by users that are not yet {{project_name}} users. 'scurl' is not available to them.
- Not recommending curl: Because it may not be installed on their host. Perhaps Windows users are looking at these instructions.
- Instructions target regular users. Not from-source-builders.

'''1.''' [[Secure_Downloads|Securely]] download [[HulaHoop]]'s [[OpenPGP]] key. <ref>

}}
</ref><br />
{{Code2|<u>'''{{#widget:Key_HulaHoop}}'''</u>}}

'''2.''' Store the key as <code>hulahoop.asc</code>.

'''3.''' Check fingerprints/owners without importing anything. <ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=

}}

'''4.''' Verify the output.

The output should be identical to the following. 

<pre>
pub   rsa4096/50C78B6F9FF2EC85 2018-11-26 [SCEA]
      Key fingerprint = 04EF 2F66 6D36 C354 058B  9DD4 50C7 8B6F 9FF2 EC85

sub   rsa4096/EB27D2F8CEE41ACC 2018-11-26 [SEA]
</pre>

'''5.''' Import the key.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --import hulahoop.asc
}}

The output should confirm the key was imported.

<pre>
gpg: key 0x50C78B6F9FF2EC85: public key "HulaHoop" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
</pre>

''If the {{project_name}} signing key was already imported in the past'', the output should confirm the key is unchanged.

<pre>
gpg: key 0x50C78B6F9FF2EC85: "HulaHoop" not changed
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:              unchanged: 1
</pre>

If the following message appears at the end of the output.

<pre>
gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found
</pre>

Analyze the other messages as usual. This extra message does not relate to the {{project_name}} signing key itself, but instead usually means the user has not created an OpenPGP key yet, which is of no importance when verifying virtual machine images.

'''6.''' Advanced users can check [[#Web of Trust|Web of Trust]] further below for better security.

'''7.'''  Complete the {{project_name}} verification steps. 

If verifying {{project_name}} images, navigate to the relevant verification page below to finish the process:

== OpenPGP Web of Trust ==
HulaHoop's OpenPGP key can be verified through [[OpenPGP#The_OpenPGP_Web_of_Trust|The OpenPGP Web of Trust]]. {{project name}} [[Patrick Schleizer]]'s (adrelanos') has OpenPGP signed {{project name}} KVM developer HulaHoop's OpenPGP key.

First, acquire Patrick's signing key through instructions: [[Main/Whonix Signing Key|{{project name}} Main OpenPGP Signing Key]]
