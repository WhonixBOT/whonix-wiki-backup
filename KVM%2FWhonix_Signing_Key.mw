= Introduction =

Since all {{project_name}} KVM releases are signed with the same key, it is unnecessary to verify the key every time a new release is announced. Trust in the key might gradually increase over time, but cryptographic signatures must still be verified every time a new release is downloaded. 

This page is strongly related to the [[Trust|Placing Trust in {{project_name}}]] page.

EDITORS NOTES:
- Not recommending 'scurl': Because these instructions are done on the host. Perhaps by users that are not yet {{project_name}} users. 'scurl' is not available to them.
- Not recommending curl: Because it may not be installed on their host. Perhaps Windows users are looking at these instructions.
- Instructions target regular users. Not from-source-builders.

The output should be identical to the following.

The message <code>gpg: key 50C78B6F9FF2EC85: 1 signature not checked due to a missing key</code> is related to the [[OpenPGP#The_OpenPGP_Web_of_Trust|The OpenPGP Web of Trust]]. Advanced users can learn more about this [[#OpenPGP Web of Trust|below]].

'''5.''' Import the key.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --import hulahoop.asc

The output should confirm the key was imported.

<pre>

gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1

''If the {{project_name}} signing key was already imported in the past'', the output should confirm the key is unchanged.

<pre>
gpg: key 0x50C78B6F9FF2EC85: "HulaHoop" not changed

</pre>

If the following message appears at the end of the output.

<pre>
gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found
</pre>

This extra message does not relate to the {{project_name}} signing key itself, but instead usually means the user has not created an OpenPGP key yet, which is of no importance when verifying virtual machine images.

Analyze the other messages as usual.

'''7.'''  Complete the {{project_name}} verification steps.
