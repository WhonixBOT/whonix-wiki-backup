= Introduction =

The {{project name}} Windows Installer was developed with design goals focused on provide users with an fast and easy method to install {{project name}} in Microsoft Windows. When <code>whonix-installer.exe</code> is executed the latest stable VirtualBox version and both {{project name}} VMs are seamlessly installed on the Windows machine. Once {{project name}} is installed, users only need to click the start button in the {{project name}} GUI for both {{gateway product name}} and {{workstation product name}} VMs to start.

Before continuing, download both {{project name}} Windows Installer and corresponding OpenPGP signature in the above download table. Then continue with the steps needed to [[#Install GPG4win|verifying the Whonix installer]]. Users that are familiar with OpenPGP verification can additionally download the [https://www.whonix.org/windows/0brand.asc signing key] and verify the {{project name}} Windows installer.

== Overview ==
The following guide provides steps to: 

# Import the Intevation CA certificate.
# Install SignTool.
# Download and verify GPG4win.
# Install the developers signing key
# Verify the Whonix Windows Installer.

= Install Gpg4win  =
[https://gnupg.org/ GnuPG] is a complete and free implementation [[OpenPGP]] that allows users to encrypt and sign data and communications. [http://www.gpg4win.org/ Gpg4win] is a graphical front end for GnuPG that is used to for file and email encryption in Windows. The verification process for the {{project name}} Windows Installer begins with securely downloading an verifying the <code>gpg4win</code> package. Once completed GPG can be used from the command-line to verify the {{project_name}} Windows Installer.

= Verify the {{project name}} Windows Installer =

{{Box|text=
It is important to check the integrity of the downloaded {{project name}} Windows Installer to ensure that neither a man-in-the-middle attack or file corruption occurred; (see [[Download Security]]).

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text    = Do not continue if verification fails! This risks using infected or erroneous files! The whole point of verification is to confirm file integrity. This page is strongly related to the [[Trust|Placing Trust in {{project_name}}]] page.
}}

'''1.''' If not already completed, have GnuPG initialize your user data folder.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --fingerprint
}}

'''2.''' Download [[0brand]]'s [[OpenPGP]] key.

'''<u>[https://www.whonix.org/wiki/0brand.asc 0brand.asc]</u>'''

'''3.'''  Store the key as C:\Users\<user_name>\Downloads\0brand.asc 
<br></br>
'''4.''' Check fingerprints/owners without importing anything. 

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --keyid-format long --with-fingerprint 0brand.asc
}}

'''5.''' Verify the output. The output should be identical to the following. 

<pre>
pub   rsa4096/CFDBC23923C0433B 2019-08-08 [SC] [expires: 2021-08-07]
      Key fingerprint = B67C 6FE6 4BAE 05CD 05ED  775D CFDB C239 23C0 433B
uid                           "0brand" <0brand@mailbox.org>
sub   rsa4096/530523783446A24A 2019-08-08 [E] [expires: 2021-08-07]
sub   rsa4096/397090C34BED0A12 2019-08-08 [S] [expires: 2021-08-07]
</pre>

If the key was successfully imported, the following message will appear.

<pre>
gpg: key 0xCFDBC23923C0433B: public key ""0brand" <0brand@mailbox.org>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
</pre>

'''6.''' Import the key. 

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --import 0brand.asc
}}

The output should confirm the key was imported. 

<pre>
gpg: key 0xCFDBC23923C0433B: public key ""0brand" <0brand@mailbox.org>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
</pre>

Output already imported.

If the signing key was already imported in the past, ''the output should confirm the key is unchanged.''

<pre>
gpg: key 0xCFDBC23923C0433B: ""0brand" <0brand@mailbox.org>" not changed
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:              unchanged: 1
</pre>

'''4.''' Start the cryptographic verification, which can take several minutes. 

In Windows command prompt, change to the directory with the <code>whonix-installer.exe</code> package and corresponding signature file.

{{CodeSelect|code=
cd C:\Users\<user_name>\<directory_name>
}}

Next, verify the {{project name}} Windows Installer.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --verify-options show-notations --verify whonix-installer.exe.asc whonix-installer.exe
}}

If the Whonix Installer image is correct the output will tell you that the signature is good.

<pre>

<u>Note:</u> When the {{project name}} Windows Installer is executed, the currently installed VirtualBox package -- if there is one installed on the system -- is removed and the latest VirtualBox package is installed. <ref>At the time of writing (AUG 19 2019) VirtualBox 6.0.10 was the latest stable release version.</ref>

{{project name}} can be installed by simply running <code>whonix-installer.exe</code>. When installation is complete, users will be greeted with the {{project name}} GUI which can then be used to start the VMs. Keep in mind that installation could take can up to 15 minutes to complete depending on your hardware configuration.
<br></br>
In the folder you downloaded the {{project name}} Windows Installer: 
* <code>Double "click" whonix-installer.exe</code> &rarr;  <code>License agreement</code> &rarr; <code> "click"  Install &rarr; Finish</code>
