The {{project name}} Windows Installer was developed with design goals focused on provide users with an fast and easy method to install {{project name}} in Microsoft Windows. When <code>whonix-installer.exe</code> is executed the [[VirtualBox/Other_Versions#Recommended_VirtualBox_Version|Recommended VirtualBox version]] and both {{project name}} VMs are seamlessly installed on the Windows machine. Once {{project name}} is installed, users only need to click the start button in the {{project name}} GUI for both {{gateway product name}} and {{workstation product name}} VMs to start.

Before continuing, download both {{project name}} Windows Installer and corresponding OpenPGP signature in the above download table. Then continue with the steps needed to [[#Software Digital Signature Verification Tools Installation|install of the software digital signature verification tools]]. Then [[#Verify the {{project name}} Windows Installer|verify the {{project name}} digital software signatures]].

Users that are familiar with OpenPGP verification can go straight to download the [https://www.whonix.org/TODO signing key] and verify the {{project name}} Windows installer.

== Introduction ==
Due to [[Verifying_Software_Signatures#Conceptual_Challenges_in_Digital_Signatures_Verification|Conceptual Challenges in Digital Signatures Verification]] and [[Windows_Hosts#Windows_Software_Sources|impracticality, unpopularity of digital software signature verification on the Windows platform]], this is a cumbersome process. None of these issues are specific to {{project name}} to caused by {{project name}}. <ref>
This is being stated to avoid {{project name}} of getting blamed for this mess. Previously users put it this way:

<blockquote>
I never had to verify any software. Why Whonix makes this more complicated than everyone else?
</blockquote>
</ref>

<blockquote>
To keep a system secure and free of malware it is strongly recommended to [[Warning#Always_Verify_Signatures|always verify software signatures]]. However, this is very difficult, if not impossible for Windows users. Most often, Windows programs do not have software signature files (OpenPGP / gpg signatures) that are normally provided by software engineers in the GNU/Linux world.
</blockquote>

Most other vendors of software on the Windows platform are either unaware or ignore this issue. The {{project name}} project makes an effort to document and cope up with the mess on the Windows platform.

This page includes documentation on how to securely acquire Gpg4win - an application which can be used to verify digital software signatures provided by the {{project name}} project and other software.

Option A) The following guide provides steps to:

# Download and installation of SignTool.
# Download Gpg4win.
# Verify Gpg4win using SignTool.
# Import the developer's GPG signing key into Gpg4win.
# Verify the {{project name}} Windows Installer using Gpg4win.

SignTool is a Windows platform focused tool provided by Microsoft which can be used to verify software digital signatures.

[https://gnupg.org/ GnuPG] is a complete and free implementation [[OpenPGP]] that allows users to encrypt and sign data and communications. Popular on Windows, macOS and Linux platform. [http://www.gpg4win.org/ Gpg4win] is a graphical front end for GnuPG that is used to for file and email encryption in Windows. The verification process for the {{project name}} Windows Installer includes securely downloading an verifying the <code>gpg4win</code> package. Once completed GPG can be used from the command-line to verify the {{project_name}} Windows Installer.

Download and installation of SignTool (from the Microsoft website over TLS) and verification of Gpg4win using SignTool might be considered optional. This is because both, SignTool and Gpg4win (downloaded from the Gpg4win website over TLS) are only downloaded over [[SSL|TLS]], a very basic form of authentication. The argument for that is debatable. "It would be much more unlikely for a massive company like Microsoft to be compromised and serve malicious software than gpg4win server." <ref>
https://forums.whonix.org/t/testing-whonix-installer-for-windows/2987/217
</ref>

Option B) Therefore optionally the user might decide to skip the SignTool step and simplify as follows.

# Download and install Gpg4win.
# Import the developer's GPG signing key into Gpg4win.
# Verify the {{project name}} Windows Installer using Gpg4win.

= Verify the {{project name}} Windows Installer =

{{Box|text=
It is important to check the integrity of the downloaded {{project name}} Windows Installer to ensure that neither a man-in-the-middle attack or file corruption occurred; (see [[Download Security]]).

{{do_not_continue_on_gpg_verification_errors}}

'''1.''' If not already completed, have GnuPG initialize your user data folder.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --fingerprint
}}

'''2.''' Download [[0brand]]'s [[OpenPGP]] key.

'''<u>[https://www.whonix.org/wiki/0brand.asc 0brand.asc]</u>'''

'''3.'''  Store the key as C:\Users\<user_name>\Downloads\0brand.asc 
<br></br>
'''4.''' Check fingerprints/owners without importing anything. 

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --keyid-format long --with-fingerprint 0brand.asc
}}

'''5.''' Verify the output. The output should be identical to the following. 

<pre>
pub   rsa4096/CFDBC23923C0433B 2019-08-08 [SC] [expires: 2021-08-07]
      Key fingerprint = B67C 6FE6 4BAE 05CD 05ED  775D CFDB C239 23C0 433B
uid                           "0brand" <0brand@mailbox.org>
sub   rsa4096/530523783446A24A 2019-08-08 [E] [expires: 2021-08-07]
sub   rsa4096/397090C34BED0A12 2019-08-08 [S] [expires: 2021-08-07]
</pre>

If the key was successfully imported, the following message will appear.

<pre>
gpg: key 0xCFDBC23923C0433B: public key ""0brand" <0brand@mailbox.org>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
</pre>

'''6.''' Import the key. 

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --import 0brand.asc
}}

The output should confirm the key was imported. 

<pre>
gpg: key 0xCFDBC23923C0433B: public key ""0brand" <0brand@mailbox.org>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
</pre>

Output already imported.

If the signing key was already imported in the past, ''the output should confirm the key is unchanged.''

<pre>
gpg: key 0xCFDBC23923C0433B: ""0brand" <0brand@mailbox.org>" not changed
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:              unchanged: 1
</pre>

'''4.''' Start the cryptographic verification, which can take several minutes. 

In Windows command prompt, change to the directory with the <code>whonix-installer.exe</code> package and corresponding signature file.

{{CodeSelect|code=
cd C:\Users\<user_name>\<directory_name>
}}

Next, verify the {{project name}} Windows Installer.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --verify-options show-notations --verify whonix-installer.exe.asc whonix-installer.exe
}}

If the Whonix Installer image is correct the output will tell you that the signature is good.

<pre>

<u>Note:</u> When the {{project name}} Windows Installer is executed, the currently installed VirtualBox package -- if there is one installed on the system -- is removed and the latest VirtualBox package is installed. <ref>At the time of writing (AUG 19 2019) VirtualBox 6.0.10 was the latest stable release version.</ref>

{{project name}} can be installed by simply running <code>whonix-installer.exe</code>. When installation is complete, users will be greeted with the {{project name}} GUI which can then be used to start the VMs. Keep in mind that installation could take can up to 15 minutes to complete depending on your hardware configuration.
