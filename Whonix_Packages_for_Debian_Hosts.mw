= Whonix Packages for Debian Hosts =

== Introduction ==

Many of the packages developed under the Whonix umbrella can be thought of as independent projects in their own right. Their relevance applies to Debian hosts where they can increase privacy and security.

This guide will show how you can anonymously download these select packages from the Whonix repository. They can be downloaded stand-alone or combined if you opt for installing the <code>whonix-host</code> meta-package.
