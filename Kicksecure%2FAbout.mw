= Introduction =

{{kicksecure}} is a free and open-source (non-anonymous) Linux distribution that aims to provide a highly secure computing environment. It has been developed from the ground up according to a formidable -- and time proven -- defense in-depth security design. In the default configuration,  {{kicksecure}} provides superior layered defenses of protection from many types of [[Malware_and_Firmware_Trojans#Malware|Malware]].

{{kicksecure}} is a complete desktop operating system designed. Numerous applications come pre-installed with safe defaults which can be used immediately upon installation with minimal user input.

= Design =

== Usability by Default ==

While developed with security-focused design goals, {{kicksecure}} remains highly flexible. The layered approach to security allows applications to retain usability. {{kicksecure}} can be used for everyday "general-purpose computing" or for more risky activities that require a highly advanced security-centric platform. Since {{kicksecure}} is [[Freedom_Software|Freedom Software]] users may install any application of their choosing -- no restrictions are placed on how {{kicksecure}} can be used, customized or modified.

== Based on Debian ==

In simple terms, {{kicksecure}} is a collection of configuration files and scripts. Based on Debian, anything possible in "vanilla" Debian GNU/Linux can be replicated in {{kicksecure}}. Likewise, most problems and questions can be solved in the same way. For example, "How do I install OpenVPN in {{kicksecure}}?" would be answered with "The same way as in Debian; <code>apt-get install openvpn</code>".

== Based on Freedom Software ==

Many people wonder why developers would spend countless hours of their own time to build an operating system and then give it away. {{kicksecure}} developers believe it is immoral to benefit from those [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software Free] / [[Freedom_Software|Freedom Software]] components and give back nothing to the community. We stand on the shoulders of giants. {{kicksecure}} and many other Libre software projects are only made possible because people invested time in writing code and kept it accessible for the public's benefit. Of course, a lot of us just find it great fun.

= Releases =

== Kicksecure Version ==
Each {{kicksecure}} release is based on a particular version of Debian:

|}

== Release Schedule ==
{{kicksecure}} does not have a fixed release schedule. A new stable release only becomes available when it is deemed ready.

= FAQ =

== Is Kicksecure an Anonymity Distribution like Whonix? ==

While {{kicksecure}} and {{project_name}} share the whonix.org website, {{kicksecure}} is a ''security-focused'' operating system <u>not</u> a ''security <u>and</u> anonymity-focused'' operating system like {{project_name}}. {{kicksecure}} may be hosted on its own URL once a sizable user population emerges and/or additional resources become available for development.
