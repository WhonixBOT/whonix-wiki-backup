= User's Preferences =
== By Host Operating System ==
* Windows users -> recommend VirtualBox ova's
* Mac users -> recommend VirtualBox ova's
* Linux users ->  recommend VirtualBox ova's / recommend [[KVM]] as soon as ready

== By Download Target ==
* VirtualBox
* probably in mid term future [[KVM]] as well
* probably in long term future other visualizers as well

== By Security / Usability Compromise ==
* {{Code|Download Easy}}
** http-only, direct http download link ([https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/177 https as soon as implemented])
** no notes about download anonymity
* {{Code|Download More Secure}}
** Torrent + note, that anonymous download is difficult<ref>or at least very hard without Whonix, which is what they want to download in the first place</ref>
** http-only, direct http download link + hash check + note anonymous download
* {{Code|Download Most Secure}}
** http([https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/177 s]) + gpg
** notes about anonymous download
* {{Code|Download Utmost Secure}}
** Build from source code

== By Download Method ==
* http([https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/177 s])
* torrent

== By Download Anonymity ==
Low priority. Perhaps leaving this out.

* preferred download anonymity
* no preference about download anonymity

== By Release Life Cycle ==
* stable releases
* Testers-Only Releases

= Threat Models =
== No attacks prevented ==
* Http-only download without verification.
* Good for new users who should be warned that this is only to try Whonix and practice getting used to Linux.
* -> {{Code|Download Easy}}

== MITM download ==
* Man-in-the-middle attack between mirror and downloader.
* Can be defeated by using hash check, SSL or BitTorrent.
* -> {{Code|Download More Secure}}

== whonix.org server compromise ==
* Prevented by OpenPGP verification.
* -> {{Code|Download Most Secure}}

== build server compromise ==
* Prevented by building from source code.
* -> {{Code|Download Utmost Secure}}

= Windows Verification is hosed =
To check the hash, windows users have to either: <br />
1. Download a utility from a website and follow the instructions about how to check a hash <- Possible, but tedious. <br />
2. Download via Bittorrent <- Requires prior knowledge of Bittorrent <br />
3. All downloads via SSL <- [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/177 Can't right now] <br />
4. Learn GPG <- an important skill; but now we're jumping directory to the "advanced verification" stage

Verifying file integrity isn't something Windows encourages.

No one is providing a https enabled download link for a Windows hash verification tool. Maybe we should redistribute [rapid-crc-unicode-portable http://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/rapid-crc-unicode-portable] (just 1 MB) over https on whonix.org?

= See Also =
* Secure downloader. Stub downloader. Small tool that could be served from whonix.org over https, that could download and install the bigger files from elsewhere without https and do the verification. -> [[Dev/SecureDownloader]] -> Probably not. The Tor Project failed to implement such as tool (Thandy).
