= User's Preferences =
== By Host Operating System ==
* Windows users -> Install VirtualBox from virtualbox.org -> recommend [[VirtualBox]] ova's
* Linux users -> Install VirtualBox by using distribution's package manager -> recommend using [[KVM]] and {{Code2|.qcow2}} images
* Mac users -> Install VirtualBox by ? -> recommend VirtualBox ova's
* Qubes users -> [[Qubes]]

== By Target Platform ==
* [[VirtualBox]]
* [[QEMU]]
* [[KVM]]
* [[Qubes]]
* two physical computers ([[Dev/Build_Documentation/Physical_Isolation|Physical Isolation]])
* probably in long term future other virtualizers as well

== By Security / Usability Compromise ==
* {{Code|Download Easy}}
** http-only, direct http download link ([https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/177 https as soon as implemented])
** no notes about download anonymity
* {{Code|Download More Secure}}
** Torrent + note, that anonymous download is difficult<ref>or at least very hard without Whonix, which is what they want to download in the first place</ref>
** http-only, direct http download link + hash check + note anonymous download
* {{Code|Download Most Secure}}
** http([https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/177 s]) + gpg
** onion + gpg
** notes about anonymous download
* {{Code|Download Utmost Secure}}
** Build from source code

== By Download Method ==
* http([https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/177 s])
* [[Download_Security#Onion_Mirror|onion]]
* torrent

== By Download Anonymity ==
Low priority. Perhaps leaving this out.

* preferred download anonymity -> http(s) or onion, avoiding torrent
* no preference about download anonymity -> nevermind http(s) or torrent

== By Release Life Cycle ==
* Stable Releases
* Testers-Only Releases
* Experimental Releases

= Threat Models =
== No attacks prevented ==
* Http-only download without verification.
* Good for new users who should be warned that this is only to try {{project name}} and practice getting used to Linux.
* -> {{Code|Download Easy}}

== MITM download ==
* Man-in-the-middle attack between mirror and downloader.
* Can be defeated by using hash check, SSL, onion or BitTorrent.
* -> {{Code|Download More Secure}}

== whonix.org server compromise ==
* Prevented by OpenPGP verification.
* -> {{Code|Download Most Secure}}

== build server compromise ==
* Prevented by building from source code.
* -> {{Code|Download Utmost Secure}}

= Multiple Download Pages Considerations =
If we consider multiple download pages, users are accustomed to share direct download links. One who decided to use VirtualBox is likely to share the VirtualBox download page link. So the VirtualBox download page should ideally briefly mention, that there are also options on the main download page. Just a consideration. IF we decide that route.

= Windows Verification is hosed =
To check the hash, windows users have to either: <br />
1. Download a utility from a website and follow the instructions about how to check a hash <- Possible, but tedious. <br />
2. Download via Bittorrent <- Requires prior knowledge of Bittorrent <br />
3. All downloads via SSL <- [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/177 Can't right now] <br />
4. Learn GPG <- an important skill; but now we're jumping directory to the "advanced verification" stage

Verifying file integrity is not something Windows encourages.

No one is providing a https enabled download link for a Windows hash verification tool. Maybe we should redistribute [http://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/rapid-crc-unicode-portable rapid-crc-unicode-portable] (just 1 MB) over https on whonix.org?

= Implementation Ideas =
== Using html fieldset tag ==
Compatibility, it looks like everyone supports it: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_fieldset.asp

Small tool that could be served from whonix.org over https, that could download and install the bigger files from elsewhere without https and do the verification. -> [[Dev/SecureDownloader]] -> Probably not.
