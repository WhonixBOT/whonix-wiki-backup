View the Videos in your browser or download them.

=== View in your Browser ===

You can view those videos in Mozilla Firefox or with the Tor Browser Bundle. They are hosted on archive.org. These are html 5 videos in webm format. You do '''not''' require flash, although archive.org allows viewing them with Flash as well. You need to authorize html 5 twice with Tor Browser and you need a tiny bit patience until they finished loading, around 15 to 20 seconds.

=== Download Videos ===

Alternatively you could also download them from sourceforge.
