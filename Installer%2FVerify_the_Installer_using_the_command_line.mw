|description=Get Egos's OpenPGP signing key. Verify Installer Downloads.
}}
= Introduction =

You'll need GPG which you may find here: https://www.gpg4win.org

The releases of the Whonix-Installer have been signed by Ego which is why it is necessary to import his signing key to verify the Installer.

This page is strongly related to the [[Trust]] page.

= Download the key =
<!--
EDITORS NOTES:
- Not recommending 'scurl': Because these instructions are done on the host. Perhaps by users that are not yet Whonix users. 'scurl' is not available to them.
- Not recommending curl: Because it may not be installed on their host. Perhaps Windows users are looking at these instructions.
- Instructions target regular users. Not from-source-builders.

1. Download Ego's [[OpenPGP]] key:<br />
[https://download.whonix.org/windows/ego.asc ego.asc]

2. Store it as {{Code2|~/ego.asc}}.

3. Check fingerprints/owners without importing anything.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --with-fingerprint ego.asc
}}

4. Verify it shows the following. 

<pre>
pub  4096R/FBB8E862 2016-08-12 Ego <ego-superego-id@protonmail.com>
Key fingerprint = 2B72 83C9 D382 4D7F 9D11  8364 584A 8DF9 FBB8 E862
sub  4096R/D6D1BAA7 2016-08-12
</pre>

5. Import the key.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --import ego.asc
}}

The output should tell you that the key was imported:

<pre>
gpg: key FBB8E862: public key "Ego <ego-superego-id@protonmail.com>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1)
</pre>

'''If you had already imported Whonix signing key in the past''', the output should tell you that the key was not changed:

<pre>
gpg: key FBB8E862: "Ego <ego-superego-id@protonmail.com>" not changed
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:              unchanged: 1
</pre>

'''If you are shown the following message''' at the end of the output:

<pre>
gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found
</pre>

Analyse the other messages as usual: this extra message doesn't relate to Ego's signing key that you downloaded and usually means that you didn't create an OpenPGP key for yourself yet, which is of no importance to verify the virtual machine images.

= Verifying the Installer =

Now, download the cryptographic (OpenPGP) signature and save it in the same folder as the Installer:

[https://download.whonix.org/windows/Whonix-Installer.exe.asc Whonix-Installer.exe.asc]

Then, start the cryptographic verification, which may take several minutes.

<pre>
cd [the directory in which you downloaded the Installer and .asc files]
gpg --verify-options show-notations --verify Whonix-Installer.exe.asc Whonix-Installer.exe
</pre>

If the Virtual Machine image is '''correct''' the output will tell you that the signature is good:

<pre>

</pre>

This might be followed by a warning saying:

<pre>
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg: There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
</pre>

This doesn't alter the validity of the signature according to the key you downloaded. This warning rather has to do with the trust that you put in Whonix signing key and the [[OpenPGP#The_OpenPGP_Web_of_Trust|Web of Trust]]. To remove this warning you would have to personally sign Whonix signing key with your own key.

If all checks out, the Installer hasn't been tampered with and can be used safely.


If the Virtual Machine image is not correct the output will tell you that the signature is bad:

<pre>
gpg: Signature made Sun Nov 25 21:48:54 2012 UTC
gpg: using RSA key 77BB3C48
gpg: BAD signature from "Patrick Schleizer <adrelanos@riseup.net>"
</pre>

In this case do '''NOT''' use the Installer! Please download it instead again!
