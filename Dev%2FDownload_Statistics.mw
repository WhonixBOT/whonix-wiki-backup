|description=Development Notes about Whonix's Download Statistics
}}

= TBB's Influence on Download Statistics =
Windows might have fewer downloaders than any statistic says, because TBB for Linux and MacOS claims, that it's Windows, which muddles the statistic.

= What does "Anonymous Proxy" in sourceforge.net statistics mean? =
Sourceforge support, ctsai-sf on freenode in #sourceforge said, they use GeoIP for country detection and browser agent for operating system and browser. GeoIP, according to its website<ref>https://www.maxmind.com/en/ipauthentication</ref>, detects Anonymizer (they probably mean Tor and such), VPN and Open Proxies, so they everything into the same category of "Anonymous Proxy" - this is what sourceforge logs.

* Before announcing migration to whonix.org.
* [http://www.webcitation.org/6IWk5h4E9 Old design of download page] (Please ignore the "Moved to https://www.whonix.org" part. That snapshot has been forgotten and made later. Nevertheless it gives an impression how the old download page looked like.)
* Before using the new colored download table, which indicates, that http downloads without OpenPGP verification is the least secure method.
* After blog post announcing experimental BitTorrent downloads.<ref>http://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/featureblog/2013/07/experimental-optional-whonix-bittorrent-downloads/</ref>
* Let's see, if after the end of this campaign, more users use OpenPGP verification
* Or at least use BitTorrent - although we don't create download statistics for the .torrent files.
* Or at least use magnet links - but we probably can not get statistics about them.
