= What is Monero? =
Monero is a private-centric cryptocurrency launched in 2014 to allow direct and anonymous digital payments without being dependent on a central authority.

= Installation =
Apart from these hints, installing Monero in {{project name}} does not differ from installing Monero on any Linux based distribution.

Advanced [[Qubes]] users could look into [https://getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/cli_wallet_daemon_isolation_qubes_whonix.html CLI Wallet/Daemon Isolation with Qubes + {{project_name}}] <ref>

= Installation with a Remote Node =

Using a remote node provides a quick way to set up your Monero wallet. You will not have to download the entire blockchain.

It is important to note that the remote node:
* Cannot spend your XMR (you hold the keys).
* Does not know your IP address (we are connecting to it over Tor).
* Does not know your XMR address.
* Does not know your balance or private view key.

However, using a remote node is not without risk, you can read about the possible attacks here: https://moneroworld.com/

In general, if the wallet warns you about the node misbehaving exit the wallet and connect to a different node.

# Allow the wallet to synchronize.

===== GUI Troubleshooting =====
'''Changing the remote node'''
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Close your Monero GUI wallet.

'''2.''' Choose a node from the list below.

{{CodeSelect|code=
xmrtolujkxnlinre.onion:18081
xmkwypann4ly64gh.onion:18081
mmp26upm3gig2ltk.onion:18089

monerospv4fuwduf.onion:18081
7245ifq4iw3uvexs.onion:18081
zdhkwneu7lfaum2p.onion:18099
}}

'''3.''' Open the terminal.

* Double-click Konsole on the desktop.

'''4.''' Type the following command in the terminal.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sed -i 's/remoteNodeAddress=.*/remoteNodeAddress=REMOTENODE/g' ~/.config/monero-project/monero-core.conf
}}

Substitute <code>REMOTENODE</code> for the node you have chosen from the list of remote nodes. Do not forget to include the numbers at the end.

'''5.''' Start your wallet. 

It should now start synchronizing. If it doesn't, repeat these steps with a different remote node.
}}
'''Restoring a wallet from file'''

# Click 'Open a wallet from file'.
# Navigate to and select your <walletname>.keys file.
# Enter the password associated with that wallet.
# If your client gives an error, then close and restart your wallet. It should work now, if not, try restoring from seed.
# Continue with step 6 of Setting up the wallet.

'''Restoring a wallet from the 25 word seed'''

# Click 'Restore wallet from keys or mnemonic seed'.
# Enter your 25 word seed.
# Enter your wallet creation height / restore height (if unsure, see below).
# Continue with step 5 of Setting up the wallet.

'''Calculating the wallet creation height''''

* Take the current height from https://moneroblocks.info and subtract (720 * the number of days since you created the wallet). It does not have to be exactly right, but should at least be before the the first transaction to your wallet. Use this value as your restore height.

'''Large number of blocks remaining after restoring from seed'''

* You probably forgot to enter the restore height. To fix this go to Settings, scroll down to Debug info. Click to change wallet creation height and enter your wallet creation height, then save. You may need to reopen the wallet to have it detect this.

= Architecture =

Monero works by having contributors host large files which are equivalent to a public ledger. Any time someone broadcasts a transaction, every ledger maintainer updates their copy of the ledger and ensures no cheating or fraud has occurred. As with most cryptocurrencies, transactions are sent to Public Addresses which are derived from personally created private keys.

Since transactions could otherwise be traced by watching which addresses are sending to each-other, Monero uses a Diffie-Hellman key exchange using the transaction information on the sender's side and the public address on the receiver's end of a transaction to encrypt the recipients address on the ledger. To protect the sender, spending Monero is equivalent to forwarding the output of the previous transaction, so a users address is never stored on the ledger at all - this technique is called Stealth Addressing.

Since this solution is imperfect, and allows EABE attacks and is dependent on ECC for the key exchange, Monero uses a second layer of anonymity called Ring Signatures. When signing a transaction and broadcasting it to the network, Ring Signatures take signers from previous transactions and forge a new signature with Ring Size = N, where you cannot tell which entity in the group N actually authorized a transaction. This further obfuscates the blockchain and reduces the available attack vectors on the cryptocurrency as a whole, as well as introduces several zero knowledge proofs which prevent absolute analysis of the ledger.

Ring Signatures combined with Stealth Addressing prevent many attack vectors, but since new transactions are forwarded outputs from previous ones you can still perform analysis by viewing the amounts spent on-chain. To address this potential issue, a solution called RingCT was introduced which obfuscates the amount spent in a transaction.

Further attack vectors including cross-referencing an address posted in multiple places and IP leaks when connecting to the network are further developments sought out by the Monero community. These potential issues are addressed with Subaddresses and Kovri respectively.
