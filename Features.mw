= Whonix Features =
Whonix is an operating system focused on anonymity and security. It hides the user's IP address / location and uses the Tor network to anonymize data traffic. This means the contacted server, network eavesdroppers, and operators of the Tor network cannot easily determine which sites are visited, or the user's physical location. <ref>Without advanced, end-to-end, netflow correlation attacks which rely on statistical analysis of data volume and timing.</ref>

For a comprehensive comparison of Whonix with other popular anonymity platforms, see [[Comparison with Others|Comparison with Others]].

'''Primary Software Features'''

A number of applications are pre-installed and pre-configured with safe defaults to make them ready for use. Most commonly used applications are compatible with the Whonix design:

* [[Tor Browser]] is included for Internet browsing.
* Instant messengers like [[Chat#Tor_Messenger|Tor Messenger]], [[Chat#Tox|Tox]] and [[Chat#Ricochet_IM|Ricochet]].
* PGP-encrypted email with the [[Email#Mozilla_Thunderbird_with_TorBirdy|Mozilla Thunderbird client and TorBirdy]].
* Secure data transfer to and from a server with [[File_Transfer|scp]].
* Unobserved administration of servers via SSH.
* Web server administration with Apache, ngnix, IRC servers, and more via [[Onion Services]].
* A host of other [[Software|software programs]].


With the Whonix design, it is possible to "torify" applications which are not capable of proxy support by themselves. Further, the user is not jeopardized by installing custom applications or personalizing the desktop.

Detailed [[Documentation|documentation]] has been created by the developers and the Whonix community. It explains the Whonix design, software, possible configurations, security / privacy aspects, and various advanced topics.

= Whonix Advantages =
* All applications are automatically routed via Tor, including those which do not support proxy settings. <ref>{{note}} For application warnings, see [[Documentation]].</ref> <ref>{{note}} UDP is not natively supported by Tor and will therefore also not work in Whonix (unless a [[Tunnel_UDP_over_Tor|VPN]] is used).</ref> <ref>{{note}} Services that need to listen on publicly reachable ports (open / forwarded ports) are also not supported. However, users may run [[Onion Services]] which are reachable via Tor or tor2web ([https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/tor2web care is required]).</ref> <ref>[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7830 UDP is not supported by Tor]</ref>
* Installation of any software package is possible. <ref>{{note}} The program must be able to run on Debian GNU/Linux or [[Other Operating Systems]] which are used. See also [[Install Software|Software installation on Whonix-Workstation]] for further details.</ref> <ref>{{note}} ICMP, ping, VoIP calls over UDP and so on.</ref> <ref>{{note}} Skype works over TCP, but it is not recommended because it is proprietary, closed source software and there is no control over the encryption keys. Skype authorities can compromise a user at any moment. A secure encryption / authentication design looks different. For example GPG and OTR are secure, because the user has control over the keys, not the server. See [[Voip#...|VoIP Skype section]] for details.</ref> <ref>{{note}} [[Tunnel UDP over Tor]]</ref>
* Safe hosting of [[Onion Services]] is possible. <ref>{{note}} Even if someone hacks the user's hidden server software (lighttpd, thttpd, apache, etc.), they cannot steal the onion service key. The key is stored on the Whonix-Gateway. Once a clean Whonix-Workstation is used, no one can impersonate the onion service anymore.</ref> <ref>{{note}} The Whonix-Workstation is where the browser, IRC client and other user applications are run. The Whonix-Gateway is where Tor and the firewall are run.</ref>
* Protection against side channel attacks; no IP address or DNS leaks are possible. <ref>{{note}} Whonix does not automatically protect against other possible leaks like username, time zone, and so on. Users should read the [[Documentation]] to learn how to mitigate these threats. Additionally, Whonix's [[Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection]] mitigates many possible fingerprinting attacks by using common, non-identifying defaults. For example, the username is set to <i>user</i>, the timezone is set to UTC, and so on.</ref>
* Advantage over Live CDs: Tor's data directory is still available after reboot, due to persistent storage. Tor requires persistent storage to save its Entry Guards. <ref>https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#EntryGuards</ref>.
* Java, JavaScript, <ref>{{note}} There is no functional Javascript difference when it is enabled in Whonix's Tor Browser versus the standard Tor Browser Bundle (TBB).</ref> <ref>Of course, using JavaScript in the Whonix Tor Browser protects against IP address leaks, but browser fingerprinting risks still apply. For more information, see [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/WebBrowsers Web-browser]!</ref> flash, [[Browser Plugins]], <ref>{{note}} Plugins are still not recommended, as they may decrease anonymity (for example, flash cookies) and they often have security vulnerabilities. Most popular plugins are closed source. See [[Browser Plugins]] for more information.</ref> and mis-configured applications cannot leak the user's real external IP address. See [[Security in Real World|Security in the Real World]].
* Protection against IP address / location discovery through root exploits (malware <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware</ref> with root rights inside Whonix-Workstation). However, users should avoid testing this protective feature. <ref>{{note}} If Whonix-Workstation gets rooted, the adversary cannot find out the user's real IP address / location. The reason is Whonix-Workstation can only connect through the Whonix-Gateway. More skill is required to compromise Whonix, see [[Comparison with Others#Attacks|Attack Comparison Matrix]] and [[Design]].</ref>
* Only free software is used. <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software</ref>
* Building Whonix from source is easy, see [[Dev/Build Documentation|Build Documentation]].
* Tor <ref>https://www.torproject.org</ref> and Tor Browser <ref>https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en</ref> are not running inside the same virtual machine. For example, that means an exploit in the browser can't affect the integrity of the Tor process. <ref>{{note}} [[Vidalia]] is now deprecated; [[Tor Controller|arm]] is installed as the alternative.</ref>
* It is possible to use Whonix in conjunction with VPNs, SSH and other proxies. However, read the  [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN Tor plus VPN/proxies Warning] before proceeding. Every permutation is possible; VPNs / SSH / other proxies can be combined and used pre- and/or post-Tor tunnels.
* [[Other_Anonymizing_Networks|Other anonymizing networks]] like Freenet, GNUnet, I2P, JonDonym and Retroshare can be used.
* A host of [[Features#Whonix Features|Features]] are available.
* Numerous optional configurations, additional features, and add-ons are available.
* Best possible [[Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection]].
* Private obfuscated [[Bridges]] can be added to {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}} (the Tor configuration file).
* Whonix-Gateway can also torify Windows, see [[Other Operating Systems]].

= Whonix Disadvantages =
* More difficult to set up compared to the regular Tor Browser.
* Needs virtual machines or spare hardware for operation.
* Updating the OS and applications behind the Tor proxy is slow.
* Higher maintenance is required. <ref>{{note}} Users need to maintain and update three OSs instead of one. Also, several passwords must be remembered, unless [[Qubes-Whonix]] is used.</ref>
