= Whonix Features =
Whonix is an Anonymous Operating System. It hides your IP/location and uses Tor to anonymize your data traffic. This means that neither the contacted server, nor any eavesdropper on your connections, nor the operators of the Tor network themselves can realize which webservice you use.

To learn about its differences, check the [[Comparison with Others]].

Basically any program can be used together with Whonix:

* For web browsing, [[Tor Browser]] is included.
* Messengers, like Pidgin, with the Jabber protocol and the OTR plugin.
* Privacy friendly e-mail client: [[Email#Mozilla_Thunderbird_with_TorBirdy|Mozilla Thunderbird with TorBirdy]]
* scp for secure data transfer from and to a server.
* Unobserved administration of servers via SSH
* Web servers: Apache, ngnix, IRC servers, etc. via [[Hidden Services]]
* Other programs...

It is possible, with the help of Whonix, to use applications via Tor, which are not capable of proxy support by themselves.

Everything is explained in [[Documentation]].

= Advantages of Whonix =
* All applications, including those, which do not support proxy settings, will automatically be routed through Tor.<ref>{{note}} For application warnings, see [[Documentation]].</ref> <ref>{{note}} IPv6 is not yet supported by Tor. Limited workaround: [[OnionCat]]</ref> <ref>{{note}} UDP is not supported by Tor, thus will not work in Whonix as well.</ref> <ref>[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7830 UDP is not supported by Tor]</ref> <ref>Limited workaround: [[OnionCat]]</ref>
<ref>{{note}} Services that need to listen on publicly reachable ports (open/forwarded ports) are also not supported. However you may run [[Hidden Services]] which are reachable via Tor or tor2web ([https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/tor2web be careful]).</ref>
* Installation of any software package possible. <ref>{{note}} Must be able to run on Debian GNU/Linux or you can use [[Other Operating Systems]]. See also [[Install Software|Software installation on Whonix-Workstation]] for details.</ref> <ref>{{note}} ICMP, ping, VOIP calls over UDP, etc...</ref> <ref>{{note}} Skype over TCP does work, but it's not recommended, because it's proprietary, closed source and there is no control over the encryption keys. Skype authority can compromise you out any moment. A secure encryption/authentication design looks different. For example GPG and OTR are secure, because the user has control over the keys, not the server. See [[Voip#...|Voip Skype section]] for details.</ref> <ref>{{note}} [[OnionCat]]</ref> <ref>{{note}} [[Tunnel UDP over Tor]]</ref>
* Safe hosting of [[Hidden Services]] possible. <ref>{{note}} Even if someone hacks your hidden server software (lighttpd, thttpd, apache, etc.), he can not steal your hidden service key. The key is stored on the Whonix-Gateway. Once you cleaned your Whonix-Workstation, no one can impersonate your hidden service anymore.</ref> <ref>{{note}} The Workstation is the place where the browser, IRC client and so on is running. The Gateway is the place where Tor and the firewall is running.</ref>
* Protection against side channel attacks, no IP or DNS leaks possible. <ref>{{note}} Whonix protects against IP and DNS leaks. Other possible leaks (such as username; time zone; etc.) and how to mitigate them see [[Documentation]]. Additionally Whonix's [[Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection]] mitigates many possible fingerprinting attacks by using common, non-identifying defaults. (username set to user; timezone set to UTC; etc.) </ref>
* Advantage over Live CD's: Tor's data directory is still available after reboot, due to persistent storage. Tor requires persistent storage to save its Entry Guards <ref>https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#EntryGuards</ref>.

* Java / JavaScript <ref>{{note}} There is no difference compared to using JavaScript directly within the Tor Browser Bundle.</ref> <ref>Of course JavaScript within TBB inside Whonix will also not leak your IP. Browser fingerprinting still applies. For more information see [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/WebBrowsers Web-browser]!</ref> / flash / [[Browser Plugins]] <ref>{{note}} This is still not recommended as they may decrease anonymity (e.g. flash cookies) and often have security vulnerabilities. Most popular plugins are closed source. See [[Browser Plugins]] for more information.</ref> / misconfigured applications cannot leak your real external IP. See [[Security in Real World]].
* Protection against IP/location discovery through root exploits (Malware <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware</ref> with root rights) inside Whonix-Workstation. But you should really not test it <ref>{{note}} In case Whonix-Workstation gets rooted, the adversary can not find out the users real IP/location. This is because Whonix-Workstation can only connect through the Whonix-Gateway. How difficult is it to compromise Whonix? See [[Comparison with Others#Attacks|Attack Comparison Matrix]] and [[Design]]. More skill is required.</ref>

* Uses only Free Software <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software</ref>.
* Building Whonix from source is easy, see [[Dev/Build Documentation]].
* Tor <ref>https://www.torproject.org</ref> + Vidalia <ref>https://www.torproject.org/projects/vidalia.html.en</ref> and Tor Browser <ref>https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en</ref> are not running inside the same machine. That means that for example an exploit in the browser can't affect the integrity of the Tor process. <ref>{{note}} [[Vidalia]] is optional; [[Tor Controller|arm]] is installed as alternative.</ref>
* It is possible to use Whonix in conjunction with VPNs, ssh and other proxies. But see [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN Tor plus VPN/proxies Warning]. Everything possible, as first chain or last chain, or both.
* Loads of [[Features#Whonix Features|Features]].
* Loads of Optional Configurations (additional features / Add-Ons) available.
* Best possible [[Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection]].
* Private obfuscated [[Bridges]] can be added to {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}.
* Whonix-Gateway can also torify Windows, see [[Other Operating Systems]].

= Disadvantages of Whonix =
* More difficult to set up compared to the regular Tor Browser Bundle.
* Needs virtual machines or spare hardware.
* Updating OS and applications behind the Tor proxy is slow.
* Higher maintenance required. <ref>{{note}} You need to maintain three instead of one OS. You need to remember several passwords and update at least three systems.</ref>
