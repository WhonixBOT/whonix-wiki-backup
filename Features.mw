= Whonix Features =

Whonix is an operating system focused on anonymity and security. It hides the user's IP address / location and uses the Tor network to anonymize data traffic. This means the contacted server, network eavesdroppers and operators of the Tor network cannot easily determine which sites are visited or the user's physical location. <ref>Without advanced, end-to-end, netflow correlation attacks which rely on statistical analysis of data volume and timing.</ref>

For a comprehensive comparison of Whonix with other popular anonymity platforms, see [[Comparison with Others|here]].

== Software Overview ==

A number of applications are pre-installed and pre-configured with safe defaults to make them ready for use. Most popular applications are compatible with the Whonix design:

* [[Tor Browser]] is included for Internet browsing.
* Instant messengers like [[Chat#Tox|Tox]] and [[Chat#Ricochet_IM|Ricochet]].
* PGP-encrypted email with [[Email#Mozilla_Thunderbird_with_TorBirdy|Mozilla Thunderbird, Enigmail and TorBirdy]]. <ref>Later Whonix releases might not come with Thunderbird email client pre-installed, See: This [https://forums.whonix.org/t/thunderbird-no-longer-installed-by-default/6505 Whonix Forum Thread] for more details.</ref> 
* Secure data transfer to and from a server with [[File_Transfer|scp]].
* Unobserved administration of servers via SSH.
* Web server administration with Apache, ngnix, IRC servers, and more via [[Onion Services|onion services]].
* A host of other [[Software|software programs]].

The Whonix design flexibly permits the "torification" of applications which are not capable of proxy support by themselves. Further, the user is not jeopardized by installing custom applications or personalizing the desktop.

Detailed [[Documentation|documentation]] has been produced by developers and the Whonix community. Various issues are explained in depth, including the Whonix design, available software, the host of possible configurations, security and privacy considerations, and numerous advanced topics.

! scope="col"| '''Whonix Feature'''
! scope="col"| '''Security and/or Anonymity Advantage'''
|-
! scope="row"| Best Possible [[Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection]]
| Java, JavaScript, <ref>There is no functional JavaScript difference when it is enabled in Whonix's Tor Browser versus the standard Tor Browser Bundle (TBB).</ref> <ref>Of course, using JavaScript in the Whonix Tor Browser protects against IP address leaks, but browser fingerprinting risks still apply. For more information, see [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/WebBrowsers Web-browser]!</ref> Flash, browser plugins <ref>Plugins are still not recommended, as they may decrease anonymity (for example, flash cookies) and they often have security vulnerabilities. Most popular plugins are closed source. Although deprecated, the [[Browser_Plugins#Warning_not_to_use_them|browser plugins warnings]] section is still valid.</ref> and mis-configured applications cannot leak the user's real external IP address. <ref>See [[Security in Real World|Security in the Real World]].</ref>
|-
! scope="row"| Build Simplicity
| Building Whonix from source is easy; see [[Dev/Build Documentation|Build Documentation]].
|-
! scope="row"| Combine Anonymizing Networks
| [[Other_Anonymizing_Networks|Other anonymizing networks]] like Freenet, GNUnet, I2P, JonDonym and Retroshare can be used.
|-
! scope="row"| Fully Featured
| A host of [[Features#Whonix Features|Features]] are available.
|-
! scope="row"| Highly Configurable
| Numerous optional configurations, additional features and add-ons are available.
|-
! scope="row"| Open Source
| Only free software is used. <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software</ref>
|-
! scope="row"| Private Obfuscated [[Bridges]]
| Bridges can be added to the Tor configuration file.
|-
! scope="row"| Process Separation
| Tor <ref>https://www.torproject.org</ref> and Tor Browser <ref>https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en</ref> are not running inside the same virtual machine which means an exploit in the browser cannot affect the integrity of the Tor process. <ref>[[Vidalia]] is now deprecated; [[Tor Controller|arm]] is installed as the alternative.</ref>
|-
! scope="row"| Protection Against IP Address / Location Discovery
| Exploits using malware <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware</ref> with root rights inside Whonix-Workstation (<code>anon-whonix</code>) are foiled. However, users should avoid testing this protective feature. <ref>If Whonix-Workstation (<code>anon-whonix</code>) is rooted, the adversary cannot find out the user's real IP address / location. The reason is Whonix-Workstation (<code>anon-whonix</code>) can only connect through the Whonix-Gateway (<code>sys-whonix</code>). More skill is required to compromise Whonix, see [[Comparison with Others#Attacks|Attack Comparison Matrix]] and [[Design]].</ref>
|-
! scope="row"| Protection Against Side Channel Attacks
| No IP address or DNS leaks are possible. <ref>Whonix does not automatically protect against other possible leaks like username, time zone and so on. Users should read the [[Documentation]] to learn how to mitigate these threats. Additionally, Whonix's [[Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection]] mitigates many possible fingerprinting attacks by using common, non-identifying defaults. For example, the username is set to <i>user</i>, the timezone is set to UTC etc.</ref>
|-
! scope="row"| Safe Hosting of [[Onion Services]]
| Even if someone hacks the user's hidden server software (lighttpd, thttpd, apache, etc.), they cannot steal the onion service key. <ref>The key is stored on the Whonix-Gateway (<code>sys-whonix</code>). Once a clean Whonix-Workstation (<code>anon-whonix</code>) is used, no one can impersonate the onion service anymore.</ref> <ref>The Whonix-Workstation (<code>anon-whonix</code>) is where the browser, IRC client and other user applications are run. The Whonix-Gateway (<code>sys-whonix</code>) is where Tor and the firewall are run.</ref>
|-
! scope="row"| Software Flexibility
| Installation of any software package is possible. <ref>The program must be able to run on Debian GNU/Linux or [[Other Operating Systems]] which are used. See also [[Install Software|Software installation on Whonix-Workstation (<code>anon-whonix</code>)]] for further details.</ref> <ref>ICMP, ping, VoIP calls over UDP and so on.</ref> <ref>Skype works over TCP, but it is not recommended because it is proprietary, closed source software and there is no control over the encryption keys. Skype authorities can compromise a user at any moment. A secure encryption / authentication design looks different. For example GPG and OTR are secure, because the user has control over the keys, not the server. See [[Voip#Skype|VoIP Skype section]] for further details.</ref> <ref>[[Tunnel UDP over Tor]]</ref>
|-
! scope="row"| Tor Data Persistence
| A major Whonix advantage over Live CDs is that Tor's data directory is still available after reboot due to persistent storage. Tor requires persistent storage to save its Entry Guards. <ref>https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#EntryGuards</ref>
|-
! scope="row"| Tor Enforcement
| All applications are automatically routed via Tor, including those which do not support proxy settings. <ref>For application warnings, see [[Documentation]].</ref> <ref>UDP is not natively supported by Tor and will therefore also not work in Whonix (unless a [[Tunnel_UDP_over_Tor|VPN]] is used).</ref> <ref>Services that need to listen on publicly reachable ports (open / forwarded ports) are also not supported. However, users may run [[Onion Services]] which are reachable via Tor or tor2web ([https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/tor2web care is required]).</ref> <ref>[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7830 UDP is not supported by Tor]</ref>
|-
! scope="row"| Torify Windows
| Whonix-Gateway (<code>sys-whonix</code>) can also torify Windows. <ref>See [[Other Operating Systems]].</ref>
|-
! scope="row" | Tunnel Chaining
| It is possible to combine Whonix with VPNs, SSH and other proxies. <ref>Users should read the [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN Tor plus VPN/proxies Warning] before proceeding. </ref> Every permutation is possible; VPNs / SSH / other proxies can be combined and used pre- and/or post-Tor tunnels.

= Whonix Disadvantages =

* More difficult to set up compared to the regular Tor Browser.
* Needs virtual machines or spare hardware for operation.
* Updating the operating system and applications behind the Tor proxy is slow.
* [[Qubes-Whonix]] has [https://www.qubes-os.org/hcl/ strict hardware requirements]. <ref>Particularly for Qubes R4 and later releases.</ref>
* Higher maintenance is required. <ref>Users need to maintain and update three OSs instead of one. Also, several passwords must be remembered, except for [[Qubes-Whonix]] which has a [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/vm-sudo/ password-less root feature].</ref>
