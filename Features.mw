= Whonix Features =
Whonix is an operating system focused on anonymity and security. It hides a user's IP address / location and uses the Tor network to anonymize data traffic. This means that the contacted server, network eavesdroppers, and operators of the Tor network cannot easily determine which sites are visited, nor a user's physical location. <ref>Without advanced, end-to-end, netflow correlation attacks which rely on statistical analysis of data volume and timing.</ref>

For a comprehensive comparison of Whonix with other popular anonymity platforms, see [[Comparison with Others|Comparison with Others]].

'''Primary Software Features'''

A number of applications are pre-installed and pre-configured with safe defaults to make them ready for use. Most commonly used applications are compatible with the Whonix design:

* [[Tor Browser]] is included for Internet browsing.
* Instant messengers like [[Chat#Tor_Messenger|Tor Messenger]], [[Chat#Tox|Tox]] and [[Chat#Ricochet_IM|Ricochet]].
* PGP-encrypted email with the [[Email#Mozilla_Thunderbird_with_TorBirdy|Mozilla Thunderbird client and TorBirdy]].
* Secure data transfer to and from a server with [[File_Transfer|scp]].
* Unobserved administration of servers via SSH.
* Web server administration with Apache, ngnix, IRC servers, and more via [[Hidden Services]].
* A host of other [[Software|software programs]].


With the Whonix design, it is possible to "torify" applications which are not capable of proxy support by themselves. Further, the user is not jeopardized by installing custom applications or personalizing the desktop.

Detailed [[Documentation|documentation]] has been created by the developers and the Whonix community. It explains the Whonix design, software, possible configurations, security / privacy aspects, and various advanced topics.

= Advantages of Whonix =
* All applications, including those, which do not support proxy settings, will automatically be routed through Tor.<ref>{{note}} For application warnings, see [[Documentation]].</ref> <ref>{{note}} UDP is not supported by Tor, thus will not work in Whonix as well.</ref> <ref>[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7830 UDP is not supported by Tor]</ref>
<ref>{{note}} Services that need to listen on publicly reachable ports (open/forwarded ports) are also not supported. However you may run [[Hidden Services]] which are reachable via Tor or tor2web ([https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/tor2web be careful]).</ref>
* Installation of any software package possible. <ref>{{note}} Must be able to run on Debian GNU/Linux or you can use [[Other Operating Systems]]. See also [[Install Software|Software installation on Whonix-Workstation]] for details.</ref> <ref>{{note}} ICMP, ping, VOIP calls over UDP, etc...</ref> <ref>{{note}} Skype over TCP does work, but it is not recommended, because it is proprietary, closed source and there is no control over the encryption keys. Skype authority can compromise you out any moment. A secure encryption/authentication design looks different. For example GPG and OTR are secure, because the user has control over the keys, not the server. See [[Voip#...|Voip Skype section]] for details.</ref> <ref>{{note}} [[Tunnel UDP over Tor]]</ref>
* Safe hosting of [[Hidden Services]] possible. <ref>{{note}} Even if someone hacks your hidden server software (lighttpd, thttpd, apache, etc.), he can not steal your hidden service key. The key is stored on the Whonix-Gateway. Once you cleaned your Whonix-Workstation, no one can impersonate your hidden service anymore.</ref> <ref>{{note}} The Workstation is the place where the browser, IRC client and so on is running. The Gateway is the place where Tor and the firewall is running.</ref>
* Protection against side channel attacks, no IP or DNS leaks possible. <ref>{{note}} Whonix protects against IP and DNS leaks. Other possible leaks (such as username; time zone; etc.) and how to mitigate them see [[Documentation]]. Additionally Whonix's [[Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection]] mitigates many possible fingerprinting attacks by using common, non-identifying defaults. (username set to user; timezone set to UTC; etc.) </ref>
* Advantage over Live CD's: Tor's data directory is still available after reboot, due to persistent storage. Tor requires persistent storage to save its Entry Guards <ref>https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#EntryGuards</ref>.

* Java / JavaScript <ref>{{note}} There is no difference compared to using JavaScript directly within Tor Browser.</ref> <ref>Of course JavaScript within Tor Browser inside Whonix will also not leak your IP. Browser fingerprinting still applies. For more information see [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/WebBrowsers Web-browser]!</ref> / flash / [[Browser Plugins]] <ref>{{note}} This is still not recommended as they may decrease anonymity (e.g. flash cookies) and often have security vulnerabilities. Most popular plugins are closed source. See [[Browser Plugins]] for more information.</ref> / misconfigured applications cannot leak your real external IP. See [[Security in Real World]].
* Protection against IP/location discovery through root exploits (Malware <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware</ref> with root rights) inside Whonix-Workstation. But you should really not test it <ref>{{note}} In case Whonix-Workstation gets rooted, the adversary can not find out the users real IP/location. This is because Whonix-Workstation can only connect through the Whonix-Gateway. How difficult is it to compromise Whonix? See [[Comparison with Others#Attacks|Attack Comparison Matrix]] and [[Design]]. More skill is required.</ref>

* Uses only Free Software <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software</ref>.
* Building Whonix from source is easy, see [[Dev/Build Documentation]].
* Tor <ref>https://www.torproject.org</ref> + Vidalia <ref>https://www.torproject.org/projects/vidalia.html.en</ref> and Tor Browser <ref>https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en</ref> are not running inside the same machine. That means that for example an exploit in the browser can't affect the integrity of the Tor process. <ref>{{note}} [[Vidalia]] is optional; [[Tor Controller|arm]] is installed as alternative.</ref>
* It is possible to use Whonix in conjunction with VPNs, ssh and other proxies. But see [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN Tor plus VPN/proxies Warning]. Everything possible, as first chain or last chain, or both.
* Loads of [[Features#Whonix Features|Features]].
* Loads of Optional Configurations (additional features / Add-Ons) available.
* Best possible [[Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection]].
* Private obfuscated [[Bridges]] can be added to {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}.
* Whonix-Gateway can also torify Windows, see [[Other Operating Systems]].

= Disadvantages of Whonix =
* More difficult to set up compared to the regular Tor Browser.
* Needs virtual machines or spare hardware.
* Updating OS and applications behind the Tor proxy is slow.
* Higher maintenance required. <ref>{{note}} You need to maintain three instead of one OS. You need to remember several passwords and update at least three systems.</ref>
