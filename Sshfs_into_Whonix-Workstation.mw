{{mbox

| text    = Only complete these steps once.
}}

== Add Membership ==

Perform these steps on the host.

If you are not already a member of the fuse group, add yourself.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo adduser `whoami` fuse
}}

If you were not already a member, this message will appear.

<pre>
Adding user `user' to group `fuse' ...
Adding user user to group fuse
Done.
</pre>

And should reboot. <ref>If not, restarting X may also work.</ref>

If this message appears.

<pre>
The user `user' is already a member of `fuse'.
</pre>

Then you are already a member of the fuse group and do not have to reboot.

== Import {{project_name}} VMs ==

Perform these steps on the host.

* import {{gateway_product_name}}
* import {{workstation_product_name}}

== Modify the {{gateway_product_name}} VM ==

Perform this step on the host.

Be careful if you did not name your VM "{{gateway_product_name_short}}"!

{{CodeSelect|code=
VBoxManage modifyvm "{{gateway_product_name_short}}" --natpf1 "ssh",tcp,127.0.0.1,2200,,22 ; echo $?
}}

If there is an error, the following message will appear.

<pre>
VBoxManage: error: The machine '{{gateway_product_name_short}}8.1' is already locked for a session (or being unlocked)
VBoxManage: error: Details: code VBOX_E_INVALID_OBJECT_STATE (0x80bb0007), component Machine, interface IMachine, callee nsISupports
Context: "LockMachine(a&rarr;session, LockType_Write)" at line 377 of file VBoxManageModifyVM.cpp
1
</pre>

If the procedure is successful, the following message will appear.

<pre>
0
</pre>

== Update and Install OpenSSH ==

Perform these steps on both {{gateway_product_name}} <u>and</u> {{workstation_product_name}}.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
}}

== Open Ports ==

Perform these steps on both {{gateway_product_name}} <u>and</u> {{workstation_product_name}}.

{{CodeSelect|code=
echo 'EXTERNAL_OPEN_PORTS+=" 22 "' {{!}} sudo tee -a "/etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_user.conf"
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo whonix_firewall
}}

== Open an SSH Connection ==

Perform these steps on {{gateway_product_name}}.

{{CodeSelect|code=
ssh.anondist-orig 10.152.152.11
}}

Yes (accept fingerprint).

Terminate the SSH connection.

{{CodeSelect|code=
exit
}}

== Troubleshooting ==

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = If SSH is used on the host for other purposes, it might be better to switch to an extra user.
}}

If necessary, these steps should be performed on the host.

Try the following if you experience problems. This might not be necessary; so <u>think first</u>!

{{CodeSelect|code=
killall ssh
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
killall sshfs
}}

There also seems to be a bug with existing SSH known_hosts files; try these steps if you experience problems. This might not be necessary; so <u>think first</u>!

The "rm" command can be used instead if you know what you are doing.

{{CodeSelect|code=
trash-put ~/.ssh/known_hosts
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
trash-put ~/.ssh/known_hosts.old
}}

Or.

{{CodeSelect|code=
#rm ~/.ssh/known_hosts
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
#rm ~/.ssh/known_hosts.old
}}

== Create Necessary Folders ==

Perform this step on the host.

{{CodeSelect|code=
mkdir ~/mountworkstation
}}

== SSHFS into {{workstation_product_name}} ==

Perform these steps on the host.

{{CodeSelect|code=
ssh -f user@127.0.0.1 -p 2200 -L 2222:10.152.152.11 :22 -N
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sshfs -p 2222 user@127.0.0.1:/ ~/mountworkstation
}}
