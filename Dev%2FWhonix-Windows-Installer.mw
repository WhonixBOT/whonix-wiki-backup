= Introduction =

The {{project_name}}-Windows-Installer for Windows is a simple and fast way to set-up {{project name}} on a system running Microsoft Windows.

[[File:210px-Download_Button.svg.png|center|link=Windows_Quick_Start|250px|alt=Download {{project_name}}]]

{{Anchor|Rationale}}
The {{project name}} Windows Installer was developed with a focus on providing users with an fast and easy method to install {{project name}} in Microsoft Windows. This gives users the opportunity to experiment with {{project name}} in a familiar environment without the necessity of complex virtual machine imports or host operating system changes. When the <code>whonix-installer.exe</code> is executed, the latest VirtualBox version and both {{project name}} VMs are seamlessly installed on the Windows machine. From there, users can immediately start using {{project name}} with no further configuration required.<ref>While no further action is required to install or configure the {{project name}} VMs, it is ''possible'' (in some cases) that host bios settings or workarounds for VirtualBox bugs will require user intervention. These are <u>not</u> {{project name}} issues.</ref>

== Requirements ==
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' The {{project_name}} VirtualBox XFCE ova found here: [[VirtualBox/XFCE]] <ref>
[[VirtualBox/CLI]] is [[unsupported]].</ref>

'''2.''' The newest build of the VirtualBox-Installer found here under <code>Windows hosts</code>: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads?replytocom=98578

'''3.''' <code>7zSD.sfx</code> which you may obtain under <code>7-Zip 9.20 Extra</code> here: http://www.7-zip.org/download.html

 You need to download the <code>.7z</code> compressed archive file and extract it.

'''5.''' The newest version of Inno Setup Unicode, a tool for easily creating installers, found here: http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php

'''7.''' The Source for the installer, the logo, the license text, configuration files and the batch file handling the compilation, found here: https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/{{project_name_short}}-Windows-Installer
}}
== File Preparation ==

Note: All commands must be run from the folder containing the corresponding file(s).
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Install Inno Setup Unicode on your system.
<br>
'''2.''' The VirtualBox-Installer <code>.exe</code> must be taken "apart". 

This is necessary because the <code>.exe</code> contains the Microsoft Software Installation (<code>.msi</code>) based Installers for x64 systems, as well as a compressed <code>.cab</code> file. 

To separate these files, run the following at the Windows command prompt.

{{CodeSelect|code=
VirtualBox[Characters based on your version].exe -extract
}}

When completed, a window will open with the destination folder and the following files (<code>VirtualBox[Characters based on your version]amd64.msi</code>, <code>common.cab</code>) which have been extracted.
<br>
'''3.''' Rename <code>VirtualBox[Characters based on your version]amd64.msi</code> to <code>virtualbox_x64.msi</code>. 

At the Windows command prompt, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
move VirtualBox[Characters based on your version]and64.msi virtualbox_x64.msi
}}

All files must be located in the same folder for the {{project_name}} Windows Installer build. Choose a folder and move all files to this folder as preparation continues.

'''4.''' Move the stable {{project_name}} ova image [[VirtualBox/XFCE]] to the folder and rename it to <code>whonix.ova</code>. 

{{CodeSelect|code=
move {{project_name_short}}-XFCE-{{VersionNew}}.ova C:\path\to\your_build_folder\whonix.ova
}}

'''5.''' Move the source files (<code>{{project_name_short}}.iss</code>, <code>logo.ico</code>, <code>license.txt</code>, <code>MakeInstaller.bat</code>, <code>config.txt</code>) to the build folder.

{{CodeSelect|code=
move <your_source_file> C:\path\to\your_build_folder\
}}

'''6.''' Finally, move {{project_name}}-Windows-User-Interface (<code>{{project_name_short}}.exe</code>), <code>7zSD.sfx</code> and <code>7za.exe</code> to the build folder.

{{CodeSelect|code=
move <your_file> C:\path\to\your_build_folder\
}}

You should now have the following files in the build folder:

* <code>{{project_name_short}}.exe</code>
* <code>virtualbox_x64.msi</code>
* <code>common.cab</code>
* <code>whonix.ova</code>
* <code>{{project_name_short}}.iss</code>
* <code>logo.ico</code>
* <code>license.txt</code>
* <code>7zSD.sfx</code>
* <code>7za.exe</code>
* <code>MakeInstaller.bat</code>
* <code>config.txt</code>

The preparation step is finished and the Installer can now be built.

== Building ==

Building the installer itself is very easy once everything has been properly set up -- just launch the <code>MakeInstaller.bat</code> file. The compilation via InnoSetup, the packaging and the combination of all files via 7-Zip, as well as any other required steps are handled automatically. The end result is the named <code>whonix-installer.exe</code> file.

This concludes the guide to building the {{project_name}}-Installer for Windows from source.

= New Instructions Draft = 
= Building from source =

== Preparation ==

Download a copy of this repository. Use its folder to collect required files for building.
 https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix-Windows-Installer
Download the Whonix VirtualBox XFCE image to the folder and renamed it to "whonix.ova"
 https://www.whonix.org/wiki/VirtualBox/XFCE
Download and install Inno Setup
 http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php
Whonix-UI executable in the folder
 Built from source: https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Building_Whonix-UI_for_Windows
Download the newest "Windows hosts" VirtualBox installer to any location. 
 https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
Navigate in the commandline to that location and run 
{{CodeSelect|code=
VirtualBox[Characters based on your version].exe -extract
}}
A window will open telling you where its files have been extracted. Navigate to this folder, rename "VirtualBox[Characters based on your version]amd64.msi" to "virtualbox_x64.msi" and move it to the repository/build folder.

== Building ==

Your build folder should have at least:

* <code>license.txt</code>
* <code>logo.ico</code>
* <code>virtualbox_x64.msi</code>
* <code>Whonix.exe</code>
* <code>Whonix.iss</code>
* <code>whonix.ova</code>

Optional: Open Whonix.iss and change AppVersion. Set Compression as desired (https://documentation.help/Inno-Setup/topic_setup_compression.htm)


Right-click Whonix.iss and select "Compile" (Or inside Inno Setup select Build -> Compile). The executable is in <code>Output</code>.


Note: If OVA becomes greater than 2GB, Whonix.iss must be set to use DiskSpanning=Yes. This will output an exe and .bin file. To combine, add <code>7za.exe</code> and <code>7zSD.sfx</code> to the 7zip folder. Open <code>7zip/make self extract.bat</code>, which combines everything in Output into a 7z archive and then into a self-extracting-and-running exe.

== Obtaining 7zSD.sfx and 7za.exe ==
 http://www.7-zip.org/download.html

<code>7zSD.sfx</code>
Download the 7-zip compressed archive file and extract it.

<br>

[[Image:windows_installer_7zSD-sfx.png]]
<br>

<code>7za.exe</code>
Download the <code>.7z</code> compressed archive file under <code>7-Zip 16.04 Extra</code> and extract it.
