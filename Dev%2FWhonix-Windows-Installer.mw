= Introduction =

The {{project_name}}-Windows-Installer for Windows is a simple and fast way to set-up {{project name}} on a system running Microsoft Windows.

[[File:210px-Download_Button.svg.png|center|link=Windows_Quick_Start|250px|alt=Download {{project_name}}]]

{{Anchor|Rationale}}
The {{project name}} Windows Installer was developed with a focus on providing users with an fast and easy method to install {{project name}} in Microsoft Windows. This gives users the opportunity to experiment with {{project name}} in a familiar environment without the necessity of complex virtual machine imports or host operating system changes. When the <code>whonix-installer.exe</code> is executed, the latest VirtualBox version and both {{project name}} VMs are seamlessly installed on the Windows machine. From there, users can immediately start using {{project name}} with no further configuration required.<ref>While no further action is required to install or configure the {{project name}} VMs, it is ''possible'' (in some cases) that host bios settings or workarounds for VirtualBox bugs will require user intervention. These are <u>not</u> {{project name}} issues.</ref>

= Building from source =

== Preparation ==

Download a copy of this repository. Use its folder to collect required files for building.
 https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix-Windows-Installer
Download the Whonix VirtualBox XFCE image to the folder and renamed it to "whonix.ova"
 https://www.whonix.org/wiki/VirtualBox/XFCE
Download and install Inno Setup
 http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php
Whonix-UI executable in the folder
 Built from source: https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Building_Whonix-UI_for_Windows
Download the newest "Windows hosts" VirtualBox installer to any location. 
 https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
Navigate in the commandline to that location and run 
{{CodeSelect|code=
VirtualBox[Characters based on your version].exe -extract
}}
A window will open telling you where its files have been extracted. Navigate to this folder, rename <code>VirtualBox</code><code>[Characters based on your version]</code><code>amd64.msi</code> to <code>virtualbox_x64.msi</code> and move it to the repository/build folder.

== Building ==

Your build folder should have at least:

* <code>license.txt</code>
* <code>logo.ico</code>
* <code>virtualbox_x64.msi</code>
* <code>Whonix.exe</code>
* <code>Whonix.iss</code>
* <code>whonix.ova</code>

Optional: Open <code>Whonix.iss</code> and change <code>AppVersion</code>. Set <code>Compression</code> as desired (https://documentation.help/Inno-Setup/topic_setup_compression.htm)

Right-click <code>Whonix.iss</code> and select <code>Compile</code> (Or inside Inno Setup select <code>Build</code> &rarr; <code>Compile</code>). The executable is in <code>Output</code>.

Note: If the <code>.ova</code> becomes greater than 2GB, <code>Whonix.iss</code> must be set to use <code>DiskSpanning=Yes</code>. This will output an <code>.exe</code> and <code>.bin</code> file. To combine, add <code>7za.exe</code> and <code>7zSD.sfx</code> to the 7zip folder. Open <code>7zip/make self extract.bat</code>, which combines everything in <code>Output</code> into a <code>.7z</code> archive and then into a self-extracting-and-running <code>.exe</code>.

== Obtaining 7zSD.sfx and 7za.exe ==
 http://www.7-zip.org/download.html

<code>7zSD.sfx</code>
Download the 7-zip compressed archive file and extract it.

<br>

<code>7za.exe</code>
Download the <code>.7z</code> compressed archive file under <code>7-Zip 16.04 Extra</code> and extract it.
