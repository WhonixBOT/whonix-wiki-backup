The Tor Project [https://web.archive.org/web/20201005155217/https://blog.torproject.org/tor-heart-whonix wrote]:

<blockquote>
UPDATE, AUGUST 2020 - Since the writing of this blog post, the Tor Project Community has become increasingly concerned by reports of a pattern of tolerance for sexism, racism, and other bigotry within the Whonix community. Therefore, we can no longer endorse Whonix, and do not encourage others to get involved with them. We want to foster a diverse, inclusive, and welcoming environment for all and we feel that associating with Whonix jeopardizes these goals.
</blockquote>

The Whonix Project reply:

<blockquote>
These are surprisingly vague, strong and broad accusations. Do you consider this appropriate?

If there is no substance, a retraction would be appreciated. Otherwise, if there is substance, could you please be more specific?

How many reports?

What specific incidents of sexism?

What specific incidents of racism?

What specific incidents of bigotry?

Responses will be published for sake of transparency. Verifiable details of specific incidents and victims will be appropriately redacted, however.

No clarification was provided despite two e-mails asking the Tor Project Executive Director (Isabela Bagueros) and one e-mail to the Tor Project Board of Directors (Bruce Schneier, Chelsea Komlo, Cindy Cohn, Gabriella Coleman, Julius Mittenzwei, Matt Blaze, Nighat Dad, Rabbi Rob Thomas, Ramy Raoof) asking for a response and sufficient time provided for this purpose. 

{{project_name}} unreservedly rejects these wild and unfounded accusations aimed at the project. In short, {{project_name}} developers are willing to admit mistakes when we get something wrong, but none of these claims have any merit whatsoever. For around a decade, {{project_name}} has developed the platform to protect the inalienable right to privacy for all users and has not once discriminated against any individual on the basis of race, gender, religion or sexual orientation. For this reason, we would like to take this opportunity to correct the record.

{{project_name}} notes that edits to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20180625051536/https://blog.torproject.org/tor-heart-whonix Tor at the Heart: Whonix] Tor project post were made soon after an article by Micah Lee on June 22, 2020 entitled [https://micahflee.com/2020/06/is-the-whonix-project-run-by-fascists/ Is the Whonix project run by fascists?]. In that article, Micah insinuated that {{project_name}} may hold white supremacist sympathies merely because an account had been created on the Gab social network. Those claims were thoroughly debunked on this [https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-is-loosing-their-antifacist-supporters/9844 forum thread] -- most importantly, it was highlighted the primary criteria for [[Official_Whonix_Online_Profiles#Selection_of_Platforms|Official {{project_name}} Online Profiles]] is simply that it must be somewhat popular, legal and allow easy sign-up. {{project_name}} account creation has never signified endorsement of a particular network or its political leanings, but instead is focused on reserving the {{project_name}} account name (among many other reasons). Put simply, other ethical or political considerations are irrelevant criteria.

The logical assumption is Micah's groundless accusations have influenced The Tor Project to update their blog post concerning {{project_name}}. Their unwillingness to retract this edit represents a senseless attack and helps to spread fear, uncertainty and doubt ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty,_and_doubt FUD]). Any cursory examination of {{project_name}} posts on official media channels, forums or other infrastructure would quickly dispel the repugnant claims of racism, sexism and bigotry. In fact, the {{project_name}} project is not aware of a single instance that would give credence to these claims in around a decade of operation. This is an extremely disappointing outcome since The Tor Project supposedly upholds values of tolerance and  cooperation, while generally being welcoming to other developers and projects in the privacy community.

{{project_name}} holds out hope The Tor Project will uphold more professional conduct on their behalf and remove the defamatory claims in the near term, particularly since the specific accusations crumble when subjected to scrutiny. By letting this falsehood stand, they do a great disservice to users of the Tor network since {{project_name}} undoubtedly provides greater protections against potential deanonymization than Tor Browser in isolation, and has been promoted by vocal and influential rights campaigners like Edward Snowden.

In the end calculation this vicious smear is insignificant for {{project_name}} users. {{project_name}} developers and maintainers will not allow petty squabbles to interfere with the primary goal -- providing utmost protection for user freedoms and safety. Our only concern is to continue work on creating and providing software that is the best in its class. Unbalanced claims and false accusations that seek to harm the reputation of {{project_name}} are sadly representative of a toxic culture that has infested the community in recent years, but this miscarriage of justice will not impede our mission. 

This page was created in order to document and publicly reply to these accusations. If there are any major changes to this page, the version number at the top will be adjusted.

Hello Isabela,

in an old Tor Project blog post [1] an anonymous editor recently
inserted, quote:

> the Tor Project Community has become increasingly concerned by reports
of a pattern of tolerance for sexism, racism, and other bigotry within
the Whonix community.

These are surprisingly vague, strong and broad accusations. As the
executive director of The Tor Project, do you consider this appropriate?

If there is no substance, a quiet retraction would be appreciated.
Otherwise, if there is substance, could you please be more specific
either in the blog post or by e-mail?

How many reports?

What specific incidents of sexism?

What specific incidents of racism?

What specific incidents of bigotry?

In case this statement is not retracted, I will publicly publish
responses for sake of transparency. Verifiable details of specific
incidents and victims will be appropriately redacted, however.

Kind regards,
Patrick Schleizer

Dear Tor Project Board of Directors,

I am the Whonix OS lead developer and I have contacted the Tor Project
Executive Director 1 month ago with the message below regarding
defamatory statements made about my project on one of Tor Project blog
posts. [1]

Please kindly oversee the matter and decide if this type of conduct -
making vague, broad accusations and ignoring requests for clarification
- is acceptable.

Kind regards,
Patrick
