The Tor Project [https://web.archive.org/web/20201005155217/https://blog.torproject.org/tor-heart-whonix wrote]:

<blockquote>
UPDATE, AUGUST 2020 - Since the writing of this blog post, the Tor Project Community has become increasingly concerned by reports of a pattern of tolerance for sexism, racism, and other bigotry within the Whonix community. Therefore, we can no longer endorse Whonix, and do not encourage others to get involved with them. We want to foster a diverse, inclusive, and welcoming environment for all and we feel that associating with Whonix jeopardizes these goals.
</blockquote>

The Whonix Project reply:

<blockquote>
These are surprisingly vague, strong and broad accusations. Do you consider this appropriate?

If there is no substance, a retraction would be appreciated. Otherwise, if there is substance, could you please be more specific?

How many reports?

What specific incidents of sexism?

What specific incidents of racism?

What specific incidents of bigotry?

Responses will be published for sake of transparency. Verifiable details of specific incidents and victims will be appropriately redacted, however.
</blockquote>

No clarification was provided despite 2 e-mails asking the Tor Project Executive Director (Isabela Bagueros) and 1 e-mail to the Tor Project Board of Directors (Bruce Schneier, Chelsea Komlo, Cindy Cohn, Gabriella Coleman, Julius Mittenzwei, Matt Blaze, Nighat Dad, Rabbi Rob Thomas, Ramy Raoof) giving them sufficient time for a response.

We therefore conclude they are OK with senselessly attacking others and spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty,_and_doubt FUD]) despite supposedly upholding values of tolerance, cooperation and being welcoming to other developers and projects in the privacy community. Maybe more professional conduct on their part was too much to expect when looking at their past actions when mediating conflict within their own project.

What does it mean for users? Nothing whatsoever. We don't let petty squabbles get in the way of protecting others freedom and safety. Our only concern is to work on creating and providing best in class software without all the virtue signalling and drama that seems to have swamped the community in recent years.

This page was created as to document and make a public reply to these accusations. Should there be major changes to this page, the version number on the top of this page will be increased.

Hello Isabela,

in an old Tor Project blog post [1] an anonymous editor recently
inserted, quote:

> the Tor Project Community has become increasingly concerned by reports
of a pattern of tolerance for sexism, racism, and other bigotry within
the Whonix community.

These are surprisingly vague, strong and broad accusations. As the
executive director of The Tor Project, do you consider this appropriate?

If there is no substance, a quiet retraction would be appreciated.
Otherwise, if there is substance, could you please be more specific
either in the blog post or by e-mail?

How many reports?

What specific incidents of sexism?

What specific incidents of racism?

What specific incidents of bigotry?

In case this statement is not retracted, I will publicly publish
responses for sake of transparency. Verifiable details of specific
incidents and victims will be appropriately redacted, however.

Kind regards,
Patrick Schleizer

Hello,

I contacted the Tor Project Executive Director 14 days ago with the
message below. For the 8 years I have known this community, I have never
asked for preferential treatment / priority, but in this case please
acknowledge receipt.

Kind regards,
Patrick

Dear Tor Project Board of Directors,

I am the Whonix OS lead developer and I have contacted the Tor Project
Executive Director 1 month ago with the message below regarding
defamatory statements made about my project on one of Tor Project blog
posts. [1]

Please kindly oversee the matter and decide if this type of conduct -
making vague, broad accusations and ignoring requests for clarification
- is acceptable.

Kind regards,
Patrick

Hi all,

Thoughts? I don’t think it’s defamation in the US for a number of reasons but is there a plan to respond?
