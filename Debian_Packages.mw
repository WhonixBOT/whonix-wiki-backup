= Introduction =

It is safe to run <code>sudo apt autoremove</code> so long as the specific {{project name}} machine <code>meta package</code> is kept for the {{non q project name short}} or {{q project name short}} platform. In other words, these packages should <u>not</u> be in the list of autoremoved packages.

[[{{non q project name short}}|{{non q project name}}]] XFCE:

* [[{{gateway_product_name_short}}|{{gateway_product_name}}]]: <code>non-qubes-whonix-gateway-xfce</code>
* [[{{workstation_product_name_short}}|{{workstation_product_name}}]]: <code>non-qubes-whonix-workstation-xfce</code>

[[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]]:

* {{gateway_product_name}}: <code>qubes-whonix-gateway</code>
* {{workstation_product_name}}: <code>qubes-whonix-workstation</code>

= Re-install Meta Packages and Safely Run Autoremove =

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' [[Update]] the package lists.

{{CodeSelect|code=

'''3.''' Auto remove packages.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt autoremove
}}

'''4.''' Reconfirm a proper meta package is still installed.

Repeat step two.

'''5.''' Done.

The procedure of safely running <code>sudo apt autoremove</code> is complete.

= Changed Configuration Files =

Be careful if a message like this appears.

<pre>
Configuration file '/etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.sdwdate'
Configuration file '/etc/apparmor.d/whonix-firewall'
 ==> Modified (by you or by a script) since installation.
 ==> Package distributor has shipped an updated version.
   What would you like to do about it ?  Your options are:
    Y or I  : install the package maintainer's version
    N or O  : keep your currently-installed version
      D     : show the differences between the versions
      Z     : start a shell to examine the situation
 The default action is to keep your current version.

! scope="col"| '''Answer'''
|-

! scope="row"| What is the disadvantage of removing a meta package?
| The disadvantage is any changes in package dependencies will not be automatically processed by the system when it is [[Security_Guide#Updates|upgraded]].

For example the <code>whonix-workstation-packages-recommended-gui</code> meta package depends <ref>
<code>Depends:</code> field in <code>debian/control</code>
</ref> on package <code>[https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/tb-updater tb-updater]</code>. If the <code>whonix-workstation-packages-recommended-gui</code> package is not installed, you would not notice if <code>tb-updater</code> was [https://phabricator.whonix.org/T18 replaced] with package [https://packages.debian.org/torbrowser-launcher <code>torbrowser-launcher</code>]. <code>tb-updater</code> might become unmaintained, broken or even have unfixed security issues. {{project_name}} tries to [[Stay Tuned|keep users up-to-date]] if/when (security relevant) packages are deprecated. If that occurs, you could simply run <code>sudo apt-get purge tb-updater</code> and consider installing what the {{project_name}} meta package recommends as a replacement.

! scope="row"| Which meta packages are safe to remove?
| Use apt-cache to see the package description.

* Replace <code>package-name</code> with the package you intend to install.

{{CodeSelect|code=
apt-cache package-name
}}

It will include either:

* <code>Safe to remove, if you know what you are doing.</code>; or
* <code>Do not remove.</code>

Note the [[#Removal Instructions|Removal Instructions]] below! When that entry is understood, feel free to remove any [[#Non-Issues|desktop specific meta packages]].
|-

! scope="row"| Which packages do {{project_name}} meta packages install?
| Refer to the following files:

* [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/anon-meta-packages/blob/master/debian/control <code>debian/control</code>] in {{project_name}} [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/anon-meta-packages <code>anon-meta-packages</code>] source code folder; and

== Removal Instructions ==

These instructions allow for safe removal of a package (in this example the <code>uwt</code> package). This results in meta package removal without breaking the whole system when next time running <code>sudo apt autoremove</code>.

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Upgrade. 

[[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates|Upgrade the system]].

'''2.''' Clean up.

If custom packages were installed and uninstalled or dependencies changed in the meanwhile, remove unneeded dependencies first.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt autoremove
}}

'''3.''' Uninstall. 

As an example, consider how the [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/uwt {{Code2|uwt}}] package could be uninstalled.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get purge uwt
}}

A message will appear similar to this.

<pre>
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required:
  faketime libfaketime
Use 'sudo apt autoremove' to remove them.
The following packages will be REMOVED:
  qubes-whonix-workstation* uwt* whonix-shared-packages-recommended-cli*
  whonix-workstation-shared-packages-shared-meta*
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 4 to remove and 1 not upgraded.
After this operation, 302 kB disk space will be freed.
Do you want to continue? [Y/n] 
</pre>

'''4.''' Keep packages installed by meta packages. 

Now, there is a small issue:

* Next time the {{Code2|sudo apt autoremove}} command is run, all packages listed under "{{Code2|The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required:}}" would also be uninstalled. (Such as {{Code2|[https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/rads rads]}} and others.)
* In order to keep the other packages which were installed such as by the {{Code2|whonix-workstation-packages-recommended-gui}} and the {{Code2|whonix-shared-packages-recommended-cli}} meta packages, mark them as manually installed so they do not get removed. This can be conveniently achieved with {{Code2|aptitude}}. <ref>
https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/166590/what-is-the-apt-get-equvalent-of-aptitude-keep-all
</ref> <ref>
It is possible to safely mix {{Code2|apt-get}} and {{Code2|aptitude}}. Raphaël Hertzog, dpkg and Debian Developer, stated in 2011 that this is not a problem anymore:

<blockquote>First I want to make it clear that you can use both and mix them without problems. It used to be annoying when apt-get did not track which packages were automatically installed while aptitude did, but now that both packages share this list, there’s no reason to avoid switching back and forth.</blockquote>

Source: [http://raphaelhertzog.com/2011/06/20/apt-get-aptitude-%E2%80%A6-pick-the-right-debian-package-manager-for-you/ apt-get, aptitude, … pick the right Debian package manager for you]
</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo aptitude keep-all
}}

'''5.''' Done. 

The procedure is complete. Be sure to understand the [[#Disadvantage|disadvantage]] of this approach.

Alternatively, there might be a very crude workaround which is discussed in the following forum topic:

== Technical Information ==

{{mbox

| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = This section provides technical information for interested readers and can be skipped.
}}

The underlying technical issues with meta packages are not caused by {{project_name}}, but instead have been inherited from Debian. Those are also described here:

* [https://administratosphere.wordpress.com/2011/11/29/the-metapackage-problem-and-apt-get-autoremove/ The Metapackage Problem and apt autoremove]
* [https://tanguy.ortolo.eu/blog/article8/uninstall-meta-package Uninstalling a single component of a meta-package]
* [https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=942303 Debian bug report: Weak-Depends - something in the middle between 'Recommends:' and 'Depends:']

The Debian manual also provides further information about meta packages:

* [https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/developers-reference/best-pkging-practices.html#bpp-meta Best practices for meta-packages] 

The {{project name}} build script installs all packages using <code>apt --no-install-recommends</code>. <ref>
Function <code>pkg-install-maybe</code> in https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/{{project_name_short}}/blob/master/build-steps.d/1700_install-packages#L97.
</ref> The <code>--no-install-recommends</code> option is being used to prevent installation of many additional packages that are unwanted. For example:
* <code>whonix-workstation-packages-recommended-gui</code> (used to) <code>Depends: gwenview</code>.
* gwenview <code>Recommends: kamera</code>. 
* Without using <code>--no-install-recommends</code>, <code>kamera</code> would also be installed and then pull its own <code>Depends:</code> as well. 
* <code>kamera</code> [+ dependencies] would not be useful to have installed by default on {{workstation_product_name}} as it would cost unnecessary disk space. There are many more examples which could end up installing packages by default that are unrecommended for privacy reasons.

Since the <code>--no-install-recommends</code> option is used, meta packages like <code>whonix-workstation-packages-recommended-gui</code> must use the <code>Depends:</code> field and cannot use the <code>Recommends:</code> field. (Since no packages would be installed then.)

Even if {{project_name}} could and did use the <code>Recommends:</code> field, new packages added to the <code>Recommends:</code> field would not be installed when the meta package that <code>Recommends:</code> them gets upgraded. This is because packages listed after the <code>Recommends:</code> field only get installed during their initial <code>sudo apt install package-name</code> installation.

Some readers might notice that despite this explanation, <code>anon-meta-packages</code>'s <code>debian/control</code> file uses the <code>Recommends:</code> field anyway. This is not a contradiction because it may be useful for a later [[Dev/Installation_from_Repository|{{project_name}} installation from {{project_name}} repository]] use case.
