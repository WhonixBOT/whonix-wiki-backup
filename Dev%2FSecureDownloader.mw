'''Unfinished!'''

= Introduction =
Securing downloads may be better when written as a general purpose tool (not specific to Whonix).

No other projects such as Firefox or Debian support this use case.

= Metalink =
Learning C++ and adding Metalink (including OpenPGP support) into Firefox (see [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/21 Metalink], see https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=331979) might be one of the simpler, yet very difficult approaches. For Firefox, gsoc may be way to get this feature in, which means that some uber geek spends 4 months full time on developing this. (While still not addressing the TUF threat model.)

= Open Questions =
* How to download and verify the host program in the first place?
* How to download the secure downloader itself in censored countries?
* How to download files in censored countries?
* Torify downloads?

= Difficulties =
Such a host program is host operating system specific, well you can write it in a cross platform language but still have to struggle with platform specific quirks.

The Tor Project never managed to get such a downloader up and running, see {{Code|Thandy}}.
