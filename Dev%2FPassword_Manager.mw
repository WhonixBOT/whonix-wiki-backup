= Discussion =

These are update notes on the password manager choices covered as of 2016:

'''Candidates:'''

* Bruce Schneier's passwordsafe is a good replacement. Its only available in Stretch and Sid.
** https://packages.debian.org/sid/utils/passwordsafe
** https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/09/security_of_pas.html


'''Excluded options:'''

* KeePass 2 use not recommended because of their hostile stance against user security. <ref>KeePass 2's reaction to a MITM bug report against its Update Check:

[http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2016/Jun/24 8.2.2016 @ 15:45: Received response from Dominik Reichl: The vulnerability will not be fixed. The indirect costs of switching to HTTPS (like lost advertisement revenue) make it a inviable solution.]</ref>

* fpm2 was removed from Debian because its upstream development is dead.<ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/add-password-manager-by-default/189/21</ref>
