}}
[[Image:Thunderbird_17.0.png|400px|thumb|Mozilla Thunderbird (called Icedove in Debian) with TorBirdy]]
= Introduction =

You can either use [[#Webmail|Webmail]] through [[Tor Browser]] or [[#Mozilla Thunderbird with TorBirdy|Mozilla Thunderbird with TorBirdy]].

None of the solutions is perfect. This is not a Whonix related issue. It is a general issue with e-mail over Tor.

= Threats =

It is often recommended to use mail encryption (enigmail). Yes, that's good. Use it. Remember, as stated on the [[Warning]] page, subjects are always unencrypted. That's not everything however.

Registering the e-mail address anonymously, i.e. not entering personal data and only accessing it over Tor is a sure thing.

If you have a website or other kind of project, you must publish your e-mail address so others can write.

The e-mail provider is always a single point of failure. If the provider gets pressured, forced or decides not to like your opinion anymore or feels like terminating the service for everyone, the e-mail account can be easily terminated in seconds. This can significantly slow down correspondence. Therefore it's always good to have a few backup e-mail address and alternative communication channels.

Even if subjects are random, hidden, -, empty or misleading and the content is encrypted, the e-mail provider can still log valuable data. When you logged in, how long, how often you fetch mail, how fast you type <ref name=javascript>Only with javascript-enabled webmail.</ref>, how long you read a message <ref name=javascript />, which spelling mistakes you make and correct <ref name=javascript />, to which address mails are sent, when you receive mails, from which addresses and when. That's quite a lot metadata, which may lead into (false) assumptions by an adversary.

= Encryption =

E-mail encryption is recommended. Mastering e-mail encryption isn't hard, but involves a learning curve. It's outside the scope of this guide, see external documentation.

KGpg <ref>[http://utils.kde.org/projects/kgpg/ KGpg Homepage], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KGPG KGpg wiki with screenshot]</ref> and GnuPG are pre-installed.

= Webmail =

Many webmail services require JavaScript, display web bugs and you must be careful when receiving attachments.

'''TODO''': Expand.

= Icedove (Mozilla Thunderbird) with Enigmail + TorBirdy =

[[Image:Thunderbird_17.0.png|400px|thumb|Mozilla Thunderbird (called Icedove in Debian) with TorBirdy]]

Mozilla Thunderbird (called Icedove in Debian) together with Enigmail and TorBirdy<ref>[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/torbirdy TorBirdy Homepage]</ref> <ref>[https://github.com/ioerror/torbirdy TorBirdy Source Code]</ref> add-ons can be used for easy GPG encryption and anonymous (or pseudonymous) e-mail. TorBirdy is an equivalent of TorButton

Follow these steps on your Whonix-Workstation.

1. Install Icedove, Enigmail and TorBirdy:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install icedove enigmail xul-ext-torbirdy
</pre>

2. To fetch contacts' GPG keys from the key server open '''KGpg''' and go to '''Key Server Dialog'''. Search for email addresses you want to communicate with and import the keys.

3. There are no proxy settings required <ref>For [[Stream Isolation]].</ref>, because since TorBirdy 0.1.0, TorBirdy natively supports Whonix.<ref>TorBirdy sets Socks Host to 10.152.152.10 and Port to 9102, if the WHONIX variable is set, which is the default in /etc/environment since Whonix 0.5.5.</ref>

4. Enigmail's recommended setting.

https://phabricator.whonix.org/file/data/wk2yrtxoac6figswi3ut/PHID-FILE-3ubbh4zagbi3lavfas4w/enigmail_secure_settings.png

{{Anchor|keyserver}}
'''Keyserver'''

To interact with keyservers, you have two options.

* a) gpg command line: You can use it as usual.
* b) Enigmail's keyserver interaction features.
** Will not work out of the box. <ref>
[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/torbirdy#EnigmailOpenPGPGPGforThunderbird It has been made fail closed by TorBirdy developers], otherwise there could be a DNS leak in setups not using Whonix.
</ref> <ref>
proposal on how to make keyservers in Enigmail in Whonix work out of the box: [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/17533 do not use keyserver-options in Whonix]
</ref>
** You need to apply the following setting <u>every time you restart icedove</u>. <ref>
upstream bug report: [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/13430 Can't set custom http-proxy on GnuPG-settings, lost after restart]
</ref> (Minor security notice: <ref>
It will not be perfectly [[Stream Isolation|stream isolated]]. DNS might go through Tor's TransPort.

If this matters to you, you could theoretically... '''UNTESTED'''

* Install a http to socks converter (such as polipo) listening on 127.0.0.1:8118 and forwarding to <Whonix-Gateway IP>:9102.
* Apply the following setting <u>every time you restart icedove</u>.

Icedove -> Enigmail (from menu bar) -> Preferences -> Display Expert Settings and Menus -> Advanced -> Additional Parameters -> replace <code>http-proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8118</code> with <code>socks5://<Whonix-Gateway IP>:9102</code> -> OK
</ref>)

Icedove -> Enigmail (from menu bar) -> Preferences -> Display Expert Settings and Menus -> Advanced -> Additional Parameters -> remove the following part <code>--keyserver-options http-proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8118</code> -> OK

'''High-Security Precautions'''

There have been bugs in email clients and Enigmail that lead to auto-saving of drafts as plaintext. <ref>https://tails.boum.org/security/claws_mail_leaks_plaintext_to_imap/index.en.html</ref><ref>http://sourceforge.net/p/enigmail/bugs/502</ref> If you are in a life critical situation you may want to encrypt your emails in such a way as to not risk leaks.

1. Open ''KGpg'' and select the recipient key (if more than one then hold CTRL while clicking).

2.  Go to: ''File -> Open Editor''  and write your message.

3. Encrypt message to ciphertext by clicking on the ''Encrypt'' lock icon and choose your private key in the prompt that comes up and ''OK''.

4. Copy the ciphertext into the email client and send it as you would normally (don't include subject lines - those are not encrypted).

= Remailer - Sending e-mails without registration =

See [[Remailer]].

= E-Mail Provider Comparison =

== Introduction ==
It has been asked whether I2Pmail is safer than tormail, riseup, gmail and so on. The ''Threats'' chapter above states "''e-mail is always a single point of failure''". It doesn't really matter, apart from privacy by policy, no e-mail provider can significantly improve privacy by design. The most important thing about e-mail providers you should ask about e-mail providers is: Will they tolerate me signing up by Tor and exclusively using the e-mail service over Tor? Will they suspend my e-mail account because I speak against someone and they get forced to suspend my account? The latter question applies more, if you run a project, movement or something like that and less for accounts, which barely anyone knows.

Other than privacy by design, privacy by policy is always a weak protection. An exception might be services, which are not classical e-mail and therefore incompatible, but e-mail alike services such as Usenet (see below), I2P-Bote (see below), RetroShare or TorChat (See [[Chat]]).

A few frequently discussed mail providers are described above with some facts. There is no recommendation for or against any mail providers.

== tormail.org ==
<s>
* Not affiliated with The Tor Project.
* Rumors about being hosted by a secret service. It doesn't really matter, you shouldn't trust mail providers anyway. Assume, anything they can log, they will log forever.
* They technically can not even store Tor exit IP addresses (perhaps mail clients without TorBirdy, put aside) because it's a hidden service.
* Does not work reliable for mailing lists. After a while the user gets unsubscribed because tormail bounces too many mails.
* We haven't heard about any e-mail accounts which got suspended. (Well, we don't know about spam abuse, but that's another story.)
* They are obviously Tor-friendly.
* Things said in the ''Threats'' chapter still apply.
</s>

The Tor Mail service is now offline<ref>http://www.democraticunderground.com/10023403890</ref>, as it was hosted on Freedom Hosting and was taken down by the FBI.<ref>http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/09/freedom-hosting-fbi/</ref>

== I2Pmail.org ==

* Quoted from wikipedia I2P<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I2P</ref>: "''I2P has a free pseudonymous e-mail service run by an individual called Postman. Susimail is a web-based e-mail client intended primarily for use with Postman's mail servers, and is designed with security and anonymity in mind. Susimail was created to address privacy concerns in using these servers directly using traditional email clients, such as leaking the user's hostname while communicating with the SMTP server. It is currently included in the default I2P distribution, and can be accessed through the I2P router console web interface. Mail.I2P can contact both I2P email users, via user@mail.I2P and public internet email users from a user@I2Pmail.org address.''"
* Cleaning the mail header is nice, but TorBirdy can do the same.
* It's technically impossible to encrypt mails to clearnet addresses <ref>Such as gmail, riseup etc.
</ref>, unless the sender and recipient are using end-to-end encryption such as OpenPGP.
* Therefore it's no more/less secure than using riseup, tormail, etc.
* Even though based on I2P, you can still use it in Whonix over Tor, see [[I2P]] for information how to tunnel I2P over Tor.
* We haven't heard about any e-mail accounts which got suspended. (Well, we don't know about spam abuse, but that's another story.)
* Things said in the ''Threats'' chapter still apply.

== I2P-Bote ==

Is not a classical e-mail provider and deserves its own chapter, [[#I2P-Bote|see below]].

== riseup.net ==

* Recommended by Jacob Appelbaum.
* Works reliable on mailing lists.
* Privacy by policy.
* Tor friendly.
* Servers hosted in the US.
* We haven't heard about any e-mail accounts which got suspended. (Well, we don't know about spam abuse, but that's another story.)
* Things said in the ''Threats'' chapter still apply.

== gmail ==

* Mike Hearn from Google addressed this issue on tor-talk<ref>https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-October/025923.html</ref>:

<blockquote>
Access to Google accounts via Tor (or any anonymizing proxy service) is not allowed unless you have established a track record of using those services beforehand. You have several ways to do that:
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
1) With Tor active, log in via the web and answer a security question, if any is presented. You may need to receive a code on your phone. If you don't have a phone number on the account the access may be denied.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
2) Log in via the web without Tor, then activate Tor and log in again WITHOUT clearing cookies. The GAPS cookie on your browser is a large random number that acts as a second factor and will whitelist your access.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Once we see that your account has a track record of being successfully accessed via Tor the security checks are relaxed and you should be able to use TorBirdy.
</blockquote>

* Recommended against. Not Tor friendly. It would be very difficult to sign up using Tor and to exclusively use it over Tor. They most likely ask for phone verification and this is almost impossible to do without jeopardizing anonymity. <ref>Because they are also aware of online phone and messaging services and blacklisting the for verification upon knowledge.</ref>

== Anonymity Friendly E-Mail Provider List ==
Another anonymity network provider (JonDos), maintains a list of their recommended e-mail providers. Whonix developer Patrick Schleizer does NOT check this list. Might still be useful. See [https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/help/email-provider.html list] ([https://archive.today/Rz9UN w]), look for "Recommended Mail Provider".

= Bitmessage =
[https://bitmessage.org Bitmesage] might be another alternative to e-mail. Not yet tested by Whonix developers, because [https://github.com/Bitmessage/PyBitmessage/issues/108 Bitmessage developers do not yet sign their their source code].

= I2P-Bote =

Quoted from wikipedia I2P<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I2P</ref>:

"''I2P-Bote is an I2P-internal, fully decentralized and distributed e-mail system. It supports different identities and does not expose e-mail headers. Currently, it is still alpha software and can only be accessed via its web interface, but POP support is planned. All bote-mails are transparently end-to-end encrypted and, optionally, signed by the sender's public key, thus removing the need for PGP or other privacy software. I2P-Bote offers additional anonymity by allowing for the use of mail relays with variable length delays. As it is decentralized, there is no e-mail server that could link different e-mail identities as communicating with each other (profiling): Even the nodes relaying the mails do not know the sender, and apart from sender and receiver, only the end of the high-latency mail route and the storing nodes will know to whom (which I2P node - the user's IP is still hidden by I2P) the mail is destined. The original sender can have gone offline long before the mail becomes available on the other side.''"

Not yet reviewed by Patrick Schleizer, looks promising.

= Usenet =

== Introduction ==

Interesting parts of Usenet other than discussion, include alt.anonymous.messages, Nym servers and Nym server URL Retrieval.

== alt.anonymous.messages ==
alt.anonymous.messages is a public newsgroups supposed to be used to post encrypted and anonymous messages. Getting anonymity and encrypting the messages is up to the user.

It may sound like a disadvantage, but it's an advantage. In comparison, you can never know how many people are using an e-mail provider. Posting in alt.anonymous.messages everyone knows which messages got posted when, but when done right, no one knows who posted a message and what the content of the message is.

Do not use a web service to read individual messages in alt.anonymous.messages. Use an NNTP client (such as Icedove with TorBirdy). Subscribe to the whole newsgroup and download all messages including headers.

Posting to alt.anonymous.messages can be done using Mixmaster and when it's run inside Whonix-Workstation, it's traffic gets routed through Tor beforehand. See the [[Mixmaster]] article for instructions on using Mixmaster.

Using alt.anonymous.messages could be suspicious by itself, but if you do it right, your adversary may not even know, that you are using it. Since the use of remailer is tunneled through Tor, no one should know, that you are aware of the existence of the remailer network at all.

Further information:

* [[Remailer]]
* [[Mixmaster]]
* [http://www.faqs.org/faqs/privacy/anon-server/faq/use/part7/ Faq]

If you are serious about using it, you should study the work of {{Code2|De-Anonymizing Alt.Anonymous.Messages}} so you can prevent doing that same mistakes.

== Nym server protected e-mail inbox ==

Nym server can illustrated as:

<pre>some@mail.sender sends an mail to alice@nymserver.com

alice@nymserver.com -> mail server A -> mail server B -> ... -> mail server Z -> final@inbox.com</pre>
It's a kind of protection, a proxy chain in front of an e-mail inbox.

Or in other words, a Nym server provides an e-mail address, where incoming mails are forwarded through a configurable chain of mail servers ([[Remailer]]), while not revealing the recipient's inbox to the sender.

This adds several advantages,

* e-mails can be received, while the e-mail provider is protected from pressure or force of an adversary and
* where the e-mail provider doesn't necessarily know, where the e-mail address has been published
* the e-mail provider doesn't know the sender e-mail address and can only see that the recipient became a mail from a remailer

It is my understanding, that the sender's email address will not be known to the recipient, because the remailer will strip it. (Unless the sender specifies it in the text.) However, the one sender of an e-mail is responsible for their own anonymity.

Another question is, if today's remailer really improve security. <ref>See [[Dev/Anonymity Network]] for explanation.</ref>

== Quicksilver Lite in Whonix / creating a Mixmin nym ==
mirimir<ref>http://www.wilderssecurity.com/member.php?u=121604</ref> posted a guide to wilderssecurity.com forum, see [http://www.wilderssecurity.com/showthread.php?p=2210463 Installing Quicksilver Lite in Whonix and creating a Mixmin nym]. If you need help, try asking in that forum thread.

Please note that Whonix developers cannot answer support requests related to Quicksilver. This possibility has just been pointed out and wasn't tested in practice. It's a whole different thing than Whonix and very technical, difficult with many stumble points. Please look for another way, if you need support. Setting up Nym is not Whonix specific. Success stories, use cases, comments, improved documentation etc. however is welcome.

== Nym server URL Retrieval ==

Nym server URL Retrieval is a way to download a web page with high latency and especially when combined with Tor, in theory, safer then Tor alone. In practice, there may be no additional anonymity from today's high latency networks and you could end up being one of the very few people using such, in theory, great services. For explanation about high latency network anonymity see Anonymity Network article<ref>[[Dev/Anonymity Network]].</ref> Further information on the bottom of [http://www.mixnym.net/ mixnym.net].

Further information:

* [http://www.mixnym.net/ Is Not My Name Nymserver]

Please note that, Whonix developer Patrick Schleizer can not answer support requests related to Nym servers. This possibility has just been pointed out and wasn't tested in practice. It's a whole different thing than Whonix and very technical, difficult with many stumble points. Please look for another way, if you need support. Setting up Nym is not Whonix specific. Success stories, use cases, comments, improved documentation etc. however is welcome.

== Discussion ==

Quoted from Usenet Wikipedia<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet</ref>: "''Usenet is a worldwide distributed Internet discussion system.''" The Wikipedia article is worth reading as an introduction.

There are binary groups and non-binary groups. Whonix itself doesn't restrict access to any of those groups. However, the Tor network is banned by some NNTP servers. Binary groups are not covered here, it will be very unlikely to find a free open NNTP server, allowing access to binary groups.

* [https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/news.announce.newusers Usenet FAQ]

== News Reader ==

You can read news groups either using an NNTP client, such as Icedove (+ TorBirdy) or an online reader such as Google Groups. Posting to Usenet using Google Groups is not recommended, it's (almost) impossible or at least very difficult to create an anonymous google account, which is required for posting, because Google requires Tor users to use mobile phone verification, which is not available for anonymous users. Google bans sms to web services as well. I don't know if there are other online hosted NNTP readers, which allow posting for Tor users.

Mixmaster can be used to post to news groups. When it's in Whonix-Workstation following the instructions in the [[Mixmaster]] article, Mixmaster traffic will be even routed through the Tor network.

== NNTP Server ==

An open news server is defined as allowing access to all news discussion groups.

It's difficult to find a free NNTP server even for discussion groups. And no, we are '''not''' looking for a trial. Use search terms like "free NNTP server". The [http://www.nyx.net/~bkraft/ nyx.net list] may be worth checking, I didn't try any of the servers which require registration. Ideally, the news server supports SSL and does not require registration, such as [https://www.aioe.org/ aioe] or is available as a hidden service. I haven't found any news servers hosted as hidden service, they were all down. While aioe allows reading news groups, it does not allow Tor users to post. I haven't found any open news server allowing Tor users to post. (Use Mixmaster over Tor, see above.)

I haven't got NNTPS (SSL encrypted connection to the NNTP server) to work. <code>Maybe it is an upstream bug.</code><ref>https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8069</ref> This shouldn't be of too much concern. Everything posted to newsgroups is open to the public anyway. An encrypted connection to the NNTP server would only prevent Tor exit relays and their ISP's to tamper with the traffic, well, and login data (username and password) for password protected NNTP servers could get stolen. The NNTP server is untrusted in this threat model anyway.
