= Safety Advice =

Be careful what you say! Especially in public places that are archived! What you say may reveal information about you: 

* Location / IP Address
* Personality
* Skills, Aims, Goals
* Personal Details
* Etc.

To keep your IP address hidden, visit these places anonymously over Tor, using either the Whonix-Workstation or the [https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en Tor Browser Bundle] from The Tor Project.

To not link your questions to an existing email or OpenID, use a separate e-mail address, OpenID, and user names just for this purpose.

Be careful with the advice you are getting in public places. Get a second opinion, and do not run commands or perform steps which you do not understand.
