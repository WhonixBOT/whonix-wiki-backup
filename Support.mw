= Safety Advice =
Visit these places anonymously over Tor. Either using [[Tor Browser]] in Whonix-Workstation of if Whonix doesn't work for you yet, get the [https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en Tor Browser Bundle] from The Tor Project.

When asking in public places, be careful with what you are sending, and what it can reveal about yourself:

* location
* IP address
* email subject
* content
* etc.

It might be advisable to get a separate e-mail address and separate account names just for this purpose. Don't use an existing OpenID. Create a new one.

Be careful with the advice you are getting in public places. Do not run commands / steps which you totally do not understand. Always good to cross check if it is sane.
