= Safety Advice =
When asking in public places, be careful with what you are sending, and what it can reveal about yourself:

* location
* IP address
* email subject
* content
* etc.

It might be advisable to get a separate e-mail address and separate account names just for this purpose. Don't use an existing OpenID. Create a new one.
