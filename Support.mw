* When the Tor Browser download script is failing, use the [https://www.whonix.org/forum/ Whonix User Forum]. Since many users are affected when it breaks, there is probably already an existing topic.

* Linux/Debian related questions, are welcomed<ref>http://meta.unix.stackexchange.com/questions/1461/would-you-be-happy-to-welcome-whonix-gnu-linux-users-on-unix-se</ref> on http://unix.stackexchange.com. Add the {{Code2|whonix}} tag, which will alert Whonix developers and followers.

* For general Tor questions not directly related to Whonix (e.g. "What are end-to-end correlation attacks?"), use http://tor.stackexchange.com; the [https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-talk tor-talk mailing list]; or [irc://irc.oftc.net/tor IRC]

* General questions about computer security can be discussed at http://security.stackexchange.com/

* Be careful what you say in public places that are archived!

= Safety Advice =
Visit these places anonymously over Tor. Either using [[Tor Browser]] in Whonix-Workstation of if Whonix doesn't work for you yet, get the [https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en Tor Browser Bundle] from The Tor Project.

When asking in public places, be careful with what you are sending, and what it can reveal about yourself:

* location
* IP address
* email subject
* content
* etc.

It might be advisable to get a separate e-mail address and separate account names just for this purpose. Don't use an existing OpenID. Create a new one.

Be careful with the advice you are getting in public places. Do not run commands / steps which you totally do not understand. Always good to cross check if it is sane.
