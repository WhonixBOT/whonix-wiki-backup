In the first instance, users should search the following free resources for their issue: 

* [[Documentation]]

* When the [[Tor_Browser#Tor_Browser_Downloader_by_Whonix|Tor Browser Downloader]] is failing, use the [https://forums.whonix.org Whonix User Forums]. Since many users are affected when it breaks, there is probably already an existing topic.

* Linux/Debian related questions are welcomed<ref>http://meta.unix.stackexchange.com/questions/1461/would-you-be-happy-to-welcome-whonix-gnu-linux-users-on-unix-se</ref> on http://unix.stackexchange.com. Add the {{Code2|whonix}} tag<ref>http://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/whonix</ref>, which will alert Whonix developers and followers.

* [https://www.qubes-os.org Qubes OS] related questions are welcomed at the [https://www.qubes-os.org/help/ Qubes help resources.] ([https://forums.whonix.org/t/what-to-post-in-this-qubes-whonix-forum-and-what-not What to post in this Qubes-Whonix forum and what not.])

* For general Tor questions not directly related to Whonix like "What are end-to-end correlation attacks?", use http://tor.stackexchange.com; the [https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-talk tor-talk mailing list]; or [irc://irc.oftc.net/tor IRC] ([https://webirc.oftc.net:8443/?channels=Whonix Webchat])

* General questions about computer security can be discussed at http://security.stackexchange.com.

* Whonix-specific Tor questions are welcomed<ref>http://meta.tor.stackexchange.com/questions/119/would-you-be-happy-to-welcome-whonix-gnu-linux-users-on-tor-se</ref> on http://tor.stackexchange.com. Add the {{Code2|whonix}} tag<ref>http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/whonix</ref>, which will alert Whonix developers and followers.

* For Whonix specific questions not suitable for the stackexchange Q/A format, use the [https://forums.whonix.org Whonix User Forum].

{{Anchor|IRC}}
* [irc://irc.oftc.net/whonix #Whonix on irc.oftc.net] ([https://webirc.oftc.net:8443/?channels=Whonix Webchat])

* Help others by [[Contribute#Answer_Questions| subscribing]] to Whonix support channels.

* If an anonymous email address is needed for signing up at [https://forums.whonix.org Whonix User Help Forums], then [[#Creating_an_Anonymous_Email_Account_for_Support|click here]].

== Safety Advice == 
{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text       = '''Warning''': Be careful what you say, especially in public places that are archived!
}}


What is said may reveal personal information such as: 

* Location / IP Address.
* Personality.
* Skills, Aims, Goals.
* Personal Details.
* [...]


To keep the IP address hidden, visit these websites anonymously over Tor, using either the Whonix-Workstation or [https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en Tor Browser] from The Tor Project. To delink questions from an existing email or OpenID, the user should create a separate e-mail address, OpenID, and user name/s just for this purpose.

Be careful with the advice received from public places. Always get a second opinion, and do not run commands or perform steps which you do not understand. Never post any custom code or output that pertains to your system or onion service specifically.

== General Advice == 
{{mbox
| type      = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text       = Tip: Don't accidentally substitute {{Code2|Tor}} for a question related to {{Code2|Tor Browser}}, as this causes confusion. Further, the correct terminology is Tor, not TOR.

== Free Support Principle ==
=== Brief Recommendations ===

It is recommended to follow these steps in order:

# Check the [[Documentation]] to see if the question has already been discussed. Use the Whonix internal search engine, and external search engines (DuckDuckGo, Startpage).
# Search Whonix [https://forums.whonix.org/ forum] and [https://phabricator.whonix.org issue tracker] for the problem. 
# If possible, search for a solution without the Whonix-specific part of the question, as it may have been answered in mainstream Linux fora.
# Check if the problem can be replicated in vanilla operating system environments like [https://www.debian.org/ Debian] stretch, KDE, inside the virtualizer, or over [https://www.torproject.org Tor].
#If the user completes steps 1-4 and is unable to find a similar reference to their problem, then they are eligible to ask for specific support. Suitable options may include Debian user forums, unix stackexchange, VirtualBox forums, KVM mailinglist, Qubes issue tracker, Tor mailing lists, software-specific community / developer forums (for example, LibreOffice), and so forth.
# If no solution is found, the user should create a new post in the Whonix forums.
# If a solution is provided, please consider contributing by editing the Whonix [[Documentation]] and/or providing a complete answer in the [https://forums.whonix.org forums].

=== Free Support Principle Rationale ===

In an ideal world, all free support requests would be answered with minimal to no effort, or systems would run flawlessly, thus negating the need for asking questions. Unfortunately,  real world systems are flawed, and developer time and knowledge is limited.

Whonix will always be free in price as well as in freedom ([[Why_Whonix_is_Free_Software|Why?]]). In order to create a good open source software solution, Whonix has adopted the approach of {{Code2|treating users as co-developers}}. <ref>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar#Lessons_for_creating_good_open_source_software
</ref> This concept is further elaborated below.

'''The User Co-developer Concept'''

The majority of common questions have been answered in the provided [[Documentation]]. If a solution to an issue is already documented, users will usually receive just a link to the documentation in response to their question.

Whonix is a Linux distribution, with Whonix developers and users playing the role of integrators. Whonix itself is based on several components and software distributions developed by other projects; it is standing on the shoulders of giants. 

In simple terms, Whonix is based on: <ref>This is explained in more detail on the [[About]] page.</ref>
* A [[Supported_Platforms|supported platform]] ([https://www.debian.org/ Debian]).
* Two software packages produced by [https://www.torproejct.org The Tor Project (TPO)] - [https://www.torproject.org Tor] and [[Tor Browser]].
* A host of other software packages.


It is impossible for the [[Team|Whonix team]] to be aware of the solution to each and every problem that is encountered. Users are therefore encouraged to first consider if their problem is general, and unspecific to Whonix. 

Putting this principle into action means rephrasing the question, seeking solutions in other arenas, and preferably documenting this solution in the [[Documentation]]. Experience has shown that for some questions, this is the only realistic method to get an answer.

'''Whonix Reliance on Debian'''

{{Based on Debian}}

An example of an inappropriate question seeking Whonix support would be "How do I save a document in Libre Office as a PDF?". The solution is easily found by use of Internet search engines. Even if a solution was difficult to find, LibreOffice would behave identically on Debian and other operating systems. Logically, the recipient for the question should be the LibreOffice community. 

On the other hand, in the unlikely event this hypothetical problem only occurred in Whonix, then it would constitute an appropriate support referral, for example: "I know how to save a document in LibreOffice as a PDF. It doesn't work in Whonix. How can I make it work in Whonix?"

== Creating an Anonymous Email Account for Support ==
Users can try [https://www.anonymousspeech.com/ anonymous speech], [https://www.secure-email.org Secure Email] , or [https://protonirockerxow.onion ProtonMail + Tor]. This is not an endorsement! Users should not trust the providers with any of their personal information, but only use them for creating the forum account.

As a last resort, Patrick or IronSoldier can be contacted on [[#IRC|IRC]] with the desired user name and password. An account can then be created which does not require e-mail verification.
