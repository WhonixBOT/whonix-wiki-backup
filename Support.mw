== Safety Advice == 
Be careful what you say! Especially in public places that are archived! What you say may reveal information about you: 

* Location / IP Address
* Personality
* Skills, Aims, Goals
* Personal Details
* Etc.

To keep your IP address hidden, visit these places anonymously over Tor, using either the Whonix-Workstation or the [https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en Tor Browser Bundle] from The Tor Project. 

To not link your questions to an existing email or OpenID, use a separate e-mail address, OpenID, and user names just for this purpose.

Be careful with the advice you are getting in public places. Get a second opinion, and do not run commands or perform steps which you do not understand.

Never post any custom code that pertains to your system or Hidden Service specifically.

== Free Support Principle ==
<u>Short</u>
* 1) See in [[Documentation]] if your question has already been discussed. Use search engines.
* 2) If possible, please try removing the Whonix specific part of your question.
* 3) Try if the same happens with vanilla [https://www.debian.org/ Debian] jessie [and KDE] [inside your virtualizer] [over [https://www.torproject.org Tor]].
* 4) If yes...
** 4) a) Congratulations! You can access different sources of support. For example Debian user forums, unix stackexchange, VirtualBox forums, KVM mailinglist, Qubes issue tracker, Tor mailing list, community or developers of the specific software you wonder about (for example Libre Office) and so forth.
** 4) b) See if it has been discussed in Whonix's [https://www.whonix.org/old-forum forum] or [https://phabricator.whonix.org issue tracker]. If applicable, create a new post.
* 5) If applicable, please consider contributing your solution back to Whonix's [https://forums.whonix.org forum] and/or [[Documentation]].

<u>Long</u>

In an ideal world, all free support requests would be answered with in layman terms with no future effort. Or even better, it would be so simple, you wouldn't even have to ask questions. Unfortunately, we are not living in an ideal, but the real world. Time and knowledge is limited. Whonix will always be free in price as well as Free as in freedom? ([[Why_Whonix_is_Free_Software|Why?]]) Therefore below the approach of {{Code2|treating your users as co-developers}}<ref>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar#Lessons_for_creating_good_open_source_software
</ref> is elaborated.

For many, and most common questions [[Documentation]] is provided. Should your question be already documented, the only answer you will get is a link to the documentation.

Whonix is a Linux distribution. We are integrators. Whonix is based on several components and software projects developed by other projects. It is standing on the shoulders of giants. For the [[Authorship|Whonix team]] it is impossible to know the answer to each and every question on every part it is based on. Therefore, whenever possible, please consider if your question can be made a general question, unspecific to Whonix. Try removing the Whonix specific part from your question. Try rephrasing it. Try asking it elsewhere. For some types of questions, this is realistically the only way you can get an answer.

As explained in more detail on the [[About]] page, on the most basic view, Whonix is based on a [[Supported_Platforms|supported platform]], [https://www.debian.org/ Debian], two software packages by [https://www.torproejct.org The Tor Project (TPO)], [https://www.torproject.org Tor], and [[Tor Browser]] and many others.

{{Based on Debian}}

For example, a question inappropriate for the Whonix support would be "How do I save a document in Libre Office as PDF?". This is something you can easily find out your self using search engines. And if not, LibreOffice would behave the same on Debian or even any operating system. The recipient for the question should be the LibreOffice community. On the other hand, in the hypothetical (unlikely) case, the following would be a very appropriate one for the Whonix support: "I know how to save a document in LibreOffice as a PDF. It doesn't work in Whonix. How can I make it work in Whonix?"

Please don't substitute writing {{Code2|Tor}} when you mean {{Code2|Tor Browser}} or the confusion will be perfect. It's Tor, not TOR.

Try safe-mail.net, HMAmail, outlook mail or http://sigaintevyh2rzvw.onion. This is not an endorsement! Don't trust them with anything. Just use them for creating the forum account.

As last resort, contact Patrick or IronSoldier on [[#IRC|IRC]], tell them your desired user name and password. They can create an account for you that does not require e-mail verification.

== Professional Support == <!--T:1--></translate>
Consulting / support for anonymity, privacy, security, data security, Whonix & system administration services.

Priority support. Answers usually within one or two business days. You can get a sample of the quality of my work by checking out [https://forums.whonix.org/users/patrick/activity my public Whonix forum activity]. You would get answers first, in private on request. You would get access to alternative means of communication including e-mail, chat and remote desktop based help (vnc/ssh).

Available on best effort basis only. No problem solutions can be promised. Usually, most time efficient and with best chances of success, is sorting out issues of topics that are already covered by Whonix [[Documentation]]. Other topics may be covered as well, feel free to ask. Goodwill in lenient way to count hours and partial charge backs if issues could not be solved.

Lower prices negotiable if the project is of general benefit to the project (for example, features that get available in the next public release) or of personal interest to me. Discounts are provided for existing and long term clients.

The price is 200 EUR / hour.

Alternatively, send your proposal, asking price (reasonable budget expectations) to lead Whonix Developer [mailto:adrelanos@riseup.net Patrick Schleizer] for negotiation.

Thanks for developing, releasing and supporting VPN-Firewall, it's a nice and useful piece of scripting.
