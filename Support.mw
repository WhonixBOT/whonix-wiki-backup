{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text       = '''Warning''': Be careful what you say, especially in public places that are archived!
}}


What is said may reveal personal information such as: 

* Location / IP Address.
* Personality.
* Skills, Aims, Goals.
* Personal Details.
* [...]


To keep the IP address hidden, visit these websites anonymously over Tor, using either the Whonix-Workstation or [https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en Tor Browser] from The Tor Project. To delink questions from an existing email or OpenID, the user should create a separate e-mail address, OpenID, and user name/s just for this purpose.

Be careful with the advice received from public places. Always get a second opinion, and do not run commands or perform steps which you do not understand. Never post any custom code or output that pertains to your system or onion service (hidden service) specifically.

== Free Support Principle ==
=== Brief Recommendations ===

It is recommended to follow these steps in order:

# Check the [[Documentation]] to see if the question has already been discussed. Use the Whonix internal search engine, and external search engines (DuckDuckGo, Startpage).
# Search the old Whonix [https://www.whonix.org/old-forum forum], new Whonix [https://forums.whonix.org/ forum] and [https://phabricator.whonix.org issue tracker] for the problem. 
# If possible, search for a solution without the Whonix-specific part of the question, as it may have been answered in mainstream Linux fora.
# Check if the problem can be replicated in vanilla operating system environments like [https://www.debian.org/ Debian] stretch, KDE, inside the virtualizer, or over [https://www.torproject.org Tor].
#If the user completes steps 1-4 and is unable to find a similar reference to their problem, then they are eligible to ask for specific support. Suitable options may include Debian user forums, unix stackexchange, VirtualBox forums, KVM mailinglist, Qubes issue tracker, Tor mailing lists, software-specific community / developer forums (for example, LibreOffice), and so forth.
# If no solution is found, the user should create a new post in the Whonix forums.
# If a solution is provided, please consider contributing by editing the Whonix [[Documentation]] and/or providing a complete answer in the [https://forums.whonix.org forums].

=== Free Support Principle Rationale ===

In an ideal world, all free support requests would be answered with minimal to no effort, or systems would run flawlessly, thus negating the need for asking questions. Unfortunately,  real world systems are flawed, and developer time and knowledge is limited.

Whonix will always be free in price as well as in freedom ([[Why_Whonix_is_Free_Software|Why?]]). In order to create a good open source software solution, Whonix has adopted the approach of {{Code2|treating users as co-developers}}. <ref>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar#Lessons_for_creating_good_open_source_software
</ref> This concept is further elaborated below.

'''The User Co-developer Concept'''

The majority of common questions have been answered in the provided [[Documentation]]. If a solution to an issue is already documented, users will usually receive just a link to the documentation in response to their question.

Whonix is a Linux distribution, with Whonix developers playing the role of integrators. Whonix itself is based on several components and software distributions developed by other projects; it is standing on the shoulders of giants. 

In simple terms, Whonix is based on: <ref>This is explained in more detail on the [[About]] page.</ref>
* A [[Supported_Platforms|supported platform]] ([https://www.debian.org/ Debian]).
* Two software packages produced by [https://www.torproejct.org The Tor Project (TPO)] - [https://www.torproject.org Tor] and [[Tor Browser]].
* A host of other software packages.


It is impossible for the [[Authorship|Whonix team]] to be aware of the solution to each and every problem that is encountered. Users are therefore encouraged to first consider if their problem is general, and unspecific to Whonix. 

Putting this principle into action means rephrasing the question and seeking solutions in other arenas. Experience has shown that for some questions, this is the only realistic method to get an answer.

'''Whonix Reliance on Debian'''

{{Based on Debian}}


An example of an inappropriate question seeking Whonix support would be "How do I save a document in Libre Office as a PDF?". The solution is easily found by use of Internet search engines. Even if a solution was difficult to find, LibreOffice would behave identically on Debian and other operating systems. Logically, the recipient for the question should be the LibreOffice community. 

On the other hand, in the unlikely event this hypothetical problem only occurred in Whonix, then it would constitute an appropriate support referral, for example: "I know how to save a document in LibreOffice as a PDF. It doesn't work in Whonix. How can I make it work in Whonix?"

== Creating an Anonymous Email Account for Support ==<!--T:23--></translate>
<translate>
<!--T:24-->
Try [https://www.anonymousspeech.com/ anonymous speech] [https://www.secure-email.org Secure Email] , or [https://protonirockerxow.onion ProtonMail + Tor]. This is not an endorsement! Don't trust them with anything. Just use them for creating the forum account.

As last resort, contact Patrick or IronSoldier on [[#IRC|IRC]], tell them your desired user name and password. They can create an account for you that does not require e-mail verification.

<translate>
== Professional Support == <!--T:1--></translate>
Consulting / support for anonymity, privacy, security, data security, Whonix & system administration services.

Priority support. Answers usually within one or two business days. You can get a sample of the quality of my work by checking out [https://forums.whonix.org/users/patrick/activity my public Whonix forum activity]. You would get answers first, in private on request. You would get access to alternative means of communication including e-mail, chat and remote desktop based help (vnc/ssh).

Available on best effort basis only. No problem solutions can be promised. Usually, most time efficient and with best chances of success, is sorting out issues of topics that are already covered by Whonix [[Documentation]]. Other topics may be covered as well, feel free to ask. Goodwill in lenient way to count hours and partial charge backs if issues could not be solved.

Lower prices negotiable if the project is of general benefit to the project (for example, features that get available in the next public release) or of personal interest to me. Discounts are provided for existing and long term clients.

The price is 200 EUR / hour.

Alternatively, send your proposal, asking price (reasonable budget expectations) to lead Whonix Developer [mailto:adrelanos@riseup.net Patrick Schleizer] for negotiation.

* '''e-mail''': ''[mailto:adrelanos@riseup.net adrelanos@riseup.net]''

Other skills than user support that I can offer.

* distribution maintenance, that includes...
* project coordination
* documentation writing
* user support
* [[What we do|What we do. Things we do at the Whonix project. Innovate, Cooperate and Educate.]]
* basic website administration (using common webapps)
* scandal prevention <ref>Obviously not a guarantee, but there has been no bad press / posts
pointing out any scandals / lies / unappropriated behavior with Whonix.</ref>
* marketing
* build automation script engineering
* iptables firewalls
* shell scripting
* Debian packaging
* Debian apt repository management
* Linux sysadmin stuff (to oversimplify it, Whonix is a collection of shell scripts, package selections and configuration files)
* licensing compliance
* Debian machine readable licensing
* release maintenance (freeze, build, sign, upload, support, hot fixes)
* reviewing user code and documentation contributions
* keeping contributors coordinated
* bug reports at upstream projects
* review of python / ruby stuff
* git
* spam reduction (moderate mailing list, moderate forum, moderate wiki)
* mirror networks
* mediation <ref>Example: contribution to move forward the stale /etc/bash.bashrc.d implementation dispute - https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=675008#72</ref>

=== Testimonials ===
Thanks for developing, releasing and supporting VPN-Firewall, it is a nice and useful piece of scripting.
