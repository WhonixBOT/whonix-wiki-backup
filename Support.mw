In the first instance, users should search the following free resources for their issue(s).

=== Computer Security ===
* General questions about computer security can be discussed at [https://security.stackexchange.com Information Security Stack Exchange].

=== General ===

* [[Documentation]].
* When [[Tor_Browser#Tor_Browser_Downloader_by_Whonix|Tor Browser Downloader]] is failing, refer to the [https://forums.whonix.org Whonix User Forums]. Since many users are affected when it breaks, there is probably already an existing topic and documented solution.
* Linux/Debian related questions are welcome <ref>http://meta.unix.stackexchange.com/questions/1461/would-you-be-happy-to-welcome-whonix-gnu-linux-users-on-unix-se</ref> on [https://unix.stackexchange.com Unix and Linux Stack Exchange].
** Add the {{Code2|whonix}} tag <ref>https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/whonix</ref>, which will alert Whonix developers and followers.

=== Tor ===

== Safety Advice == 

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text       = '''Warning''': Be careful what you say, especially in public places that are archived!
}}


What is said may reveal personal information such as: 

* Location / IP Address.
* Personality.
* Skills, Aims, Goals.
* Personal Details.
* ...

To keep the IP address hidden, visit these websites anonymously over Tor, using either the {{workstation_product_name}} or [https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en Tor Browser] from The Tor Project. To delink questions from an existing email or OpenID, it is advisable to create a separate email address, OpenID, and user name/s just for this purpose.

Be careful with the advice received from public places. Always get a second opinion and do not run commands or perform steps which you do not understand. Never post any custom code or output that pertains to your system or onion service specifically.

== General Advice == 

{{mbox
| type      = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text       = '''Tip:''' Do not accidentally substitute {{Code2|Tor}} for a question related to {{Code2|Tor Browser}}, as this causes confusion. Further, the correct terminology is Tor, not TOR.

== Free Support Principle ==
=== Brief Recommendations ===

It is recommended to follow these steps in order:

# Check the [[Documentation]] to see if the question has already been discussed. Use the Whonix internal search engine and external search engines (DuckDuckGo, Startpage).
# Search the Whonix [https://forums.whonix.org/ forums] and [https://phabricator.whonix.org issue tracker] for the problem. 
# If possible, search for a solution without the Whonix-specific part of the question, as it may have been answered in mainstream Linux fora.
# Check if the problem can be replicated in vanilla operating system environments like [https://www.debian.org/ Debian] stretch, XFCE, inside the virtualizer, or over [https://www.torproject.org Tor].
# After completing steps 1-4, a specific support request should be made if the user cannot locate a similar reference for their problem. Suitable options may include Debian user forums, unix stackexchange, VirtualBox forums, KVM mailing lists, Qubes' issue tracker, Tor mailing lists, software-specific community / developer forums (for example, LibreOffice), and so on.
# If no solution is found, the user should create a new post in the Whonix forums.
# If a solution is provided, please consider editing the Whonix [[Documentation]] as a small contribution and/or providing a complete answer in the [https://forums.whonix.org forums].

=== Free Support Principle Rationale ===

In an ideal world, all free support requests would be answered with minimal to no effort or systems would run flawlessly, thus negating the need for asking questions. Unfortunately, real world systems are flawed and developer time and knowledge is limited.

Whonix will always be free in price as well as in freedom ([[Why_Whonix_is_Freedom_Software|Why?]]). In order to create a solid open source software solution, Whonix has adopted the approach of {{Code2|treating users as co-developers}}. <ref>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar#Lessons_for_creating_good_open_source_software
</ref> This concept is further elaborated below.

==== The User Co-developer Concept ====

The majority of common questions have been answered in the available [[Documentation]]. If the solution to an issue is already documented, users will usually receive just a link to the documentation in response to their question.

Whonix is a Linux distribution, with Whonix developers and users playing the role of integrators. Whonix itself is based on several components and software distributions developed by other projects; it is standing on the shoulders of giants. 

In simple terms, Whonix is based on: <ref>This is explained in more detail on the [[About]] page.</ref>

* A [[Supported_Platforms|supported platform]] ([https://www.debian.org/ Debian]).
* Two software packages produced by [https://www.torproejct.org The Tor Project (TPO)] - [https://www.torproject.org Tor] and [[Tor Browser]].
* A host of other software packages.

It is impossible for the [[Team|Whonix team]] to be aware of the solution to each and every problem that is encountered. Users are therefore encouraged to first consider if their problem is general, and unspecific to Whonix. 

Putting this principle into action means rephrasing the question, seeking solutions in other arenas, and preferably documenting this solution in the [[Documentation]]. Experience has shown that for some questions, this is the only realistic way to solve them.

Users might [[FAQ#Linux_Distributions|expect Whonix to provide a unified experience]] similar to a Windows machine. While the Whonix developers make every effort to meet user expectations, limited funding and human resources makes meeting these expectations all but impossible. <ref>A problem all Linux distributions face.</ref>

==== Whonix Reliance on Debian ====

{{Based on Debian}}


An example of an inappropriate question seeking Whonix support would be "How do I save a document in Libre Office as a PDF?". The solution is easily found by use of Internet search engines. Even if a solution was difficult to find, LibreOffice would behave identically on Debian and other operating systems. Logically, the recipient for the question should be the LibreOffice community. 

On the other hand, in the unlikely event this hypothetical problem only occurred in {{project_name}}, then it would constitute an appropriate support referral, for example: "I know how to save a document in LibreOffice as a PDF. It doesn't work in Whonix. How can I make it work in Whonix?"

== Creating an Anonymous Email Account for Support ==
Users can try [https://danwin1210.me/mail/ Danwin1210.me],  [https://www.anonymousspeech.com/ Anonymous Speech] or [https://protonmail.com ProtonMail]. This is not an endorsement! Users should not trust the providers with any of their personal information, but only use them for creating the forum account.

As a last resort, Lilias_Sorcha or BlackMug can be contacted on [[#IRC|IRC]] with the desired user name and password. An account can then be created which does not require e-mail verification.
