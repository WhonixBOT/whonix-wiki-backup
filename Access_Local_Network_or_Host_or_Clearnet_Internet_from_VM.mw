= Introduction =
[[File Transfer]] might be a much easier alternative.

= Prerequisite Knowledge =
* [[Stream_Isolation/Easy|stream isolation basic knowledge]]
* [[Stream_Isolation/Disable_Easy|disable stream isolation]]

= Instructions =
The following example uses ssh. It could be replaced with anything else.

Can only be used from inside {{gateway product name}}.

[[Undocumented]] for {{workstation product name}}.

== On the Host ==
Install the server software. Note: <code>ssh</code> is an example. Can be replaced.

{{Install Package
|package=ssh
}}

== Inside the VM ==
Install the client software. Note: <code>openssh-client</code> is an example. Can be replaced.

{{Install Package
|package=openssh-client
}}

Create a persistent home folder for user <code>clearnet</code>. (Optional.)

{{Box|text=
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo usermod -d /home/clearnet clearnet
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo mkhomedir_helper clearnet
}}
}}

Open a shell under user <code>clearnet</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo -u clearnet bash
}}

Permanently disable stream isolation or temporarily circumvent stream isolation.

Syntax:

{{CodeSelect|code=
client-software ip-address
}}

Example:

Note:

* Replace <code>ssh</code> with the desired client software.
* Replace the IP <code>192.168.1.0</code> with the actual local LAN IP of the host.
* Drop <code>.anondist-orig</code> if the command is not uwt wrapped by default.

{{CodeSelect|code=
ssh.anondist-orig 192.168.1.0
}}

= Troubleshooting =
* The host firewall if any might block connections to the service.
