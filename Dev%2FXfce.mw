desktop background files in the git repository:

* Kicksecure: https://github.com/Whonix/whonix-xfce-desktop-config/blob/master/etc/skel/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/xfce4-desktop.xml (that package will be renamed at some point)
* Whonix-Workstation: https://github.com/Whonix/anon-ws-base-files/blob/master/etc/skel/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/xfce4-desktop.xml.anondist
* Whonix-Gateway: https://github.com/Whonix/anon-gw-base-files/blob/master/etc/skel/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/xfce4-desktop.xml.anondist

These files will be copied to user's home folder at first boot - and at first boot only. Because that is the only time when files are copied from /etc/skel/ to user home.

From:

<pre>
etc/skel/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/xfce4-desktop.xml
</pre>

To:

<pre>
/home/user/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/xfce4-desktop.xml
</pre>

File in home folder will be modified by Xfce.

Any other updates to files in /etc/skel/ by package, developer or user will be disregarded by Xfce even after reboot. That is because Xfce uses the files in the home folder only which won't notice any change in /etc/skel/.


Prerequisite knowledge: [[Dev/About_Debian_Packaging#Files_in_.2Fetc.2Fskel|Files in /etc/skel]]

Therefore, testing modified files in `/etc/skel` is cumbersome. Instructions

'''1.''' Use a [[Desktop#Virtual_Consoles|virtual console]]!

Not a virtual terminal emulator such as xfce4-terminal. A virtual console is required because the following command is ineffective is run from inside a running Xfce.

'''2.''' Have a look at <code>desktop-background-skel-test</code>.

[https://github.com/Whonix/helper-scripts/blob/master/usr/libexec/helper-scripts/desktop-background-skel-test /usr/libexec/helper-scripts/desktop-background-skel-test]

'''3.''' Run <code>desktop-background-skel-test</code>.
