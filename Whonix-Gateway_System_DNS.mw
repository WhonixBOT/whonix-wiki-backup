== Introduction ==
'''Advanced users only!''' <br />
'''Usually recommended against and unnecessary.'''

{{TorifiedGateway}}

Whonix-Workstation is configured to use various SocksPorts, DnsPort and TransPort, see also [[Stream Isolation]]. Whonix-Gateway is only configured to use various SocksPorts. A global system DNS resolver isn't required for Whonix-Gateway for any common use case to justify enabling it by default. Use cases where this could be useful include:

* resolving the hostname of a proxy used in {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}} through Tor would be useful ([http://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/41116dda/ technical explanation])
* resolving the hostname of a VPN. But then using a VPN configuration using IPs only would be better.
* Perhaps we could use {{Code2|/etc/hosts}} for such use cases rather than enabling system DNS?

== How ==
Working. Using Whonix-Gateway's user {{Code2|clearnet}}.
