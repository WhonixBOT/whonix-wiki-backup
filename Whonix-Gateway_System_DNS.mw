Whonix-Workstation is configured to use various SocksPorts, DnsPort and TransPort, see also [[Stream Isolation]]. Whonix-Gateway is only configured to use various SocksPorts. A global system DNS resolver isn't required for Whonix-Gateway for anything. (Except, resolving the hostname of a proxy used in /etc/tor/torrc through Tor would be useful.)
