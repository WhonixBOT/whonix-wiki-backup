= DNS on {{gateway_product_name}} =
== Introduction ==
{{Box|text=
{{TorifiedGateway}}
}}

{{Box|text=
{{workstation_product_name}} is configured to use various SocksPorts, DnsPort and TransPort, see also [[Stream Isolation]].
}}

{{Box|text=
{{gateway_product_name}} is only configured to use various SocksPorts. A global system DNS resolver is not required for {{gateway_product_name}} for any common use case to justify enabling it by default. Use cases where this could be useful include:

* resolving the hostname of a proxy used in {{Code2|/usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf}} through Tor would be useful ([http://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/41116dda/ technical explanation])
* resolving the hostname of a VPN. But then using a VPN configuration using IPs only would be better.
* Perhaps we could use {{Code2|/etc/hosts}} for such use cases rather than enabling system DNS?

== How ==
{{Box|text=
'''Advanced users only!''' <br />
'''Usually recommended against and unnecessary.'''

Working. Using {{gateway_product_name}} user {{Code2|clearnet}}.

}}

Disable <code>/etc/dhcp/dhclient-enter-hooks.d/nodnsupdate</code> by making it no longer executable so DHCP will write to <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo chmod -x /etc/dhcp/dhclient-enter-hooks.d/nodnsupdate
}}

Make <code>/etc/resov.conf</code> mutable. Don't worry if the next command causes an error. It's not required anymore in recent Whonix versions.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo chattr -i /etc/resolv.conf
}}

Delete <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> so we can regenerate it.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf
}}

Restart networking.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo service networking restart
}}

Login as user clearnet.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo su clearnet
}}

Test it, for example using ping.

{{CodeSelect|code=
ping google.com
}}
}}
