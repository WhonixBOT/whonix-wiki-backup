== Introduction ==
{{Box|text=
System DNS here is defined as:

* resolving DNS,
** without use of a socksifier such as <code>torsocks</code>,
** without application proxy settings,
** without a Tor <code>SocksPort</code>.
* using the usual mechanisms on Linux for resolving DNS.
* that are usually configured through configuration file <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>.
* that would happen when running <code>nslookup</code>.

{{Box|text=
{{workstation_product_name}} is configured to use various [https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en#SocksPort <code>SocksPort</code>s], [https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en#DNSPort <code>DNSPort</code>] and [https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en#TransPort <code>TransPort</code>], see also [[Stream Isolation]]. Using system DNS on {{workstation_product_name}} by default does not require {{gateway_product_name}} system DNS. <ref>
That is because DNS traffic originating from {{workstation_product_name}} gets redirected to Tor's <code>DNSPort</code> running on {{gateway_product_name}} by [[Whonix-Gateway Firewall]].
</ref> Modifications of <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> on {{gateway_product_name}} have no effect on {{workstation_product_name}}.
}}

{{Box|text=
{{gateway_product_name}} is only configured to use various <code>SocksPort</code>s. A global system DNS resolver to resolve DNS originating from applications running on {{gateway_product_name}} is not required for any common use case to justify enabling it by default. Use cases where this could be useful include:

* resolving the hostname of a proxy used in <code>/usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf</code> through Tor would be useful ([http://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/41116dda/ technical explanation])
* resolving the hostname of a VPN. But then using a VPN configuration using IPs only would be better.
* Perhaps we could use <code>/etc/hosts</code> for such use cases rather than enabling system DNS?

Working. Using {{gateway_product_name}} user <code>clearnet</code>.

Disable <code>/etc/dhcp/dhclient-enter-hooks.d/nodnsupdate</code> by making it no longer executable so DHCP will write to <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>. The following command only applies to older versions of Whonix or those who have package <code>anon-gw-dhcp-conf</code> installed.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo chmod -x /etc/dhcp/dhclient-enter-hooks.d/nodnsupdate
}}

Make <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> mutable. Don't worry if the next command causes an error. It's not required anymore in recent {{project_name}} versions.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo chattr -i /etc/resolv.conf
}}

Delete <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> so we can regenerate it.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf
}}

Restart networking.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo service networking restart
}}

Login as user clearnet.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo su clearnet
}}

Test it, for example using ping.

{{CodeSelect|code=
ping google.com
}}
}}
