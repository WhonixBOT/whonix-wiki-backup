If time-constrained, users should at least read the {{project name}} Important News Forum Tag. Follow the {{project name}} News Forums if detailed anonymity / privacy / security-related issues are of interest, or to follow recent {{project name}} developments.

= Reason =
In the future <u>it could be in theory happen</u> that users need to be notified "critical security vulnerability in APT being actively exploited by Tor exit relays against random users. Stop using APT until there is a solution." Therefore a solid mechanism to notify as many users as possible is required.

= Debian Security Announcements =
Since {{project name}} is [[About#Based_on_Debian|based on Debian]], users should consider subscribing to the Debian [https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/ security announcement mailing list] to stay informed about the latest security advisories. See also chapter [[Operating_System_Hardening#Debian_Security_Announcements|Debian Security Announcements]].

= Operating System Updates =
As strongly recommended in the Security Guide, it is necessary to regularly check for [[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates#Updates|operating system updates]] on the host operating system, and both the {{workstation_product_name}} and {{gateway_product_name}}.

= Social Media Profiles =
There are some [[Official {{project_name_short}} Online Profiles|Official {{project_name}} Social Media Profiles]] online, but please do not rely on them for the latest {{project_name}} News or to contact {{project_name}} developers (see [[support]] and [[contact]]).

As some users will disregard this advice, messages from the {{project_name}} Feature Blog are most times posted on [[File:1024px-Telegram_2019_Logo.svg.png|25px|link=https://t.me/s/{{project_name_short}}_All_News]] {{link|link=https://t.me/s/{{project_name_short}}_All_News|text={{project_name}} Telegram News Channel}}, [[File:twitter.png|25px|link=https://twitter.com/{{project_name_short}}]] {{link|link=https://twitter.com/{{project_name_short}}|text={{project_name}} Twitter Profile}} and the [[File:facebook.png|25px|link=https://www.facebook.com/{{project_name_short}}]] {{link|link=https://www.facebook.com/{{project_name_short}}|text={{project_name}} Facebook Profile}}. However, they are most times not mirrored to other {{project_name}} social media profiles.

If it is safe to inform others about {{project name}}, feel free to [[Contribute|Contribute]] via an anonymous account that follows or likes these profiles. This page can be shared on: {{Share}}

= Source Code =
If {{project_name}} source code updates are of interest, [[Dev/git#subscribe_to_code_changes|subscribe to code changes]].

= Tor Browser =
Tor Browser's built-in update check mechanism also works in {{project name}}, so use it whenever updates become available. <ref>
The only exception is Tor Browser running in a DisposableVM in [[Qubes|{{q_project_name}}]], since the update will not persist.

For additional information about Tor Browser updates see [[Tor_Browser#Update_Tor_Browser|Tor Browser]]. Additionally, consider subscribing to https://blog.torproject.org for developments from The Tor Project.
