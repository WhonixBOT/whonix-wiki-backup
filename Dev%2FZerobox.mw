== Introduction ==

ARM board running Tor + YaCy + ZeroNet


== Toolchain ==

Armbian is a cross-compiling toolchain project that runs on x86 hardware and generates Debian images for ARM boards:

== Scope ==

Can potentially serve as a Tor Bridge and also a seed node for other kinds of P2P services in the future.

* Bridges don't need the uptime/maintenance/bandwidth of a proper Tor relay.

* Transports like Snowflake eliminate the need for TCP forwarding configurations.


== Usability ==

* A SSH/VNC server listens only on a link local address
that is accessible from their PC directly through an Ethernet connection
only:

*Does not need an existing network connection to administrate the box.
*Does not expose the box to SSH attacks on conventional networks.

* Authenticated HSs can be optionally setup for advanced users who want a secure way to connect to the box remotely.

* https://sandstorm.io/ - a project for making server usability as easy as Android.
