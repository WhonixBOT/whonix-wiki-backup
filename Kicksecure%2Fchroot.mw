== Qubes Notes ==
Only users of Qubes need to consider these notes in this chapter.

Users that don't use Qubes or don't know what Qubes is should skip this chapter.

TODO: elaborate

* nosuid / nodev can cause issues?
* default private image size (/home folder) is too small for {{Kicksecure}} XFCE

== Install Required Tools ==
<ref>
* <code>apt-transport-https</code> is required for some older Debian based Linux distributions that have not integrated https support into APT yet. If not available in your distribution, can be safely ignored.
* <code>apt-transport-tor</code> is required because [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-apt-sources-list/blob/master/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list] is using <code>tor+https</code>. Otherwise we would see the following error.

* <code>tor</code> is required so <code>apt-transport-tor</code> can use Tor. Otherwise we would see the following error.

* Actually package <code>apt-transport-tor</code> recommends package <code>tor</code> but listing it here anyhow for those using APT with parameter <code>--no-install-recommends</code>.
* <code>apt-transport-https</code> is suggested below to download the signing key.

|package=mmdebstrap apt-transport-https apt-transport-tor tor curl
}}

== Add Signing Key ==
{{Box|text=
It is required to add the signing key on the host because <code>mmdebstrap</code> will need it.

(Users of {{Project name}} and {{kicksecure}} could skip this step since the signing key is there by default.)

Key could be removed at the end. (Except {{Project name}} and {{kicksecure}} should not do this unless they upgrade from source code.)

}}

== Set Variables ==
File <code>/etc/hostname</code> must exist. <ref>
Fixed in <code>mmdebstrap</code> <code>0.5.0</code>. Quote [https://gitlab.mister-muffin.de/josch/mmdebstrap/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md changelog]:
<blockquote>
do not copy /etc/resolv.conf or /etc/hostname if the host system doesn't have them
</blockquote>
Therefore no longer required in Debian <code>bullseye</code>.
</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo touch /etc/hostname
}}

== Set Variables ==
Note: You could also replace <code>kicksecure-xfce</code> with <code>kicksecure-cli</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
package=kicksecure-xfce
repo=buster-developers
path_to_chroot=~/kicksecure-xfce-chroot
path_to_temp_sources_list=~/temp-sources.list
}}

== APT Sources List ==
Create temporary APT sources list for <code>mmdebstrap</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
echo "
deb https://deb.debian.org/debian-security/ buster/updates main contrib non-free
deb https://deb.debian.org/debian buster main contrib non-free
deb https://deb.whonix.org $repo main contrib non-free
" > "$path_to_temp_sources_list"
}}

== APT Cache ==
Optional. If you are interested, please press Expand on the right side.

<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
This shouldn't be done unless you are behind a firewall since apt-cacher-ng will by default listen on all network interfaces.

== Run mmdebstrap ==
Run <code>mmdebstrap</code>. <ref>
<code>debootstrap</code> cannot be used since it is a single-mirror Debian chroot creation tool. I.e. it cannot use multiple APT repositories at the same time. And {{Kicksecure}} APT repository does not ships no packages available from packages.debian.org. Therefore using <code>mmdebstrap</code> which is a multi-mirror Debian chroot creation. If you cannot use <code>mmdebstrap</code> either (cross platform builds?), you could first create a Debian chroot using <code>debootstrap</code> (or anything) and then install a {{Kicksecure}} meta package manually inside the chroot.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo \
SECURITY_MISC_INSTALL=force \

--variant=required \
--include $package \
$apt_cacher_ng_maybe \
buster \
"$path_to_chroot" \
"$path_to_temp_sources_list"
}}

== Chroot Post Processing ==
Delete the chroot's temporary <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code>. <ref>
During chroot build process the following files were already created.

* <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list</code>
* <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/whonix.list</code>
</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo rm "$path_to_chroot/etc/apt/sources.list"
}}

== Host Cleanup ==
Optional: You can delete the signing key from the host.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo rm /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/derivative.gpg
}}

= Usage =
=== Simple Classic Chroot Method ===
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo chroot ~/kicksecure-xfce-chroot bash
}}

== systemd-nspawn Method ==
=== Install systemd-nspawn ===

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt install systemd-container
}}

=== systemd-nspawn Simple Chroot ===
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemd-nspawn -D ~/kicksecure-xfce-chroot
}}

=== systemd-nspawn Boot Chroot CLI Only ===
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemd-nspawn -D ~/kicksecure-xfce-chroot /sbin/init
}}

=== systemd-nspawn Boot Chroot with GUI Support ===
This is unfinished. Unspecific to {{Kicksecure}}. Could be resolved as per [[Free Support Principle]].

{{CodeSelect|code=
xhost +local:
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemd-nspawn --setenv=DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -D ~/kicksecure-xfce-chroot /sbin/init
}}

=== Exit systemd-nspawn Chroot ===
{{systemd-nspawn-exit}}

=== Limitations of systemd-nspawn based Chroot ===
Despite these limitations, <code>systemd-nspawn</code> should probably preferred over classic <code>chroot</code>. Depends on what you are trying to accomplish.

* [[sdwdate]] (and [[Boot Clock Randomization]]) cannot work inside <code>systemd-nspawn</code>.
* Tor will fail to start inside <code>systemd-nspawn</code> <code>chroot</code> if Tor is already running on the host in default config (local listen post <code>9050</code>). But that shouldn't matter. The <code>systemd-nspawn</code> <code>chroot</code> will use the host's Tor in this case. <code>systemd-nspawn</code> has also option to run private networking but these have not been researched for {{Kicksecure}} yet.
