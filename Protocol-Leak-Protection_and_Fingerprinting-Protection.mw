== Introduction ==
Whonix can not do the impossible and magically prevent all kinds of [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO#Protocolleaks protocol leaks]. However, it does offer best possible protection. It is a multi level protection always trying to prevent the worst.

== Most dangerous leaks are protected ==
Most dangerous leaks are protected. The following ones are in the most dangerous categorical, because they would lead remotely and directly to the users real identity.

* Your real external non-Tor IP address is covered due to the whole {{project name}} design, isolated proxy usage and [[Install_Software#Whonix-Workstation_is_firewalled|the {{project name}} firewall]]. <ref name=one>
This does not cover application vulnerabilities and exploits, which escalate from the virtual machine to the host see [[Comparison_with_Others#Attacks|Attacks]]. However, by design, the {{workstation_product_name}} does not know its own external non-Tor IP address.
</ref>
* The same as above goes for DNS<ref name=one /> requests, they are safe. <ref>
''/etc/resolv.conf'' in {{workstation_product_name}} is configured to use the Whonix-Gateway as DNS resolver, which is routed through Tor.
</ref>

== Many {{project name}} default applications are already configured, not to leak ==
* Configured to use their own SocksPort ([[Stream Isolation]]), thus preventing Identity correlation through circuit sharing.
* Browser fingerprinting: ''Whonix Example Implementation'' [[Tor Browser|includes Tor Browser]]. The browser fingerprint is as good/as bad, as if you were using the normal Tor Browser from torproject.org.
* GPG: /home/user/gpg.conf is optimized for privacy [https://github.com/ioerror/torbirdy/pull/11 recommended] as per [https://github.com/ioerror/torbirdy/blob/master/gpg.conf torbirdy github repository] not to leak your operating system version (no-emit-version) and other stuff ([https://github.com/Whonix/anon-gpg-tweaks/blob/master/usr/share/anon-gpg-tweaks/.gnupg/gpg.conf on github]).
* HexChat: uses secure defaults as per [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/HexChat TorifyHOWTO/HexChat] ([https://github.com/Whonix/xchat-improved-privacy on github]). Identity can be reset using ''xchat-reset'' ([https://github.com/Whonix/xchat-improved-privacy/blob/master/usr/bin/xchat-reset on github]) as documented on the [[HexChat]] page.
* ssh: Without {{project_name}}, syntax for ssh is user@hostname [...], but if the user forgets to specific user before @hostname, the operating system user name will be used and if that is something identifiable, anonymity is broken. Since {{project name}} set the user name to ''user'', in worst case, only the username ''user'' can be leaked, which is harmless. He could just have copied the syntax from the manpage. In another, similar project, Tails, the username is set to amnesia, which is also not something the user entered and therefore safe.

Many protocol leaks are documented, see [[Documentation]] and [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO TorifyHOWTO].

== Important identifiers ==

These are also important identifiers, because they can be used for fingerprinting, narrow down the list of suspects (for example, the time zone) or even lead to directly to deanonymization (for example, if username were set to John Doe).

* <s>Desktop resolution is 1024x768 for all {{project name}} users. (Virtual) refresh rate is set to 60.</s> <ref>
You can check the desktop resolution and refresh rate by running in console: 

<pre>
xrandr
</pre>
</ref>
* Color depth is the default 24 bit for all {{project name}} users. <ref>
You can check color depth by running in console: 

<pre>
xdpyinfo | grep "of root"
</pre>
</ref> <ref name=fontlist>
Note that you can not rely on https://ip-check.info or similar websites for checking desktop resolution and color depth, because Tor Button changes this values to improve your anonymity. See Tor Button specification and Tor trac for details. You can check installed fonts using: 

<pre>
fc-list
</pre>
</ref>
* All {{project name}} users have the same list of fonts installed. <ref>
As long you or any additional software packages do not install further packages.
</ref> <ref>
Only 3 common fonts (monospace, serif, times new roman) for all Tor Browser users can be detected. </ref> <ref>
Robert Ransom suggested, if possible, to share the same list of fonts as Tails. Since Tor Browser does not leak, which fonts are installed anymore {{project name}} developer adrelanos fails to see the advantage of this. Follow-up inquiry ignored.
</ref>
* Internal (virtual LAN) IP address:
** [[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]]: Same range for all [[{{q_project_name_short}}|{{q_project_name}}]] users. ([https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/1143 related ticket])
** [[VirtualBox]] / [[KVM]]: Is the same for all {{project name}} users.<ref>
You can check your internal (virtual LAN) IP address using: 

<pre>
sudo ifconfig
</pre>
</ref>
* Time
** Whonix-Workstation, Whonix-Gateway and the host time are all different from each other.
** Time zone (local time) is set to UTC. <ref>
You can check your time zone using: 

<pre>
cat /etc/timezone
</pre>
</ref>
** Hardware clock is set to UTC.
** See [[TimeSync|{{project name}} Time Synchronization Mechanism]] for more information.
* User name is set to user.
* Hostname is set to host. <ref>You can check that by running.

<pre>
host
</pre>
</ref>
* Long host name (FQDN) is set to host.localdomain. <ref>You can check that by running.
<pre>
hostname --fqdn
</pre>
</ref>
* Operating system (apt-get) updates are routed through their own circuit ([[Stream Isolation]]) to prevent accidentally leakage of your software packages and versions (if any custom software installed) which then could be correlated with other anonymous activity. See also [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO#Softwareupdaters Software updaters] and [[Install Software | Software installation Whonix-Workstation]].
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address MAC address] is different from the host <ref>
You can check Whonix-Workstations MAC address using 

<pre>
sudo ifconfig | grep HWaddr
</pre>

inside {{workstation_product_name}} and then comparing with your host.
</ref> <ref>
Disadvantages of shared MAC Addresses:

* [[Multiple_Whonix-Workstations]] can not use the internet at the same time if they are using the same MAC address. It leads to confusing connection interruptions in the one or the other virtual machine.
* The advantage of sharing MAC addresses among all {{project name}} versions are very little. (That would be useful, in case an application leaks the MAC address or in case {{workstation_product_name}} got compromised.)
* The project maintainers have to explain and defend the design, which takes a lot time of such little gain. (Again, it is important not to expose the hosts, the real MAC address, but as long as the one inside the virtual machine is different, everything is in an acceptable state.)
</ref> <ref>
Advantages of shared MAC addresses:

* It may be easier to develop [[Connections_between_Whonix-Gateway_and_Whonix-Workstation#ARP_spoofing_defense|ARP spoofing defense]] to implement authenticated connections between {{gateway_product_name}} and {{workstation_product_name}}. (Only useful when using [[Multiple Whonix-Workstations]].) To understand the context, please read [[Connections_between_Whonix-Gateway_and_Whonix-Workstation]].
* There are cases, were some applications gather your MAC address and send it to a remote server (proprietary license checks use the MAC for hardware fingerprinting) and we might be better off with a shared one then?
</ref>
* Worst case scenario: contents of your RAM (error reporting software phoning home; RAM dump if infected with malware; [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransparentProxyLeaks Transparent Proxy Leaks]) would "only" contain the RAM of your Whonix-Workstation. All your non-anonymous stuff on your Host would stay safe.

== Metadata ==

See [[Metadata]].

== Less important identifiers ==

These identifiers are less important, because an adversary can only collect them, either if the user installed malicious software (for example, some copyright enforcement and anticheat tools collect them) or only if the adversary got remote access, i.e. the adversary has compromised a user or in some cases the root account.

* Hardware serial numbers which any applications could collect are hidden due to the Virtual Machine.<ref>
You can check the visible hardware yourself with 

<pre>
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install lshw
</pre>

<pre>
sudo lshw
</pre>

and 

<pre>
sudo lspci
</pre>

If you have USB devices attached use: 

<pre>
sudo apt-get install usbutils
sudo lsusb
</pre>

and then comparing with your host.
</ref>
* CPU model and capabilities.
** Qubes: {{BgRedText|Not hidden.}}
** VirtualBox: {{BgRedText|Not hidden.}} <ref>
These were hidden by VirtualBox "Synthetic CPU" in past but that feature was removed from VirtualBox. (Even then the clock speed of your host CPU was visible to all code (applications or malware) inside Whonix-Workstation.) [https://phabricator.whonix.org/T408 The parameters --cpuid-portability-level or --cpuidremoveall have been tested and do not hide it either.]
</ref>
** KVM: {{BgGreenText|Hidden.}} <ref>
https://phabricator.whonix.org/T449
</ref>
<ref>
This is due to the design of virtualization platforms (VirtualBox, VMware, etc.). Most virtualization platforms leak CPU model, capabilities and clock speed. Check.

<pre>
cat /proc/cpuinfo
</pre>

If that is a still problem for you another workaround could be to use an emulator, such as QEMU (port available, documented, see [[QEMU]]) or [http://bochs.sourceforge.net/ bochs] (no one has created a port yet, undocumented). Unfortunately such emulators are slow and there might be other limitations. (Does Bochs support internal networking?)
</ref>
* RAM.
** Qubes: {{BgYellowText|Dynamically assigned.}}
** VirtualBox / KVM:  {{BgGreenText|Is set to 768 MB.}}
* Sensor information (cpu temperature, hdd temperature, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M.A.R.T. S.M.A.R.T.]):  {{BgGreenText|Hidden.}} <ref>
You can check the sensor information using: 

<pre>
sudo apt-get install hddtemp

## Qubes
sudo hddtemp /dev/xvda

## VirtualBox
sudo hddtemp /dev/sda

## KVM
sudo hddtemp /dev/vda
</pre>

 and 

<pre>
sudo apt-get install lm-sensors
sudo sensors-detect
</pre>
</ref> Fortunately virtualizers hide them from the guest Virtual Machine by not implementing them.
* Battery information. <ref>
You can check the battery information using: 

<pre>
sudo apt-get install acpi

acpi -V
</pre>
</ref>
** Qubes: {{BgGreenText|Hidden.}}
** VirtualBox: {{BgRedText|Not hidden.}}
** KVM: {{BgGreenText|Hidden.}}

* BIOS DMI information. 
** Qubes: {{BgGreenText|Hidden.}}
** VirtualBox: {{BgGreenText|Hidden.}}
** KVM: {{BgGreenText|Hidden.}}
<ref name=biosdmi>
You can check the BIOS DMI information using: 

<pre>
sudo dmidecode
</pre>
</ref>
* Virtual BIOS DMI information and Virtual HDD and CD serial numbers.
** Qubes: {{BgGreenText|Hidden. (Only virtual ones.)}}
** VirtualBox: {{BgGreenText|Hidden. (Only virtual ones.)}}
** KVM: {{BgGreenText|Hidden. (Only virtual ones.)}}
<ref name=biosdmi /> <ref>
You can see disk ids using: 

<pre>
sudo ls -la /dev/disk/by-id/
</pre>

<pre>
sudo ls -la /dev/disk/by-uuid/
</pre>

Then compare with the host.
</ref>
* VM UUID: {{BgGreenText|Hidden.}} (As in explained in [http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch08.html#vboxmanage-modifyvdi VBoxManage modifyhd] has no relation to your host by default.) <ref>
You can check the VM UUID using:

<pre>
sudo dmidecode
</pre>
</ref>
* [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/hh673514.aspx SLIC table]:
** Qubes: {{BgGreenText|Hidden. (Not implemented.)}}
** VirtualBox: {{BgGreenText|Hidden. (Is empty by default.)}}
** KVM: {{BgGreenText|Hidden. (Is not present.)}}
<ref>
You can check the SILC table using: 

<pre>
sudo cat /sys/firmware/acpi/tables/SLIC
</pre>

inside your virtualizer and on your host. On your host there may or may be not be a SLIC table. If there is none, it can't leak into your virtualizer. If there is one, you'll see, that it is not mirrored in VirtualBox, which is fine.
</ref>
* HDD UUIDs: {{BgGreenText|Different from your host.}} <ref>
You can check the HDD UUID using: 

<pre>
## Qubes
sudo hdparm -i /dev/xvda

## VirtualBox
sudo hdparm -i /dev/sda

## KVM
sudo hdparm -i /dev/vda
</pre>
</ref>
* CD-ROM UUID: {{BgGreenText|Same for all {{project name}} users.}} <ref>
You can check the CD-ROM UUID using: 

<pre>
udisks --show-info /dev/cdrom
</pre>
</ref>
* software packages: {{BgYellowText|Differs for [[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]] and [[{{non q project name short}}|{{non q project name}}]]. And...}} All {{project name}} users have by default the same set of software packages installed. - If you install software packages yourself, you give up that advantage. See also [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO#Softwareupdaters Software updaters].
* Disk uuids: {{BgGreenText|Hidden}} (Real hardware uuids are hidden through the virtualizer.)
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_display_identification_data EDID] is hidden by virtualizer.
** Qubes: {{BgGreenText|Hidden.}} (See [[#Qubes|Qubes EDID]].)
** VirtualBox: (See [[#VirtualBox|VirtualBox EDID]].) <ref>
* [https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/10976 document all virtual hardware serial numbers implemented by VirtualBox]
* [https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/10975 document which information from the host are visible to VMs]
