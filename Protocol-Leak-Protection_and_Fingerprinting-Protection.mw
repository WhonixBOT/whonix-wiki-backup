= Introduction =
{{project_name}} cannot do the impossible and magically prevent every kind of [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO#Protocolleaks protocol leak] and identifier disclosure:

<blockquote>Tor provides only anonymity for DNS and the transmission of the TCP stream. Everything inside the stream, the application protocol, needs to be scrubbed. For example, if the application uses advanced techniques to determine your real external IP and sends it over the anonymized TCP stream, then what you wanted to hide, your real external IP, isn't hidden.
...

Many applications can also leak other problematic and/or sensitive data, such as:

* Your real external non-Tor IP address, as described above
* Your time zone (for example: IRC clients through CTCP)
* Your user name (for example: ssh through login)
* The name and version of the client or server you are using (for example: Apache web server leaks software name and version number; IRC clients leak client name and client version number through CTCP)
* ​Metadata can be a risk. Click ​MAT and read 'What is a metadata?' and 'Why metadata can be a risk for your privacy?'
* Depending on your Mode Of Anonymity you obviously shouldn't mix your use of protected (anonymous) applications with applications not passing through the Tor network or some other form of anonymity. For example, if a login name or password of yours can be traced back to your personal identity, then you are defeating the purpose entirely. Tor can not protect you from this kind of activity
* Even sending the contents of your RAM can be dangerous. (For example: error reporting, leading to Transparent Proxy Leaks)
* A lot of information which the application sends on request from a server (for example: most web browsers beside the Tor Browser)
* Hardware serial numbers might be used for fingerprinting and in the worst case scenario, lead back to you.
* License keys of non-freedom software is often transmitted and might lead back to you.</blockquote> 

Despite the many risks, {{project_name}} is designed to offer multiple layers of defense for the best possible protection against inadvertent deanonymization.

= Whonix Advantages =

== Protection Against Serious Leaks ==

{{project_name}} protects against the most dangerous leak categories outlined below, which would otherwise divulge the user's real identity (remotely or directly):

* The real, external, non-Tor IP address is hidden due to the fundamental {{project name}} design, use of an isolated proxy, and the [[Install_Software#{{workstation_product_name}}_is_firewalled|{{project name}} firewall]]. <ref name=one>
This does not cover application vulnerabilities and exploits, which escalate from the virtual machine to the host. See: [[Comparison_with_Others#Attacks|Attacks]]. However, by design the {{workstation_product_name}} does not know its own external non-Tor IP address.
</ref>
* The same applies for DNS<ref name=one /> requests; they are safe. <ref>
''/etc/resolv.conf'' in {{workstation_product_name}} is configured to use the {{gateway_product_name}} as the DNS resolver, which is routed through Tor.
</ref>

== Numerous Default Applications are Pre-configured Against Leaks ==

Developers have taken care to prevent common applications from leaking information that could identify users, including:

* <u>[[Stream Isolation]]</u>: Configuring applications to use their own SocksPort, thus preventing Identity correlation through circuit sharing.
* <u>Browser fingerprinting</u>: {{project_name}} [[Tor Browser|includes Tor Browser]] by default. The browser fingerprint is as good (or bad) as using the normal Tor Browser bundle from torproject.org
* <u>GPG</u>: <code>/home/user/gpg.conf</code> is optimized for privacy; see footnote. <ref>Adhering to [https://github.com/ioerror/torbirdy/pull/11 recommendations] as per the [https://github.com/ioerror/torbirdy/blob/master/gpg.conf torbirdy github repository], which prevents leakage of the operating system version (no-emit-version) and other variables ([https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/anon-gpg-tweaks/blob/master/usr/share/anon-gpg-tweaks/.gnupg/gpg.conf on github]).</ref>
* <u>HexChat</u>: Secure defaults are utilized as per [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/HexChat TorifyHOWTO/HexChat] ([https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/xchat-improved-privacy on github]). The identity can be reset using ''xchat-reset'' ([https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/xchat-improved-privacy/blob/master/usr/bin/xchat-reset on github]) as documented on the [[HexChat]] page.
* <u>ssh</u>: Without {{project_name}}, the syntax for ssh is user@hostname [...]. However, if a specific user is not nominated before @hostname, the operating system user name will be utilized instead. If that value is something identifiable, then anonymity is broken. Since {{project name}} defaults the user name to <code>user</code>, in the worst case only the username <code>user</code> can be leaked, which is harmless. <ref>In this case it may appear that the syntax was simply copied from the manpage.</ref> <ref>The Tails OS similarly sets the username to <code>amnesia</code>, which is a default value not set by the user and therefore safe.</ref>

Many protocol leaks are already documented, see: [[Documentation]] and [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO TorifyHOWTO] for further information.

= Identifiers =

In addition to protocol leaks, there are also a range of identifiers that can be used for fingerprinting by adversaries in order to narrow down the list of potential suspects (for example, the time zone), or even for complete deanonymization (for example, if the user name was set to John Doe). Major and minor identifiers are described below.

== Major Identifiers ==

* [[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]]: The same range exists for all [[Qubes|{{q_project_name}}]] users. ([https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/1143 related ticket])
* [[VirtualBox]] / [[KVM]]: This is the same for all {{project name}} users.<ref>

! scope="row"| Long host name (FQDN)
| The long host name (FQDN) is set to host.localdomain <ref>To check the long host name, run.
<pre>

|-
! scope="row"| MAC address
| The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address MAC address] is different from the host. <ref>
To check {{workstation_product_name}}'s MAC address, run. 

<pre>
sudo ifconfig | grep HWaddr
</pre>

Inside {{workstation_product_name}} and then compare it with the host.
</ref> <ref>
Disadvantages of shared MAC Addresses:

* [[Multiple_{{workstation_product_name_short}}|Multiple {{workstation_product_name}}]] cannot use the Internet at the same time if they are using the same MAC address. It leads to confusing connection interruptions in either of the virtual machines.
* There are minimal advantages of sharing MAC addresses among all {{project name}} versions. (That would be useful in the event an application leaks the MAC address or if {{workstation_product_name}} was compromised.)
* The project contributors need to explain and defend the design, which takes a lot of time for little gain. (Again, it is important not to expose the host's real MAC address, but so long as the one inside the virtual machine is different, everything is in an acceptable state.)
</ref> <ref>
Advantages of shared MAC addresses:

* It may be easier to develop [[Connections_between_{{gateway_product_name_short}}_and_{{workstation_product_name_short}}#ARP_spoofing_defense|ARP spoofing defense]] to implement authenticated connections between {{gateway_product_name}} and {{workstation_product_name}}. (This is only useful when using [[Multiple {{workstation_product_name_short}}|Multiple {{workstation_product_name}}]].) To understand the context, please read [[Connections_between_{{gateway_product_name_short}}_and_{{workstation_product_name_short}}]].
* In some cases, applications gather the MAC address and send it to a remote server (proprietary license checks use the MAC for hardware fingerprinting). In this case a shared MAC address might be better for privacy. It however might also break the proprietary license check as this expects different MAC addresses for different customers of the proprietary software.
</ref>
|-
! scope="row"| Operating system updates
| Operating system (apt-get) updates are routed through their own circuit ([[Stream Isolation]]) to prevent accidental leakage of software packages and versions (if any custom software is installed) which could then be correlated with other anonymous activity. Also see: [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO#Softwareupdaters Software updaters] and [[Install Software | Software installation {{workstation_product_name}}]].
|-
! scope="row" | RAM
| In the worst case scenario, if RAM contents are leaked -- such as error reporting software phoning home, RAM dump if infected with malware, or [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransparentProxyLeaks Transparent Proxy Leaks]) -- this would "only" contain the RAM of the {{workstation_product_name}}. All non-anonymous material on the host remains safe.
|-
! scope="row"| Time
| 
* {{workstation_product_name}}, {{gateway_product_name}} and the host time are all different from each other.
* Time zone (local time) is set to UTC. <ref>
To check the time zone, run. 

<pre>
cat /etc/timezone
</pre>
</ref>
* The hardware clock is set to UTC.
* See [[TimeSync|{{project name}} Time Synchronization Mechanism]] for further information.

! scope="row"| User name
| The user name is set to <code>user</code>.

== Minor Identifiers ==

These identifiers are less important because an adversary can only collect them if the user installed malicious software (for example, some copyright enforcement and anti-cheat tools collect them), or if the adversary achieves remote access by compromising a user or in some cases the root account.

This is due to the design of virtualization platforms (VirtualBox, VMware, etc.). Most virtualization platforms leak CPU model, capabilities and clock speed. Check.

cat /proc/cpuinfo

If that is a still problem for you another workaround could be to use an emulator, such as QEMU (port available, documented, see [[QEMU]]) or [http://bochs.sourceforge.net/ bochs] (no one has created a port yet, undocumented). Unfortunately such emulators are slow and there might be other limitations. (Does Bochs support internal networking?)

= Identifiers Design Goals =
(In response to [https://www.reddit.com/r/Whonix/comments/lrk2v0/some_linux_systems_including_whonix_have_a_unique/ Some Linux systems (including Whonix) have a unique identifier called machine-id that doesn't change. Here is how to change it.])

Should identifiers such as <code>/etc/machine-id</code>:

* '''A)''' be shared among all {{project name}} users all the time, OR
* '''B)''' be unique per user per boot?

{{project name}} design, at time of writing, it is A). <ref>
https://github.com/Whonix/dist-base-files
</ref> It may be possible that arguments for either option could be made. However, upon consideration it seems clear that A) is clearly better.

The threat model is here that software running inside {{Workstation product name}} might read machine id and send it to remote servers which would then use it to fingerprint the user. That could be considered privacy invasive software which should be avoided or even malicious software.

A) leaks "it is a {{project name}} user". But the fact that "it is a {{project name}} user" is being leaked is realistically unavoidable anyhow. For details, why that is, refer to the [[VM Fingerprinting]] wiki page. This is a general issue and unspecific to {{project name}}. If an application or malware intents to track users, such applications in most cases could generate their own unique ID for tracking purposes. Therefore taming identifiers such as <code>/etc/machine-id</code> does not help much.

The approach of Tor and the Tor Browser Bundle is also similar to A). Tor and Tor Browser do not attempt to create a fresh, random pseudonym per session. Rather, Tor and Tor Browser attempt to make all users look the same. The Tor Project coined this <code>Anonymity Loves Company</code> (good web search term). {{project name}} attempts to be an extension of Tor. Therefore follows similar design principles.

B) Would not leak "it is a {{project name}} user" but then attempting to hide that is realistically impossible anyhow as per [[VM Fingerprinting]].

There is also an optimization conflict of perfect fingerprinting resistance against locally running malware versus security hardening settings. Security hardening of the system unfortunately leaks the fact (fingerprintable) that the system has been hardened. Once cannot have both, perfect fingerprinting resistance and security hardening at the same time. Since perfect local fingerprinting resistance cannot realistically be established, {{project name}} will choose security hardening whenever there is such a conflict.

When not using VMs: locally running privacy invasive / malicious software has even more possibilities of fingerprinting users. Direct access to hardware identifiers.
