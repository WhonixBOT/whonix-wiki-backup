}}
__FORCETOC__
= Conclusion =
Initial impression:

* Mostly applicable to governmental or enterprise environments.
* Whonix / Kicksecure is not an enterprise operating system yet. Such a flavor might be possible in future if an enterprise pays for implementation of these features / such a flavor.
* Lots of false positives.
* Doesn't test for and/or find anything catastrophic such as remote exploitable vulnerabilities.
* Would still be useful to work through the list and add comments for any reported failure.

Probably porting issue. [https://github.com/hardenedlinux/STIG-4-Debian/blob/master/scripts/check-package-verify.sh check-package-verify.sh] does not test anything security relevant.

<pre>
[ FAIL ] The operating system must have the screen package installed.
</pre>
Not security relevant.

<pre>
[ FAIL ] When passwords are changed or new passwords are established, the new password must contain at least one upper-case character.
[ FAIL ] When passwords are changed or new passwords are established, the new password must contain at least one lower-case character.
[ FAIL ] When passwords are changed or new passwords are assigned, the new password must contain at least one numeric character.
[ FAIL ] When passwords are changed or new passwords are assigned, the new password must contain at least one special character.
[ FAIL ] When passwords are changed a minimum of eight of the total number of characters must be changed.
[ FAIL ] When passwords are changed a minimum of four character classes must be changed.
[ FAIL ] When passwords are changed the number of repeating consecutive characters must not be more than four characters.
[ FAIL ] When passwords are changed the number of repeating characters of the same character class must not be more than four characters.

[1] Defended in other ways. See [[Dev/Permissions]]. Unclear rationale. Discussed here: https://forums.whonix.org/t/enforce-minimum-password-strength-pam-cracklib/8972/4

<pre>
[ PASS ] The PAM system service must be configured to store only encrypted representations of passwords.
</pre>

TODO

<pre>
[ PASS ] The shadow file must be configured to store only encrypted representations of passwords.
</pre>

TODO

<pre>
[ FAIL ] Passwords for new users must be restricted to a 24 hours/1 day minimum lifetime.
[ FAIL ] Passwords must be restricted to a 24 hours/1 day minimum lifetime.
[ PASS ] Passwords for new users must be restricted to a 60-day maximum lifetime.
[ FAIL ] Existing passwords must be restricted to a 60-day maximum lifetime.
[ FAIL ] Passwords must be prohibited from reuse for a minimum of five generations.
[ FAIL ] Passwords must be a minimum of 15 characters in length.
</pre>
Same as [1].

<pre>
[ FAIL ] The system must not have accounts configured with blank or null passwords.
</pre>

TODO

<pre>
[ FAIL ] The SSH daemon must not allow authentication using an empty password.
</pre>

[2] Not applicable. SSH is not installed by default.

<pre>
[ FAIL ] The operating system must disable account identifiers (individuals, groups, roles, and devices) if the password expires.

Same as [1].

Expiry limits would likely just annoy users. This might be more useful in an enterprise context where shoulder surfing might be an issue.

TODO: document shoulder surfing

<pre>
[ FAIL ] Accounts subject to three unsuccessful logon attempts within 15 minutes must be locked for the maximum configurable period.
</pre>

Same as [1].

Set to 50 before unlockk procedure is required. 50 attempts is far to less for bruteforce.

Setting it to 3 might fall victim to some bugs. There are cases involving sudo where 1 login attempt is recognized as 3 due to pasting text by mistake into the terminal emulator. We might incrementally lower 50 over the releases if that seems worthwhile but not to 3. Can be discussed in https://forums.whonix.org/t/protect-linux-user-accounts-against-brute-force-attacks/7698

<pre>
[ FAIL ] If three unsuccessful root logon attempts within 15 minutes occur the associated account must be locked.
