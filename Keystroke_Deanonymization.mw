Update: [https://forums.whonix.org/t/kloak-keystroke-anonymization-tool/7089 A new version of kloak is available since March 2019]. Kloak now runs as a service and is readily installable from {{project name}} repos. It will be installed in {{project name}} 15 by default. We recommend installing it on the host however so it remains effective in event of Workstation VM compromise. If you need to access accounts (for example banking) that enforce keystroke biometrics, then it may be a good idea to just limit installation to {{project name}} VMs. Planned future developments will focus on obfuscating unique mouse movement behavior to protect user anonymity.
