Update: A new version of kloak is available since March 2019. Kloak now runs as a service and is readily installable from Whonix repos. It will be installed in Whonix 15 by default. We recommend installing it on the host however so it remains effective in event of Workstation VM compromise. Planned future developments will focus on obfuscating unique mouse movement behavior to protect user anonymity.
