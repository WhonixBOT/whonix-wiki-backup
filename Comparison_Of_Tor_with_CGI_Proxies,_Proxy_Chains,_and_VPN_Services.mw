= Tor and Proxies Comparison =

Proxies are famous for "anonymity on demand". Acting as an intermediary, proxy servers relay your traffic to the destination and send the answer back to you so that the destination server ''potentially'' only sees the proxy and not your IP address: <ref name=proxy_server>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server</ref>
<blockquote>Instead of connecting directly to a server that can fulfill a requested resource, such as a file or web page for example, the client directs the request to the proxy server, which evaluates the request and performs the required network transactions. This serves as a method to simplify or control the complexity of the request, or provide additional benefits such as load balancing, privacy, or security. Proxies were devised to add structure and encapsulation to distributed systems.</blockquote>

There are two basic types of proxy server: <ref name=proxy_server />
* <u>Open proxies</u>: these forward requests from and to anywhere on the Internet and are accessible by any Internet user. <ref>Hundreds of thousands are suspected to be in operation.</ref>
** Anonymous proxies reveal their identity as a proxy server but do not disclose the client's originating IP address.
** Transparent proxies also reveal their identity as a proxy server, but the originating IP address is accessible due to factors such as the <code>X-Forwarded-For</code> HTTP header. The benefit of these proxies is the ability to cache websites for faster retrieval.
* <u>Reverse proxies</u>: these connect the Internet to an internal network. Therefore, users making requests connect to the proxy and may not be aware of the internal network as the response is returned as if it came from the original server.

There are no known HTTP(S) or SOCKS4(a)/5 proxies that offer an encrypted connection between itself and the user. Therefore, the Internet Service Provider or any [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack man-in-the-middle] can see connection details, including the destination IP address. If the destination server is not using [[SSL|SSL/TLS]], then the entire content of traffic is vulnerable as well.

As noted above, some open HTTP(S) proxies send the "HTTP forwarded for" header which discloses a user's IP address. HTTP(S) proxies that do not send this header are sometimes called "elite" or "anonymous" proxies. There are no known legitimate and free public HTTP(S) or SOCKS4(a)/5 proxies.

== Conclusion ==

Proxies are highly susceptible to the misuse and theft of user data: many proxies (HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS) are computers that have been hijacked by hackers or criminals, or are honeypots exclusively offered for the purpose of user observation. Even if they were legitimate, any single operator can decide to enable logging. In addition, some proxies automatically reveal the user's IP address to the destination server.

At best, proxies only offer weak protection against destination website logging, and they offer no protection against third party eavesdropping. For these reasons their use is strongly discouraged.

= {{project_name}}, Tails, Tor Browser and CGIproxies Comparison =

== Introduction ==

This section compares the use of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CGI_proxy#CGI_proxy CGIproxies] in Mozilla Firefox on the host without utilizing a platform like {{project name}} or Tails. A CGI web proxy: <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CGI_proxy#CGI_proxy</ref>
<blockquote>... accepts target URLs using a Web form in the user's browser window, processes the request, and returns the results to the user's browser. Consequently, it can be used on a device or network that does not allow "true" proxy settings to be changed.</blockquote>

This means CGIproxies provide Internet pages with a form field in which the user can input the target address they wish to visit anonymously. The web proxy subsequently delivers the content of the requested website and automatically patches all links to use the web proxy when clicked. When using web proxy services the browser configuration does not need to be changed.

In comparison to network proxies, CGIproxies have the disadvantage of not being able to replace each link correctly, in particular on websites with JavaScript code. This makes it easier for the user's IP address to "leak" to the web server, which the proxy should actually prevent. The https://ip-check.info anonymity test displays the weakness of some web proxies in the comparison table below.

It is also important to note that CGIproxies can ''potentially'' only anonymize browser traffic and not the traffic of other applications; but to be fair, they do not claim more than anonymizing browser traffic.

== Comparison Tables ==

== Conclusion ==

In comparison to Tor, CGIproxies are only a one hop proxies, thus they know who is connecting and where the user connects to. They could read all transmissions, even if entering SSL protected domain names. This makes them much inferior to Tor.

Due to these disadvantages, other security features, which have been discussed above in chapter comparison of {{project_name}}, Tails and Tor Browser, such as UTC timezone, fingerprinting didn't appear worthwhile to compare.

= Tor and Proxy Chains Comparison =

== Aren't 10 proxies (proxychains) better than Tor with only 3 hops? - proxychains vs Tor ==
Maybe you've seen the funny picture "I am behind 10 proxies, so what?". Nevermind.

10 open proxies are not as secure as Tor. Many people are not aware of that.

As outlined [[#Comparison of Tor and Proxies|above]], proxies are not very secure.

With Tor the first hop won't see the IP of the last hop because it can't decrypt the message for the second hop. If one hop can be trusted, the connection is secure. (See [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorFAQ#WhichTornodeknowswhat Which Tor node knows what?] and the onion design.)

Even if you are using "elite" or "anonymous" proxies... Or even Socks Proxies...

* All connections between you and all proxies are unencrypted.
* This has nothing to do with SSL, but for demonstration, let's assume you are connecting to an SSL protected web server.
* In human understandable form, this is a sketch how the package for the first proxy in your chain of 5 would look like:
* Hey Proxy1, can you please forward "forward to Proxy3; forward to Proxy4; forward to Proxy5; forward to https://encrypted.google.com 'c8e8df895c2cae-some-garbage-here-(encrypted)-166bad027fdf15335b'" to Proxy2? Thanks!
* You see, your actual transmission will be safely encrypted and can be only decrypted by the https protected webserver, but every proxy will see its predecessor IP and all successor IP's.
* There is no way to encrypt that information, no way to make your own onion. The proxy protocols (http(s), socks4(a)/5) do not support encryption.

As you would have to trust any of them the IP of all its successors... The second question about open proxies is, who hosts them?

* most of them are a simple misconfiguration, the owners are not aware of it and do not want the public to use them
* many of them are compromised machines (worm infected)
* some are honeypots, logging or exploiting (dns spoofing, protocol spoofing, ssl spoofing)
* few of them are from generous people who just want your best and give you anonymity (similar to most Tor server admins)

This must not apply for proxychains of SSH and/or encrypted VPN servers - has not been researched yet. But you can not get so many SSH and/or VPN servers for free (without hacking of course) and/or anonymous payment anyway.

= Tor and VPN Services Comparison =

== Comparison ==

If you run the VPN software directly on the same machine as also the client software such as web browser runs, [[Data_Collection_Techniques#Active_Web_Contents|Active Web Contents]] can read your real IP address. This can be prevented, if you use a virtual or physical VPN-Gateway or your router. However, please note that active contents may still read a lot of data about your computer and network configuration.

* Some providers force the user to use their proprietary closed source software and have no option to allow being used by reputable VPN software, such as OpenVPN.
* On one hand, their software usually does not ensure, that users also have an uniform appearance on the Web aside their IP address (see [[Data Collection Techniques]]). The users are thus distinguishable and easily identifiable by merging the data.
* And on the other hand, a local observer on your network (ISP, WLAN) could guesstimate websites requested over VPN simply by analyzing size and timing of the encrypted VPN data stream (Website Fingerprinting Attacks). Tor is quite resilient against this attack (a scientific article which demonstrates the attack is found [http://epub.uni-regensburg.de/11919/1/authorsversion-ccsw09.pdf here]; the success rates are over 90% for VPNs).
* Moreover, VPN systems, as inherent to their functional principle, normally do not filter or replace your computer's TCP packets. They thereby do not protect you from [[Data_Collection_Techniques#TCP_Timestamps|TCP timestamp attacks]] as Tor does.
* Even when using a virtual or physical VPN-Gateway, due to browser fingerprinting problems it is only [[DoNot#Do_not_confuse_Anonymity_with_Pseudonymity.|pseudonymous rather than anonymous]].
* Its trivial to trick client applications behind a VPN to connect in the clear. <ref>https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/foci12/foci12-final8.pdf</ref>
* Most VPNs fail open and don't configure basic crypto properly - if they even use a proper cipher at all.<ref>https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/foci12/foci12-final8.pdf</ref>
* The Snowden Documents describes a successful internet-wide campaign by advanced adversaries for covert access to VPN providers' servers.<ref>https://search.edwardsnowden.com/docs/VPNandVOIPExploitationWithHAMMERCHANTandHAMMERSTEIN20140312</ref>
* You should also keep in mind that VPN hosts can, unlike Tor, track and save every step of yours, since they control all servers in the VPN. They and anyone else who has access to their servers, either knowingly or unknowingly, will have this information as well.
* VPN providers only offer privacy by policy, while Tor offers privacy by design. A VPN provider can claim not to log, but you'll never know until it is too late. When using Tor, you also never know, if any of the three hops keeps logs. One malicious node will have less impact. The entry guard will not know where you are connecting to, thus it is not a fatal problem if they log. The exit relay won't know who you are, but can see your unencrypted traffic, which can be a problem if you send sensitive data (which you are advised not to do), but if you act accordingly, it is not a problem. It is unlikely (thus not impossible), that you choose a circuit where an adversary controls all three nodes. However, while using VPN providers you're putting all trust into the policy of one provider, using Tor distributes trust.
* Don't get fooled by advertisements for Double, Triple or Multi Hop VPNs. Unless it is the user, who builds its own custom VPN chain by carefully choosing different VPN providers, owned by different companies, you're still fully trusting only one provider.

Whether it is worth to combine Tor with a VPN, either as pre-Tor-VPN (user &rarr; VPN &rarr; Tor) or as post-Tor-VPN (user &rarr; Tor &rarr; VPN) is quite a controversial topic and discussed on the [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN Tor plus VPN] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6FPudSpvr w]) page. In case you decide to do so, it is easy with {{project_name}}, see [[Features#VPN_.2F_Tunnel_support|VPN/Tunnel Support]].
