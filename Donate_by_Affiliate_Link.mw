= Short Overview =
A referral link looks like a normal link but contains a unique identification code that tracks who refereed the user to the vendor. Referral links are very common on the internet. Often users are unaware that they are using referral links. Users usually perform web searches, find websites, blogs or forums that contain links to vendors or services that the user is interested in at the time. Often these links are referral links.

Instead of leaving it to random chance who receives a commission, if the user is intending to purchase from a vendor or to use a paid web-service anyhow, the user could consider to use an affiliate link provided by {{project name}}. This might result in redirecting any commissions to {{project name}} instead. This is a different type of donation. The user does not have to spend any extra money.

= Instructions =
'''1.''' The user should do their own research if use of the third party vendor is secure.

'''2.''' The user clicks a link from this Donate by Affiliate wiki page.

'''3.''' The user makes a purchase directly from the affiliated third party.

'''4.''' Done.

[[Warning#Unsubstantiated Conclusions|Unsubstantiated Conclusions]] conclusions should be avoided.
* <u>No relationship</u>: Using a not using an affiliate link does not get {{project name}} project involved into the transaction. The user will not notice any difference.
* <u>No refunds</u>: While the third party vendor may or may not have return policy and/or refund policy, under no circumstances can any commissions which might be received by {{project name}} be redirected to the user.
* <u>Not a guaranteed commission</u>: Note, it is not guaranteed that {{project name}} will receive a commission. There are many reasons why {{project name}} will not receive a commission. <ref>
* Technical issues by the affiliate.
