'''Note: Most existing instant messenger protocols are unsafe from a privacy point of view. This is not a Whonix specific problem. It is a general problem with instant messengers.'''

[[Warning#Tor_exit_nodes_can_eavesdrop_on_communications|Tor Exit Node eavesdropping]] can happen if no encryption to the server is enabled. Some protocols have encryption disabled by default, some do not support encryption at all. See also [https://tails.boum.org/todo/Pidgin_Protocol_Review/ Overview about Pidgin protocols and their encryption features]<ref>http://archive.is/8w0Zf</ref>. If encryption to the server is enabled, the Tor Exit Node can no longer eavesdrop. This fixes one problem, however it also leaves another problem unresolved.

Even with encryption to the server enabled, the server could still gather interesting information.
For example:
* Account names
* Buddy list (list of contacts)
* Log login dates and times
* Timestamp of messages
* Who communicates with whom
** If the recipient knows the sender and the recipient uses a non-anonymous account or the recipient ever logged in without Tor, this can be used as a hint for determining who the sender is.
* Content of messages - Can be prevented using end-to-end encryption. This is covered in [[Chat#OTR_encryption|OTR encryption]] below.


Jabber/XMPP is a server-federation-based protocol designed with openness in mind. Its security depends on you making good use of OTR as you can never be sure if servers are properly encrypted between each other. Privacy with Jabber is limited, as it is visible to various kinds of attackers who your account is talking to. Tor only helps to pseudonymize your account and hide your current location, but your social graph may still expose your identity. For a good operational security guide on chatting anonymously see [https://theintercept.com/2015/07/14/communicating-secret-watched/ The Intercept's] [https://archive.is/n116i article].

Systems which do not require a server by design, i.e. serverless instant messengers are likely better from a privacy point of view. Such systems are [[#RetroShare]] and [[#Tox]].

= Ricochet IM =
Ricochet IM<ref>https://ricochet.im/</ref> is a new successor of the unmaintained TorChat. <ref>
https://github.com/ricochet-im/ricochet/issues/30
</ref>

It is a portable P2P python chat application that does not save chat history. It relies on Tor onion services for creating identities. Its encryption and authentication properties are as strong as Tor's. No metadata is ever collected because it is server-less. An OTF sponsored audit in early 2016 shows that there were a few minor problems (fixed since).<ref>https://ricochet.im/files/ricochet-ncc-audit-2016-01.pdf</ref><ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricochet_(software)</ref>

Should work. Please test and [https://phabricator.whonix.org/T444 report] if it's working.

= RetroShare =
[http://retroshare.sourceforge.net RetroShare] is not an [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymizer anonymizing network], it is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friend-to-friend friend-to-friend] (F2F) network, or optionally a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet darknet]. RetroShare has a very different audience and threat model.

RetroShare is in active development. Users can operate servers for themselves, but the architecture doesn't depend on them. Communications are encrypted end-to-end and provide for messaging, mail, forums, pubsub, file exchange and even telephony. The problems with RetroShare are the confused user interface, the necessity to have it run most of the time and contribute to the distributed hashtable (DHT, causing continuous CPU usage) and three relevant privacy aspects: You expose your social graph to a global passive adversary because friends connect to friends directly. Your public IP is available in the DHT, allowing to track your physical locations. And your visible user name is exposed in the TLS certificate when somebody connects to your RetroShare node.

Several of these problems can be solved by disabling the built-in DHT and hiding RetroShare behind a Tor onion service. People who scan Tor onion services will however still be able to connect the service and see the RetroShare user name in the self-signed certificate. This can be prevented by setting up [[Onion_Services#Onion_Service_Authentication|Authenticated Onion Services]] and limiting connections only to trusted people.

On November 4, 2014, RetroShare scored 6 out of 7 points on the Electronic Frontier Foundation's secure messaging scorecard. It lost a point because there has not been an independent code audit.<ref>https://www.eff.org/secure-messaging-scorecard</ref> A recent audit by the pen-testing group Elttam uncovered many bugs in the code (some remotely exploitable) that were promptly fixed. The auditor's opinion was that RetroShare's codebase lacked secure coding practice.<ref>https://www.elttam.com.au/blog/a-review-of-the-eff-secure-messaging-scorecard-pt1/</ref>

Running RetroShare through Tor enables you, to do things, which are normally potentially dangerous, such as adding random people (from a forum), while staying anonymous. (For example, to join a RetroShare forum.) This is '''not''' a recommendation, just stating a possibility. You can exchange your key on dedicated chat servers at: https://retroshare.rocks/

After adding tons of random "friends" from a public forum, connection to a very few people over TCP. <ref>Chance of working better ('''untested'''): [[Tunnel UDP over Tor]].</ref> <ref>Note, in case you are using the previous footnote, [[Security_Guide#Other_Anonymizing_Networks_over_Tor_UDP_Tunnel|Other Anonymizing Networks over Tor UDP Tunnel]] applies.</ref> Approximately only 5% were online. Although probably only a very small portion of the network could be seen, the content of the network looked pretty interesting.

There still may be some privacy caveats left with RetroShare trying to communicate outside of Tor, but that doesn't matter if Whonix makes any non-Tor traffic impossible.

== Installation and Setup ==
'''WARNING: RetroShare packages are signed with [https://github.com/RetroShare/RetroShare/issues/355 weak] 1024 bit keys. Until this is fixed we recommend using Ricochet IM with OnionShare instead.'''

{{Third_Party_Repository}}

''RetroShare is currently available on Debian 7.0 Wheezy and 6.0 Squeeze for armel, armhf, i386 and amd64 architectures and for 8.0 Jessie.''

Before adding the repo<ref>http://retroshare.sourceforge.net/downloads.html</ref>, fetch the key and verify<ref>http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/AsamK:/RetroShare/Debian_8.0/Release.gpg</ref> fingerprints. Always check the fingerprint for yourself. The output at the moment is:

<pre>
pub  1024D/0x9418A47921691F91 2011-08-16 home:AsamK OBS Project <home:AsamK@build.opensuse.org>
      Key fingerprint = E2CE 3677 C801 5772 D097  B0AA 9418 A479 2169 1F91
</pre>

Download key with curl to home folder.

{{CodeSelect|code=
curl -o retroshare-pubkey.asc http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/AsamK:/RetroShare/Debian_8.0/Release.key
}}

Check fingerprints/owners without importing anything.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --keyid-format long --with-fingerprint retroshare-pubkey.asc
}}

If it looks good import into trusted.gpg.d.<ref>To import asc key files into trusted.gpg.d they must be converted into a .gpg keychain file first.</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-key --keyring /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/retroshare-pubkey.gpg add retroshare-pubkey.asc
}}

For stable builds:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo su -c "echo -e 'deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/AsamK:/RetroShare/Debian_8.0/ /' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/retroshare06.list"
}}

For nightly builds:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo su -c "echo -e 'deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/AsamK:/RetroShare/Debian_8.0/ /' > /etc/apt/retroshare06-git.list"
}}

{{Update}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}

Install Retroshare.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install retroshare06
}}

For the latest nightly package name install <code>retroshare06-git</code> instead.

<ref>
[http://retroshare.sourceforge.net/downloads.html RetroShare .deb Packages installation instructions from RetroShare's third party repository]

RetroShare setup:

* Pick a pseudonym and password. Don't use real name or location obviously. Move your mouse to generate enough entropy.
* Check ''Advanced Options'' -> ''Create a hidden node''
* Change key-length to 4096 bits for adequate security then generate the new profile.

= Deprecated Chat Clients =
== Tor Messenger ==
No longer use! Deprecated by upstream developers. <ref>

* [[Deprecated#Tor_Messenger]]
* http://forums.whonix.org/t/tor-messenger-is-no-longer-maintained-as-of-march-2018
</ref>

== Pidgin ==
Pidgin supports most protocols. However do not use it. It has a very bad security track record with many remotely exploitable bugs -  a result of being written in C and containing many legacy protocols. <ref>
https://pidgin.im/news/security/
</ref>

== TorChat ==
Unfortunately, since time of writing (September 2015) TorChat can not be recommended. This is because the TorChat developer currently does not respond to other people, see [https://github.com/prof7bit/TorChat/issues TorChat issues]. Communication and support is crucial for anonymity related projects. TorChat is an unofficial project. Unaffiliated with The Tor Project. A modern and maintained alternative is Ricochet IM.

In 2015 security analysis<ref>[http://kodu.ut.ee/~arnis/torchat_thesis.pdf Security Analysis of Instant Messenger TorChat]</ref> of TorChat protocol and its Python implementation was conducted. It was found that although the design of TorChat is sound, its implementation has several flaws, which make TorChat users vulnerable to impersonation, communication confirmation and denial-of-service attacks.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TorChat#Security</ref>

= Other Software =
If it is not listed here, it for now is recommended against. You can search [https://forums.whonix.org/ Whonix forums] to see if that chat client has been discussed in past or if you think a privacy respecting chat client is missing on this page.
