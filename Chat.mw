It is recommended to review the [[DoNot#Mix_Anonymity_Modes|Do not Mix Anonymity Modes]] section in conjunction with this entry. For a comprehensive comparison of instant messengers, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_instant_messaging_clients see here].

== Encryption ==

[[Warning#Tor_Exit_Relays_can_Eavesdrop_on_Communications|Tor exit relays can eavesdrop]] on communications if encryption to the server is disabled. Depending on the protocol, encryption might be disabled by default or not even supported. Tails has noted that without encryption, the exit relay can see the contact list, all messages, file transfers, and audio/video. <ref>See: https://tails.boum.org/todo/Pidgin_Protocol_Review/ for an overview of Pidgin protocols and associated encryption features.</ref> While encryption to the server prevents exit relay eavesdropping, it still leaves one problem unresolved: server logging.

High-risk users should also bear in mind that even in the event that strong and secure end-to-end encryption is used -- for example encrypted chat using .onion connections only (staying within the Tor network) -- sophisticated attackers (nation state actors) are capable of compromising the trusted computing base (TCB) <ref>"... the trusted computing base or TCB comprises the set of all hardware, software, and firmware components that are critical to establishing and maintaining its security. Typically, the TCB consists of an operating system with all its in-built security controls, individual system hardware, network hardware and software, defined security procedures and protocols, and the actual physical location of the system itself." [https://blog.finjan.com/trusted-computing-base/ Trusted Computing Base or "TCB"]</ref> of nearly all platforms: <ref>https://github.com/maqp/tfc/wiki/Security-design#the-issue-of-endpoint-security</ref>
<blockquote>
All proper end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) messaging systems store private key(s) exclusively on user's device (endpoint). The holy grail of attacks against E2EE systems is called exfiltration where the sensitive data, namely the private keys or plaintext messages, are stolen from the endpoint. The attack is directed against the trusted computing base (TCB) of the target system. The overwhelming majority of TCBs are connected to the network and compromising them with polished malware that exploits a zero-day vulnerability, is trivial and undetectable.
</blockquote>

== Server Logging ==

Encrypted server connections do not prevent the server gathering interesting information about users, such as common contacts and the regularity of communications. An example list includes: 

* Account names.
* Buddy list (list of contacts).
* The exact date and time of logins.
* Message timestamps.
* Communication patterns like common contacts.
** If the recipient knows the sender and has ever used a non-anonymous account or logged in without Tor, this information can be used to try and determine the sender's identity.

The content of messages will only be protected by using end-to-end encryption, for example [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-Record_Messaging Off-the-Record (OTR) encryption]. To completely remove the threat of server logging, prefer decentralized (server-less) instant messengers like [[#Ricochet_IM|Ricochet IM]].

== Jabber / XMPP ==

[https://xmpp.org/ Jabber/XMPP] is a free server-federation-based protocol designed with openness in mind: "''... All of the existing XMPP servers, clients, and programming libraries support the key features of an IM system, such as one-to-one and multi-party messaging, presence subscriptions and notifications, and contact lists.''" 

The system is decentralized because there is no central authoritative server; anyone can run a server. Some users are confused on this point because there are a number of large and popular public XMPP servers (like jabber.org), to which many have subscribed. <ref>Other popular public servers are listed [https://xmpp.org/getting-started/ here].</ref> Each network user has a unique XMPP address called a JID (Jabber ID). The JID is similar to an email address insofar as it has a username and domain name like username@example.com <ref name=Xmpp>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xmpp</ref> 

Safely using the protocol requires proper use of OTR, because it is unwise to trust server connections are properly encrypted between each other. Jabber privacy is also limited, as various adversaries are capable of observing which accounts are communicating. Jabber and Tor combined only guarantee pseudonymous communications, as while the user's current location is hidden, the social graph can still expose their true identity. For tips on operational security when chatting anonymously, see this [https://archive.is/n116i article] by [https://theintercept.com/2015/07/14/communicating-secret-watched/ The Intercept]. Also see: [https://forums.whonix.org/t/why-is-icq-considered-unsafe-through-tor/1096 Why prefer open protocols such as Jabber/XMPP over proprietary ones such as ICQ?]

== IRC ==

When using IRC inside {{workstation_product_name}}, the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ident_protocol Ident Protocol] is automatically blocked because {{workstation_product_name}} is firewalled. Therefore the associated daemon will not identify the username which is linked with a particular TCP connection, as is normally the case.

The Tor Project [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/IRC Internet Relay Chat] page contains a number of important recommendations and tips for safe IRC use:

* Use onion services when available.
** Check self-signed certificates have the correct SSL/TLS certificate.
* Cycle Tor circuits to evade censorship bans.
* Chain VPNs and Tor for registration.
* Use OTR for end-to-end encryption.
* Distrust users and servers in general.
* Avoid personally identifiable information in chats.
* Check the user fingerprint before using IRC.
* Harden the IRC client.
* And more.

= Recommendation =
Applications discussed in this chapter are listed in order of best usability and compatibility with {{project_name}}, based on the opinion and experience of {{project name}} developers.

It should be noted that no single application listed here has a superior feature set. Users must make a choice based on personal preferences and their self-assessed threat model:

# [[#Gajim|Gajim]] has better usability, more Jabber users, supports offline messages, and can provide OTR or OMEMO-grade encryption. On the downside, it requires a Jabber server which weakens anonymity.
# [[#HexChat:_IRC_Client|HexChat]] is an open source IRC client based on XChat (therefore not technically an instant messenger). It has better usability and supports encrypted plugins like OTR, but on the downside it relies on centralized IRC servers.
# [[#Ricochet IM|Ricochet IM]] is a decentralized (server-less) option, but it "only" uses onion encryption and is difficult to set up. OTR or OMEMO-grade encryption is not yet available, <ref>https://github.com/ricochet-im/ricochet/issues/72</ref> and offline messages are not supported. <ref>https://github.com/ricochet-im/ricochet/issues/405</ref> Ricochet IM is also not user-friendly.
# [[#Tox|Tox]] is also a fully-featured, decentralized (server-less) option which employs strong encryption, but the software is in alpha status and is not available as a Debian package. <ref>Tox has not yet been formally audited by security professionals, but this is the case for most software. Further, passing a formal audit does not guarantee that the software is in fact safe.</ref> Tox developers warn in their wiki: ''"... Keep in mind that these clients are alpha software under heavy development, and are probably not ready for day-to-day use. ..."'' <ref>https://wiki.tox.chat/binaries</ref>

= Gajim =

[[File:gajim234234.png|100px]]

== Overview ==

Ubuntu provides a succinct overview of Gajim: <ref>https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Gajim</ref>

<blockquote>Gajim is a free software, instant messaging client for the Jabber (XMPP) protocol which uses the GTK+ toolkit. It runs on GNU/Linux, BSD and Windows. The name Gajim is a recursive acronym for Gajim (is) a jabber instant messenger.

The goal of Gajim is to provide a full featured and easy to use Jabber client. Gajim works nicely with GNOME, but does not require it to run. It is released under the GNU General Public License. </blockquote>

Gajim has various features, including: <ref>https://gajim.org/</ref>
* Chat client synchronization.
* Group chats.
* Sending of pictures, videos and other files to friends or groups.
* Secure end-to-end encryption via OMEMO or PGP.
* The option to keep and manage all chat history.
* Connection compatibility with other messengers via transports, such as IRC.
* Various other features are available via plugins.

In late-2018, audio/video is reportedly not functional in Gajim. Further, OTR support was dropped in Gajim release 1.0, but the [https://dev.gajim.org/gajim/gajim-plugins/wikis/OmemoGajimPlugin OMEMO plugin] is an encryption alternative. <ref>https://dev.gajim.org/gajim/gajim/wikis/help/gajimfaq</ref> Note that Debian stretch has [https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=gajim&searchon=names&suite=all&section=all v0.16 of the Gajim package] available, so optionally the [https://dev.gajim.org/gajim/gajim-plugins/wikis/OffTheRecordPlugin OTR plugin] can still be used instead of OMEMO (stretch-backports has v1.1 available).

== Installation ==

{{mbox
| type      = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text       = '''Tip:''' Gajim dependencies and Debian instructions are always available [https://dev.gajim.org/gajim/gajim/blob/master/README.md here].
}}


The steps below install Gajim, along with the OMEMO encryption plugin and [https://dev.gajim.org/gajim/gajim-plugins/wikis/HttpUploadPlugin HTTP Upload plugin] (which is required for file transfers). <ref>Note this feature can be combined with OMEMO for encrypted file transfers.</ref> The latter plugin is fully integrated into the core Gajim software as of v1.0. Upon first launch of the program, users can use an existing [[#Jabber_.2F_XMPP|XMPP account]] or create a new one. 

{{Update}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}

Install gajim, gajim-omemo and gajim-httpupload.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install gajim gajim-omemo gajim-httpupload
}}

Start Gajim from the start menu or type in konsole.

</ref>

== Configuration ==

=== Account ===

On first launch, an Account Creation Wizard Dialog will appear. Use the wizard to either create a new account to connect to the jabber network or use an existing account. For new accounts, there are multiple jabber servers available and only a username and password is required to join. <ref>A new account can always be added with: <code>Edit</code> &rarr; <code>Accounts</code> &rarr; <code>New</code></ref>

=== Gajim Settings ===

The following changes are recommended for better security and privacy.

= Ricochet IM =

[[File:ricochet342344.png|100px]]

== Introduction ==

Ricochet IM is is a portable, P2P, python chat application that is installed in {{project name}} by default. It is the new successor to the unmaintained TorChat. <ref>https://github.com/ricochet-im/ricochet/issues/30</ref> The Ricochet site describes how the application works: <ref>https://ricochet.im/</ref>

<blockquote>Ricochet uses the Tor network to reach your contacts without relying on messaging servers. It creates a hidden service, which is used to rendezvous with your contacts without revealing your location or IP address.

Instead of a username, you get a unique address that looks like ricochet:rs7ce36jsj24ogfw.
Other Ricochet users can use this address to send a contact request - asking to be added to your contacts list.

You can see when your contacts are online, and send them messages (and soon, files!). Your list of contacts is only known to your computer - never exposed to servers or network traffic monitoring.

Everything is encrypted end-to-end, so only the intended recipient can decrypt it, and anonymized, so nobody knows where it’s going and where it came from.</blockquote>

In summary, the benefits of Ricochet IM include:
* No saving of chat history.
* Reliance on Tor onion services for identity creation.
** Encryption and authentication properties therefore match Tor's strength.
* The server-less design means no metadata is ever collected.
* An OTF sponsored audit in early 2016 only identified a few minor problems (since fixed). <ref>https://ricochet.im/files/ricochet-ncc-audit-2016-01.pdf</ref> <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricochet_(software)</ref>

{{onion-grater-warning}}

== {{project name}} Configuration ==

Ricochet should be fully functional in {{project_name}}. If any problems are encountered, please leave comments on the [https://phabricator.whonix.org/T444 open Phabricator ticket].

=== Add a Ricochet Python Profile ===

In {{gateway_product_name}} (<code>sys-whonix</code>), onion-grater requires some adjustments.

{{Control_Port_Filter_Python_Profile_Add
|filename=/usr/share/onion-grater-merger/examples/40_ricochet.yml
|filename_new=/usr/share/doc/onion-grater-merger/examples/40_ricochet.yml
}}

=== Modify Firewall Settings ===

In {{workstation_product_name}} (<code>anon-whonix</code>), the firewall requires some adjustments.

{{Firewall Settings Workstation}}

Add.

{{CodeSelect|code=
EXTERNAL_OPEN_ALL=true
}}

Save.

{{Reload_Firewall_ws}}

== Start Ricochet ==

In {{workstation_product_name}} (<code>anon-whonix</code>), launch ricochet either through the start menu or from the command line.

{{CodeSelect|code=
ricochet
}}

== Backup/Restore Ricochet ID ==
Ricochet identities are ephemeral by design, meaning on program restart, a new identity will be generated and the last one with the added contacts will be lost. This is safer as long lived identities are easier to track over time. However one can preserve a certain username string and re-use it.

Backup <code>ricochet.json</code> in the config directory path below which contains the private key under <code>identity</code> in <code>serviceKey</code>. <ref>
https://github.com/ricochet-im/ricochet/issues/577
</ref>

You need to replace <code>/path/to/backup/location</code> with the actual location of your backup folder.

{{CodeSelect|code=
cp /home/user/.local/share/Ricochet/ricochet/ricochet.json /path/to/backup/location
}}

For now this is enough. Alternatively you could also backup the whole folder <code>/home/user/.local/share/Ricochet</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
cp -r /home/user/.local/share/Ricochet /path/to/backup/location
}}

= Deprecated Chat Clients =

== Pidgin ==
Pidgin supports most protocols and OTR end-to-end encrypted chat. However, it is not recommended because it has a [http://pidgin.im/news/security/ very poor security record] with many remotely exploitable bugs. Security researcher and developer Micah Lee notes this is the result of reliance on legacy protocols and the libpurple, libotr and libxml libraries which are: ''"... massive, written in C/C++, and are littered with memory corruption bugs. ..."'' <ref>https://micahflee.com/2013/02/using-gajim-instead-of-pidgin-for-more-secure-otr-chat/</ref> 

== RetroShare ==
{{project_name}} developers no longer list RetroShare, which is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friend-to-friend friend-to-friend] (peer-to-peer), decentralized network and not an anonymizing network. Encrypted RetroShare  connections support chat, voice and video, mail, file-sharing, forums and Tor. <ref>Unlike other private P2P options, the F2F network can grow in size without compromising their users' identities. Also, passwords or digital signatures are required for authentication.</ref> Although RetroShare is [https://github.com/RetroShare/RetroShare under active development], <ref>See also: https://retroshareteam.wordpress.com/2018/03/13/release-notes-for-v0-6-4/</ref> there are several serious concerns which disqualify a recommendation:

* The RetroShare package is signed with [[RetroShare#Installation|weak 1024-bit keys]] (in late-2018).
* A 2016 code review which focused on implementation vulnerabilities discovered multiple security issues: <ref>https://www.elttam.com.au/blog/a-review-of-the-eff-secure-messaging-scorecard-pt1/</ref>
** The attack surface is high due to the feature-rich codebase.
** Systemic "insecure coding practice" was identified, particularly ''"...inconsistent return value checking and error handling, poor usage of explicit and implicit typecasting, and relaxed handling of adverse security edge-cases."''
** Within a 24-hour period, auditors had developed proof of concept exploits for web-like vulnerabilities, weak binary protections, and out of bound memory reads and remote memory corruption (promptly rectified by developers).
* A coverity scan of the RetroShare code shows a large number of outstanding defects, along with a relatively high defect density. <ref>https://scan.coverity.com/projects/retroshare-retroshare</ref> <ref>For example, compare this result with the low number of defects and defect density of the [https://scan.coverity.com/projects/tor Tor] codebase.</ref>

== TorChat ==
TorChat has not been recommended by {{project name}} developers since late-2015. The reason is [https://github.com/prof7bit/TorChat/issues development has been at a standstill] since 2013 and the TorChat developer does not respond to other people, suggesting the project has been abandoned. TorChat is also an unofficial project and unaffiliated with The Tor Project. Since communication, support, active development and security fixes are essential for anonymity-related projects, Ricochet IM is strongly recommended as a modern, maintained alternative. <ref>Particularly since Ricochet IM passed a recent (2016) security audit with flying colors.</ref>

Another reason to avoid TorChat is the findings of a 2015 security analysis <ref>[http://kodu.ut.ee/~arnis/torchat_thesis.pdf Security Analysis of Instant Messenger TorChat]</ref> which inspected the protocol and Python implementation: <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TorChat#Security</ref>

<blockquote>It was found that although the design of TorChat is sound, its implementation has several flaws, which make TorChat users vulnerable to impersonation, communication confirmation and denial-of-service attacks.</blockquote>

== Tor Messenger ==
Do <u>not</u> use Tor Messenger! It was deprecated by upstream developers in early-2018. <ref>
* https://blog.torproject.org/sunsetting-tor-messenger
