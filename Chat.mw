Recommended knowledge: [[DoNot#Do_not_mix_Modes_of_Anonymity.21|Modes of Anonymity]].

'''Note: Most existing instant messenger protocols are unsafe from a privacy point of view. This is not a Whonix specific problem. It is a general problem with instant messengers.'''

[[Chat#Pidgin|Pidgin]] supports most protocols. However do not use Pidgin. It has a very bad security track record with many remotely exploitable bugs -  a result of being written in C and containing many legacy protocols. There is no reason to use it when Tor Messenger is now available.

[[Warning#Tor_exit_nodes_can_eavesdrop_on_communications|Tor Exit Node eavesdropping]] can happen if no encryption to the server is enabled. Some protocols have encryption disabled by default, some do not support encryption at all. See also [https://tails.boum.org/todo/Pidgin_Protocol_Review/ Overview about Pidgin protocols and their encryption features]<ref>http://archive.is/8w0Zf</ref>. If encryption to the server is enabled, the Tor Exit Node can no longer eavesdrop. This fixes one problem, however it also leaves another problem unresolved.

Even with encryption to the server enabled, the server could still gather interesting information.
For example:
* Account names
* Buddy list (list of contacts)
* Log login dates and times
* Timestamp of messages
* Who communicates with whom
** If the recipient knows the sender and the recipient uses a non-anonymous account or the recipient ever logged in without Tor, this can be used as a hint for determining who the sender is.
* Content of messages - Can be prevented using end-to-end encryption. This is covered in [[Chat#OTR_encryption|OTR encryption]] below.


Jabber/XMPP is a server-federation-based protocol designed with openness in mind. Its security depends on you making good use of OTR as you can never be sure if servers are properly encrypted between each other. Privacy with Jabber is limited, as it is visible to various kinds of attackers who your account is talking to. Tor only helps to pseudonymize your account and hide your current location, but your social graph may still expose your identity. For a good operational security guide on chatting anonymously see [https://theintercept.com/2015/07/14/communicating-secret-watched/ The Intercept's] [https://archive.is/n116i article].

Systems which do not require a server by design, i.e. serverless instant messengers are likely better from a privacy point of view. Such systems are [[Chat#TorChat|TorChat]], [[Chat#RetroShare|RetroShare]] and [[VoIP#Tox|Tox]].

= RetroShare =
[http://retroshare.sourceforge.net RetroShare] is not an [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymizer anonymizing network], it is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friend-to-friend friend-to-friend] (F2F) network, or optionally a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet darknet]. RetroShare has a very different audience and threat model.

RetroShare is in active development. Users can operate servers for themselves, but the architecture doesn't depend on them. Communications are encrypted end-to-end and provide for messaging, mail, forums, pubsub, file exchange and even telephony. The problems with RetroShare are the confused user interface, the necessity to have it run most of the time and contribute to the distributed hashtable (DHT, causing continuous CPU usage) and three relevant privacy aspects: You expose your social graph to a global passive adversary because friends connect to friends directly. Your public IP is available in the DHT, allowing to track your physical locations. And your visible user name is exposed in the TLS certificate when somebody connects to your RetroShare node.

Several of these problems can be solved by disabling the built-in DHT and hiding RetroShare behind a Tor hidden service. People who scan Tor hidden services will however still be able to connect the service and see the RetroShare user name in the self-signed certificate. This can be prevented by setting up [[Hidden_Services#Hidden_Service_Authentication|Authenticated Hidden Services]] and limiting connections only to trusted people.

On November 4, 2014, RetroShare scored 6 out of 7 points on the Electronic Frontier Foundation's secure messaging scorecard. It lost a point because there has not been an independent code audit.<ref>https://www.eff.org/secure-messaging-scorecard</ref> A recent audit by the pen-testing group Elttam uncovered many bugs in the code (some remotely exploitable) that were promptly fixed. The auditor's opinion was that RetroShare's codebase lacked secure coding practice.<ref>https://www.elttam.com.au/blog/a-review-of-the-eff-secure-messaging-scorecard-pt1/</ref>

Running RetroShare through Tor enables you, to do things, which are normally potentially dangerous, such as adding random people (from a forum), while staying anonymous. (For example, to join a RetroShare forum.) This is '''not''' a recommendation, just stating a possibility. You can exchange your key on dedicated chat servers at: https://retroshare.rocks/

After adding tons of random "friends" from a public forum, connection to a very few people over TCP. <ref>Chance of working better ('''untested'''): [[Tunnel UDP over Tor]].</ref> <ref>Note, in case you are using the previous footnote, [[Security_Guide#Other_Anonymizing_Networks_over_Tor_UDP_Tunnel|Other Anonymizing Networks over Tor UDP Tunnel]] applies.</ref> Approximately only 5% were online. Although probably only a very small portion of the network could be seen, the content of the network looked pretty interesting.

There still may be some privacy caveats left with RetroShare trying to communicate outside of Tor, but that doesn't matter if Whonix makes any non-Tor traffic impossible.


== Installation and Setup ==

{{Third_Party_Repository}}



''RetroShare is currently available on Debian 7.0 Wheezy and 6.0 Squeeze for armel, armhf, i386 and amd64 architectures and for 8.0 Jessie.''


Before adding the repo<ref>http://retroshare.sourceforge.net/downloads.html</ref>, fetch the key and verify<ref>http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/AsamK:/RetroShare/Debian_8.0/Release.gpg</ref> fingerprints. Always check the fingerprint for yourself. The output at the moment is:

<pre>
pub  1024D/0x9418A47921691F91 2011-08-16 home:AsamK OBS Project <home:AsamK@build.opensuse.org>
      Key fingerprint = E2CE 3677 C801 5772 D097  B0AA 9418 A479 2169 1F91
</pre>

Download key with curl to home folder.

{{CodeSelect|code=
curl -o retroshare-pubkey.asc http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/AsamK:/RetroShare/Debian_8.0/Release.key
}}

Check fingerprints/owners without importing anything.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --with-fingerprint retroshare-pubkey.asc
}}

If it looks good import into trusted.gpg.d.<ref>To import asc key files into trusted.gpg.d they must be converted into a .gpg keychain file first.</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring ./retroshare-pubkey.gpg --import retroshare-pubkey.asc
sudo cp retroshare-pubkey.gpg /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/retroshare-pubkey.gpg
}}

For stable builds:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo su -c "echo -e 'deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/AsamK:/RetroShare/Debian_8.0/ /' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/retroshare06.list"
}}

For nightly builds:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo su -c "echo -e 'deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/AsamK:/RetroShare/Debian_8.0/ /' > /etc/apt/retroshare06-git.list"
}}


[[Update]] your package lists.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}

Install Retroshare.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install retroshare06
}}


For the latest nightly package name install <code>retroshare06-git</code> instead.

RetroShare setup:

** Pick a pseudonym and password. Don't use real name or location obviously. Move your mouse to generate enough entropy.

** Check ''Advanced Options'' -> ''Create a hidden node''

** Change key-length to 4096 bits for adequate security then generate the new profile.

== General ==
The concept of having a serverless and fully encrypted instant messenger based on Tor hidden services is marvelous.

Unfortunately, since time of writing (September 2015) TorChat can not be recommended. This is because the TorChat developer currently does not respond to other people, see [https://github.com/prof7bit/TorChat/issues TorChat issues]. Communication and support is crucial for anonymity related projects. TorChat is an unofficial project. Unaffiliated with The Tor Project.

== HowTo ==

=== Installation ===
'''EXPERIMENTAL'''<br />
Experimental in that it is difficult to install. Only use it in case you trust TorChat. There shouldn't be any anonymity leaks and it should be as safe as other hidden services in general and in Whonix.

Learn about [[Hidden Services]] in Whonix first and learn how to set up the hidden webserver. This will ease following this guide.

==== On Whonix-Gateway ====
===== Step 1: open /etc/tor/torrc =====
{{Open_/etc/tor/torrc}}

===== Step 2: edit /etc/tor/torrc =====
(all Whonix platforms)

Once inside {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}, scroll all the way to the bottom, and copy-paste the following text:

[[Qubes|Qubes-Whonix]]: 

{{IP-of-Qubes-Whonix-Workstation-AppVM}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/torchat/
HiddenServicePort 11009 IP-of-Qubes-Whonix-Workstation-AppVM:11009
}}

[[Non-Qubes-Whonix]]:

{{CodeSelect|code=
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/torchat/
HiddenServicePort 11009 10.152.152.11:11009
}}

(all Whonix platforms) 

Save.

===== Step 3: make changes to /etc/tor/torrc take effect =====
{{Reload Tor}}

===== Step 4: get your onion hostname =====
Find out your .onion hostname.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo cat /var/lib/tor/torchat/hostname
}}

===== Step 5: backup your Tor hidden service private key =====
{{
Backups_Tor_Hidden_Service_private_key
|private_key_file=/var/lib/tor/torchat/private_key
}}

==== On Whonix-Workstation ====
{{mbox
| type       = notice
| image      = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text       = No worries, this won't result in [[DoNot#Prevent_Tor_over_Tor_scenarios.|Tor over Tor]] thanks to Whonix's [[Dev/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor|anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor]] package on Whonix-Workstation which prevents this.
}}

===== Step 1: Install TorChat =====
Update your package lists.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}

Install TorChat.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install torchat python-socksipy
}}

===== Step 2: Configure TorChat =====
Open the {{Code2|torchat.ini}} which is in the hidden folder {{Code2|/home/user/.torchat/torchat.ini}}. The folder {{Code2|~/.torchat/Tor}} can be ignored.

{{CodeSelect|code=
kwrite /home/user/.torchat/torchat.ini
}}

Look for the following line.

<pre>
own_hostname = <your onion hostname without the .onion ending>
</pre>

Replace it with your onion hostname. For example if your onion hostname is {{Code2|idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion}} replace it enter {{Code2|idnxcnkne4qt76tg}}, so it looks like this:

<pre>
own_hostname = idnxcnkne4qt76tg
</pre>

Save.

===== Step 3: Qubers users only =====
{{
Qubes_Tor_Hidden_Service_Firewall_Exception
|port=11009
}}

===== Step 4: Final Notes =====
Done.

<u>Note</u>, that it may take up to 30 minutes (or so?) until a fresh .onion domain gets reachable.

=== Starting ===
{{mbox
| type       = notice
| image    = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text       = It can take a while until a Tor hidden service becomes reachable for the first time. Wait at least a few minutes before you believe it doesn't work.
}}

[[Qubes|Qubes-Whonix]]:<br />
Qubes App Launcher (blue/grey "Q") -> Whonix-Workstation AppVM (commonly named {{Code2|whonix}}) -> TorChat Instant Messenger

[[Non-Qubes-Whonix]]:<br />
Start menu -> Applications -> Internet -> TorChat Instant Messenger

=== Uninstall ===
If you want to remove it...

On Whonix-Workstation.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get remove torchat
}}

On Whonix-Gateway.

{{Open /etc/tor/torrc}}

And undo the changes in {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}} on Whonix-Gateway.

{{Reload Tor}}

=== Debugging ===

In case it won't work for you.

Test if Tor is reachable on 10.152.152.10:9119.

{{CodeSelect|code=
/usr/bin/wget.anondist-orig 10.152.152.10:9119
}}

If it says.

<pre>
--2013-02-13 13:49:47--  http://10.152.152.10:9119/
Connecting to 10.152.152.10:9119... connected.
HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 501 Tor is not an HTTP Proxy
2013-02-13 13:49:47 ERROR 501: Tor is not an HTTP Proxy.
</pre>

It means, it's fine and the port is reachable.

Run torchat in a Terminal.

{{CodeSelect|code=
torchat
}}

The following output is an example, how it looks when everything is fine.

<pre>
~ $ torchat
(0) [config,470,main] python version 2.7.3 (default, Jan  2 2013, 16:53:07) [GCC 4.7.2]
(0) [config,477,main] script directory is /usr/share/torchat
(0) [config,478,main] data directory is /home/user/.torchat
./tor.sh: 6: ./tor.sh: tor: not found
(0) [tc_client,2083,startPortableTor] very strange: portable tor started but hostname could not be read
(0) [tc_client,2084,startPortableTor] will use section [tor] and not [tor_portable]
</pre>

If you are using [[Multiple Whonix-Workstations]], where the Workstation has another IP than {{Code|10.152.152.11}} you must edit the following line in torchat.ini.

<pre>
listen_interface = 10.152.152.11
</pre>

Did the hidden webserver example from the [[Hidden Services]] page work for you? Try that first.

You also could try using the TorChat source package, which is still documented on the [[Deprecated]] page.

=== Technical Design ===

The [[Dev/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor]] package prevents Tor over Tor.
