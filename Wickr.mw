= Introduction =

Wickr Me can be installed in Debian and provides various functionality in addition to end-to-end encrypted messaging: <ref name=wickrme>https://snapcraft.io/wickrme</ref>

<blockquote>With Wickr Me, you can instantly connect with your friends 1:1 or in groups - now with fully encrypted voice calling, voice memos - new additions to the trusted end-to-end secure sharing of files, images, and videos. Take full control over who has access to your content and how long it remains accessible.</blockquote>

The application touts various privacy and security benefits, including: <ref name=wickrme />

* no access to messages or contact lists
* users' address books remain private and not stored on Wickr servers
* each message being encrypted with a new key
* no phone number or email address registration required
* nil storage of meta-data
* communication in private groups of up to 10 users
* partial open source code <ref>The encryption protocol <code>Wickr-Crypto-C</code> source code is available on [https://github.com/WickrInc/wickr-crypto-c GitHub].</ref>
* an expiration time can be set on messaging content
* incorporation of perfect forward and backward secrecy for user content

= Warning =

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text    = Wickr Me is considered a security risk and installation is discouraged as per [[Install Software|software installation best practices]]:
* <u>Unsigned software</u>: It is not possible to follow the security advice of always [[Verifying Software Signatures|verifying software signatures]], since installation is through <code>snap</code> which does not yet verify software signatures. <ref>For better security and stability, <code>wickr.com</code> could provide Debian downloads, or better yet an apt repository for Debian.</ref>
* <u>Installation procedure</u>: The third party package manager <code>snap</code> is required, which is generally discouraged. <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/snap-store-snaps-snapcraft-io-a-new-software-source/7631</ref>
* <u>[[Avoid_nonfreedom_software|Proprietary software]]</u>: Only the Wickr Me encryption protocol is open source. The rest of the client application source code and other elements remain proprietary and unavailable for public scrutiny. <ref>By comparison, the Signal protocol, client application and server are [https://github.com/signalapp fully open source].</ref>
}}

If proceeding despite the risk, it is recommended to use a [[Multiple_Whonix-Workstations|separate]] {{workstation_product_name}} for greater safety.

Efforts to persistently install Wickr Me in [[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]] via [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/bind-dirs/ bind-dirs] or with snap proxy settings have proven unsuccessful. This means it needs to be [[Install_Software#Install_Software_in_a_TemplateBasedVM|installed in a TemplateBasedVM]] on every occasion it is required.

Sorry, something just went wrong in Launchpad.

We’ve recorded what happened, and we’ll fix it as soon as possible. Apologies for the inconvenience.

Trying again in a couple of minutes might work.
