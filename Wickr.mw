=== Warnings ===
'''Security risk.''' Discouraged as per [[Install Software|software installation best practices]].

* Unsigned software. It is not possible to follow the security advice of always [[Verifying Software Signatures|verifying software signatures]] since installation is thorough <code>snap</code> which does not verify software signatures (yet?). <ref>For better security and stability Wickr.com would to provide Debian downloads or even better an apt repository for Debian.</ref>
* Only installable thorugh third party package manager <code>snap</code> which is discouraged. <ref>

</ref>
* Wickr is non-freedom software. '''Discouraged as per [[Avoid nonfreedom software|avoid non-freedom software]]!'''

Therefore if you insist on using wickr, it is recommended to use a [[Multiple_Whonix-Workstations|separate]] {{workstation_product_name}}.

=== Open Terminal ===
{{Open_a _product_ws_terminal}}

=== Dependencies ===
{{Update}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}

Install dependencies.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt install snapd
}}

=== Reboot ===
Reboot required. <ref>
So snap can add itself to the <code>PATH</code> environment variable.

Otherwise you could after installation start it from absolute path.

{{CodeSelect|code=
/snap/bin/wickrme
}}
</ref>

=== Install ===
{{CodeSelect|code=
snap install wickrme
}}

=== Done ===
The installation process is now complete.

== Start ==
{{CodeSelect|code=
wickrme
}}

== Troubleshooting ==
=== error: snap "wickrme" not found ===
As a workaround, try install any other snap package first.

{{CodeSelect|code=
snap install vlc
}}

Then try install wickrme again.

Sorry, something just went wrong in Launchpad.

We’ve recorded what happened, and we’ll fix it as soon as possible. Apologies for the inconvenience.

Trying again in a couple of minutes might work.

With Wickr still starting and showing an error during sign in that it could not connect to the Wickr Me Network (attempting to reconnect), it could be caused during the original installation of Wickr through "snap install wickrme". Try reinstalling Wickr with the "--devmode" flag enabled and it should fix the issue,

Removing Wickr.

{{CodeSelect|code=
snap remove wickrme
}}

The command needs to be run twice. The first run will disable the "wickrme" package, the second time will remove "wickrme".

{{CodeSelect|code=
snap remove wickrme
}}

To verify Wickr is no longer installed, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
snap list
}}

It should no longer show wickrme.

Reinstall using this command:

{{CodeSelect|code=
snap install --devmode wickrme
}}

Now try running

{{CodeSelect|code=
wickrme
}}
