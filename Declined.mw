Declined Feature Requests

This wiki chapter relates to feature requests that have been declined by developers. There are several reasons for a request to be declined; in general, an impartial assessment determines it is incompatible with either the current project priorities, goals and/or policies. The [[Reporting_Bugs#Community_Feedback|Community Feedback]] wiki entry provides additional context and factors influencing decision-making:
* the number of existing, competing priorities and challenges to realise ambitious roadmap goals
* an existing backlog of unresolved, unaddressed bugs and feature requests
* limited development (human) resources
* existing developer priorities
* the time-intensiveness or complexity of proposed feature requests

In simple terms, declined feature requests are not on the {{Whonix}} roadmap and are unlikely to be considered in the future. This also means any voluntary contributions would be refused and [[Professional Support]] is unavailable for possible implementation.

{{Whonix}} community members should not be discouraged if a feature suggestion is declined. The {{Whonix}} project will always remain highly receptive to genuine feedback and suggested improvements from users. For around a decade {{Whonix}} has prospered from community input and every suggestion will continue to be noted and carefully considered.
