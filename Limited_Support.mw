Limited support means that, {{project name}} developers are unlikely provide [[Support|free support]] for wiki pages which mention <code>limited support</code> and link to this wiki page. This is a bit different from [[unsupported]].

Please help us better support this feature by becoming a [[Contribute#Contributor|contributor]].

Consider [[Free Support Principle]].

It might be possible to get this feature implemented, documented, tested and/or supported by purchasing [[Professional Support]].

A lot documentation was contributed by the {{project name}} community. By the time of documentation addition submission it was audited to the best ability of {{project name}} developers for being non-malicious. In many cases even confirmed functionality. Or the documentation was added by {{project name}} developers by the time they where interested in these topics. Interests change over time.

A lot of such documentation is still useful for many users interested in these topics. Occasionally some things do not work for some users either due to user error, localized issues, transient (network) issues caused by third parties, updates by third parties, other or unknown causes.

Such documentation will not be deleted but instead its support status is or will be properly documented.

There user is free to ask in {{project name}} forums. Especially if there are related forum threads where the functionality in question was initially brought up by the {{project name}} community or contributor prior and/or after creation of the community documentation. There is a chance that the contributor or community will answer. However, {{project name}} developers should not be expected to replicate the functionality, re-test, troubleshoot any issues.

Reasons:

* Non-perfect documentation is sometimes enhanced or fixed the {{project name}} community.
* An analogy. A popular speaker on a conference had been approached by 500 people before the speech. Each individual requested a private discussion of just only 5 minutes. The speaker made a rough calculation. ~ 500 people multiplied by 5 minutes equals 2500 minutes. That is ~ 41 hours. That is more than one day worth of time. Therefore it's not feasible to speak with every individual for 5 minutes.
* Due to time restraints, {{project name}} developers cannot constantly re-test if combination of {{project name}} with third party software is still functional.
