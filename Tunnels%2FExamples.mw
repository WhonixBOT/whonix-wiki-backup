{{Tunnels_Introduction}}

= Introduction =

This page is intended to demonstrate how easy it is to add a VPN to {{project_name}}, whether utilizing a VPN tunnel-link before Tor (<code>User</code> &rarr; <code>Tor</code> &rarr; <code>VPN</code> &rarr; <code>Internet</code>) or after Tor (<code>User</code> &rarr; <code>VPN</code> &rarr; <code>Tor</code> &rarr; <code>Internet</code>).

The examples below are mainly for testing purposes. It is possible to set up accounts for the same reasons, or  the information can be used as a very rough guide for setting up a VPN with {{project_name}}. To remain anonymous: 

* In all cases, never enter personal information when signing up for an account. 
* Use an extra email address solely for registration purposes. 
* If planning on the <code>User</code> &rarr; <code>Tor</code> &rarr; <code>VPN</code> configuration, then you should obviously sign up through Tor. 
* If planning on the <code>User</code> &rarr; <code>VPN</code> &rarr; <code>Tor</code> configuration, it is unknown whether it is best to sign up via Tor or not, but it probably cannot hurt.

== Riseup.net Quick VPN Command Line Test ==

[https://riseup.net/ Riseup] is known to support TCP, UDP and [[SSL|TLS]].

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Create a [https://account.riseup.net/user/new new Riseup account].

Note an account can only be created with an [https://support.riseup.net/en/topics/10340-invite-code/posts invite code].

'''2.''' Obtain your VPN secret (VPN password).

The [https://riseup.net/ca/vpn/vpn-red/vpn-secret VPN secret] is a special password that is used instead of the regular password to access the [https://riseup.net/en/vpn Riseup VPN]:

* login to <code>account.riseup.net</code>
* click Passwords on the left sidebar
* click the Service Passwords tab

'''3.''' Download the Riseup CA certificate.

The "CA certificate" is used by the local program to confirm the identity of servers you connect to. Download it from [https://riseup.net/es/security/network-security/riseup-ca this page] or click this link: [https://riseup.net/es/security/network-security/riseup-ca/RiseupCA.pem RiseupCA.pem].

'''4.''' Open a terminal.

Navigate to the folder where <code>RiseupCA.pem</code> was saved.

'''5.''' Install [https://openvpn.net/ OpenVPN].

{{CodeSelect2|code=
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install openvpn
}}

'''6.''' Test the connection from the command line.

The following line from the Riseup OpenVPN for Linux page <ref>https://riseup.net/en/vpn/vpn-red/linux</ref> will not work for the connection: <code>user</code> &rarr; <code>Tor</code> &rarr; <code>VPN</code> &rarr; <code>Internet</code>, because the Tor network does not support UDP.

{{CodeSelect2|code=
sudo openvpn --client --dev tun --auth-user-pass --remote vpn.riseup.net 1194 --keysize 256 --auth SHA256 --cipher AES-256-CBC --ca RiseupCA.pem
}}

Instead, use the following functional command utilizing TCP for the connection: <code>user</code> &rarr; <code>Tor</code> &rarr; <code>VPN</code> &rarr; <code>Internet</code>.

{{CodeSelect2|code=
sudo openvpn --client --dev tun --auth-user-pass --remote vpn.riseup.net 1194 --keysize 256 --auth SHA256 --cipher AES-256-CBC --ca RiseupCA.pem --proto tcp
}}

'''7.''' For DNS, see [[#Riseup DNS|Riseup DNS]] below.
}}

== Riseup.net riseup.conf ==

Known to support TCP, UDP, SSL.<br />
(1) You need a riseup.net account.<br />
(2) You need to know your riseup account name.<br />
(3) Go to https://user.riseup.net/users/riseupusername/vpn to obtain your VPN secret. (VPN password) (Replace "riseupusername" with your actual riseup user name.) (Or just got to https://user.riseup.net, login and click on "VPN".)<br />
(4) Look inside the [https://help.riseup.net/vpn riseup VPN help page] for [https://help.riseup.net/en/riseup-ca <code>RiseupCA.pem</code>] and (right click) [https://help.riseup.net/en/security/network-security/riseup-ca/RiseupCA.pem download] it.<br />
(5) Create a file auth.txt inside the same folder.

<pre>
riseupusername
vpnsecret
</pre>
(6) Create a file riseup.conf inside the same folder.

<pre>
client
dev tun
auth-user-pass auth.txt
#remote vpn.riseup.net 443
#remote seattle.vpn.riseup.net 443
remote nyc.vpn.riseup.net 80
ca RiseupCA.pem
remote-cert-tls server
script-security 1
#user nobody
#group nobody
proto tcp
#log /var/log/openvpn.log
</pre>

(7) Start OpenVPN.

{{CodeSelect2|code=
sudo openvpn riseup.conf
}}

(8) For DNS, see [[#Riseup DNS]] below.

== Riseup DNS ==

=== Setup ===

{{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/resolv.conf
}}

Comment out.

<pre>
#nameserver 10.152.152.10
</pre>

Add.

<pre>
## Riseup.net OpenVPN DNS server
nameserver 172.27.100.1
</pre>

If you are not using riseup, you need to replace 172.27.100.1 and enter the virtual LAN IP address of your VPN providers DNS server. You might be able to obtain it from your VPN provider. You can also try to infer it after successfully connecting to the VPN from running "sudo route". The first destination default gateway should function as DNS server also.

Save.

If you want to be sure, that ''/etc/resolv.conf'' does not get overwritten by other packages. (Such as DHCP or resolvconf.)

{{CodeSelect2|code=
sudo chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf
}}

If you ever want to remove it, use ''-i''.

=== Testing ===

When using "''nameserver 10.152.152.10''"...

{{CodeSelect2|code=
nslookup idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion
}}

Will show.

<pre>
Server:         10.152.152.10
Address:        10.152.152.10#53
Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion
Address: 10.192.0.1
</pre>

When using "''nameserver 172.27.100.1''"...

{{CodeSelect2|code=
nslookup idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion
}}

Will show.

<pre>
Server:         172.27.100.1
Address:        172.27.100.1#53
** server can't find idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion: NXDOMAIN
</pre>

Because you can not access .onion domains when a VPN has be chained. (user &rarr; Tor &rarr; VPN &rarr; Internet)

Resolving clearnet DNS should work.

{{CodeSelect2|code=
nslookup riseup.net
}}

Should show.

<pre>
Server:         172.27.100.1
Address:        172.27.100.1#53
Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   riseup.net
Address: 198.252.153.35
</pre>

= usaip.eu =

<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">
For testing purposes, in past, [https://www.usaip.eu/ usaip.eu] was used. They have been chosen, because they were free and didn't block the tested outgoing UDP port. The free version of usaip.eu can probably only be used for testing purposes, as it is only a test version, which force disconnects every 7 minutes. For longer and serious/stable use, you'll probably need another, VPN account. If you would like to see more information anyway, please press on expand on the right.

'''Note, at time of writing, it looked like, that usaip is probably blocking SSL, therefore'''

{{CodeSelect2|code=
{{Curl Plain}} {{Curl Secure}} https://check.torproject.org

'''will probably not work.'''

Install OpenVPN.

{{CodeSelect2|code=
sudo apt-get install openvpn
}}

Go to [http://usaip.eu/en/index.php usaip.eu] and click on free demo. Download the ''usaip.zip''. It contains the OpenVPN configuration files. Unpack. Open a shell and get into the folder ''cd usaip''. List all files ''dir''. Connect to a VPN, for example:

{{CodeSelect2|code=
sudo openvpn /home/user/usaip/eu-luxemburg.ovpn
}}

At time of writing, the page stated, the password was ''demo'', password also ''demo''. Wait until it is connected. When success, it will show "Initialization Sequence Completed". It might happen, that the connection will not succeed for some unknown reason. In this case try replacing the eu-luxemburg.ovpn from the example above with another <country>.ovpn from the usaip folder.

DNS settings have not been considered for this usaip.eu chapter.

At time of writing the [https://www.riseup.net/en/openvpn-linux#kde riseup.net OpenVPN instructions for KDE] were not finished. Perhaps you'll find out yourself, use another guide for KDE Network Manager or use the command line based examples above.

Don't wonder if you don't see {{workstation_product_name}} (virtual) wired network interface to {{gateway_product_name}}. <ref>
That's still managed by the ordinary ifupdown way.

== GNOME Network Manager ==

<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">
You can usually integrate GNOME applications.
If you would like to see more information anyway, please press on expand on the right.
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
In case of GNOME Network Manager it just requires some more fiddling because upstream developers wanted to make GNOME and KDE as compatible as possible, which includes that one settings manager won't show up when the other desktop has been started in a dual (KDE, GNOME) installation.

If you want to install the GNOME Network Manager.

{{CodeSelect2|code=
sudo apt-get install network-manager-gnome network-manager-openvpn-gnome
}}

If you want to autostart GNOME Network Manager, open /etc/xdg/autostart/nm-applet.desktop with root rights.

{{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/xdg/autostart/nm-applet.desktop
}}

And comment out.

{{CodeSelect2|code=
NotShowIn=KDE;
}}

If you want to make the nm-applet start menu entries visible and to start it manually, open /usr/share/applications/nm-applet.desktop.

{{Open with root rights|filename=
/usr/share/applications/nm-applet.desktop
}}

And comment out.

{{CodeSelect2|code=
NotShowIn=KDE;
}}

And add.

{{CodeSelect2|code=
Categories=GNOME;GTK;Settings;X-GNOME-NetworkSettings;
}}

If you want to make the nm-connection-editor start menu entries visible and to start it manually, open nm-connection-editor.

{{Open with root rights|filename=
/usr/share/applications/nm-connection-editor.desktop
}}

And comment out.

{{CodeSelect2|code=
NotShowIn=KDE;
}}

Then you could open the settings.
