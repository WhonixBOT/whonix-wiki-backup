= Installation =
Recommended to be installed inside an offline VM (vault). <ref>
* In [[Qubes]], apt-get package installation could be done in TemplateVM.
* In [[Qubes]], download and verification could be done in a temporary TemplateBased AppVM, ideally [[Qubes/DisposableVM]]. Then move to offline vault VM.
* In [[{{non q project name short}}|{{non q project name}}]]: install first, then disconnect internet and never re-enable internet access. TODO document
</ref> When you want to keepassxc as replacement for Google Authenticator (actually TTOP, Time based One Time Password) [[2FA|Two Factor Authentication (2FA)]]) then a Debian based VM is more suitable than a {{workstation_product_name}} based VM. <ref>
Because accurate time required for TTOP and due to [[Boot Clock Randomization]] and [[sdwdate]] anonymizing time.
</ref>

Packages <code>yubikey-personalization yubikey-personalization-gui</code> are YubiKey related. Users not using YubiKey can skip installation of these packages and install <code>keepassxc</code> only.

First run question: either answer is ok.

Create a new database.

Default file name <code>Passwords.kdbx</code> is ok.

If you are using [[Full Disk Encryption]] you might want to use a very easy password. Up to you.

Left click one time on <code>root</code>

Then go to menu &rarr; entries &rarr; Add new entry &rarr; any name name as <code>test</code> &rarr; ok

right click on test &rarr; time based on time password &rarr; set up TOTP &rarr; Default &rarr; paste 2FA code &rarr; ok

= Time Fix =
[[2FA]] TTOP code changes every 30 seconds. So clock needs to be reasonable correct.

Troubleshoting only. If code does not match.

Set timezone to UTC for simplicity.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/Etc/UTC /etc/localtime
}}

Go to https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone/utc or any other similar source to find out the time in UTC.

Fix the click. Change the date and time accordingly!

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo date -s "26 SEPT 2018 11:54:25"
}}

Check if the clock is correct now.
