= Installation =
Recommended to be installed inside an offline VM (vault). <ref>
* In [[Qubes]], apt-get package installation could be done in TemplateVM.
* In [[Qubes]], download and verification could be done in a temporary TemplateBased AppVM, ideally [[Qubes/DisposableVM]]. Then move to offline vault VM.
* In [[{{non q project name short}}|{{non q project name}}]]: install first, then disconnect internet and never re-enable internet access. TODO document
</ref> When you want to keepassxc as replacement for Google Authenticator (actually TOTP, Time based One Time Password) [[2FA|Two Factor Authentication (2FA)]]) then a Debian based VM is more suitable than a {{workstation_product_name}} based VM. <ref>
Because accurate time required for TOTP and due to [[Boot Clock Randomization]] and [[sdwdate]] anonymizing time.
</ref>

Packages <code>yubikey-personalization yubikey-personalization-gui</code> are YubiKey related. Users not using YubiKey can skip installation of these packages and install <code>keepassxc</code> only.

= Autostart =
Optional. If you like to autostart keepassxc.

Create folder <code>~/.config/autostart/</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
mkdir -p  ~/.config/autostart/
}}

{{Open File|filename=
~/.config/autostart/keepassxc.desktop
}}

Paste the following content.

{{CodeSelect|code=
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=keepassxc
Exec=keepassxc
}}

Save.

The process is now complete.

= Usage =
'''1.''' Use of an offline VM (vault) is recommended.

'''2.''' Make sure clock is correct.

{{Workstation product name}} is unsuitable due to [[Boot Clock Randomization]] and [[sdwdate]] clock randomization. (Unless disabled and offline.)

'''3.''' To start.

{{CodeSelect|code=
keepassxc
}}

'''4.''' Create a new database.

'''5.''' Default file name <code>Passwords.kdbx</code> is ok.

If you are using [[Full Disk Encryption]] you might want to use a very easy password. Up to you.

'''6.''' Left click on <code>root</code>.

'''7.''' Menu &rarr; <code>Entries</code> &rarr; <code>Add new entry</code> &rarr; under <code>Title:</code> write any name name (such as <code>test</code>) &rarr; <code>OK</code>.

'''8.''' Right click on the new entry (such as <code>test</code>) &rarr; <code>Time-based one-time password</code> &rarr; <code>set up TOTP</code> &rarr; <code>Default RFC 6238 token settings</code> &rarr; paste 2FA code &rarr; <code>OK</code>.

'''9.''' Right click on the new entry (such as <code>test</code>) &rarr; <code>Time-based one-time password</code> &rarr; <code>show TOTP</code>.

= Time Fix =
* Non-Whonix 

[[2FA]] TOTP code changes every 30 seconds. So clock needs to be reasonable correct.

Troubleshoting only. If code does not match.

Set timezone to UTC for simplicity.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/Etc/UTC /etc/localtime
}}

Go to https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone/utc or any other similar source to find out the time in UTC.

Fix the clock. Change the date and time accordingly!

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo date -s "26 SEPT 2018 11:54:25"
}}

Check if the clock is correct now.

{{CodeSelect|code=
date
}}

* Whonix (Offline WorkStation)

Since whonix use sdwdate then there will be a delay in the 30 seconds, Meaning if the TOTP code showed up at 30 and you copy/paste it to the website or service which require the TOTP it wont work until the timer will reach to 8 seconds and below, This mean we have 22 seconds delay. (The result is tested in offline whonix-ws standaloneVM within Qubes OS)

If you want to fix this delay then disable sdwdate and bootclockrandomization by running this command: 

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo service sdwdate stop && sudo service bootclockrandomization stop
}}

= Getting the Browser Extension To Work =
{{Community Support}}

Install the browser addon from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keepassxc-browser/

(OPTIONAL) Install a more recent version of <code>keepassxc</code> (See https://backports.debian.org/Instructions/)

Create the following symlink to get the proxy to work:

{{CodeSelect|code=
cd ~/.tb/tor-browser/Browser/TorBrowser/Data/Browser/.mozilla
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
ln -s /home/user/.mozilla/native-messaging-hosts native-messaging-hosts
}}

Notes:
If the <code>.mozilla</code> folder does not exist, create it.
