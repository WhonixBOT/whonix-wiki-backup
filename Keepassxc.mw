= Installation =
Recommended to be installed inside an offline VM (vault). <ref>
* In [[Qubes]], apt-get package installation could be done in TemplateVM.
* In [[Qubes]], download and verification could be done in a temporary TemplateBased AppVM, ideally [[DispVM]]. Then move to offline vault VM.
* In [[Non-Qubes-Whonix]]: install first, then disconnect internet and never re-enable internet access. TODO document
</ref> When you want to keepassxc as replacement for Google Authenticator (actually TTOP, Time based One Time Password) [[2FA|Two Factor Authentication (2FA)]]) then Debian based VM is more suitable than a Whonix-Workstation based VM. <ref>
Because accurate time required for TTOP and due to [[Boot Clock Randomization]] and [[sdwdate]] anonymizing time.

Create a new database.

Default file name <code>Passwords.kdbx</code> is ok.

If you are using [[Full Disk Encryption]] you might want to use a very easy password. Up to you.

Left click one time on <code>root</code>

Then go to menu -> entries -> Add new entry -> any name name as <code>test</code> -> ok

right click on test -> time based on time password -> set up TOTP -> Default -> paste F2A code -> ok

right click on test again -> time based on time password -> show TOTP

= Time Fix =
[[2FA]] TTOP code changes every 30 seconds. So clock needs to be reasonable correct.

Troubleshoting only. If code does not match.

Set timezone to UTC for simplicity.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/Etc/UTC /etc/localtime
}}

Go to https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone/utc or any other similar source to find out the time in UTC.

Fix the click. Change the date and time accordingly!

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo date -s "26 SEPT 2018 11:54:25"
}}

Check if the clock is correct now.

{{CodeSelect|code=
