= Introduction =

[https://keepassxc.org/ KeePassXC] is: <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KeePassXC</ref>
<blockquote>...a free and open-source password manager. It started as a community fork of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KeePassX KeePassX] (itself a cross-platform fork of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KeePass KeePass]). ... The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation Electronic Frontier Foundation] mention KeePassXC as "an example of a password manager that is open-source and free." The tech collective PrivacyTools has included KeePassXC in their list of recommended password manager software because of its active development.</blockquote>

KeePassXC is recommended by the EFF in their [https://ssd.eff.org/en/ Surveillance Self-Defense] guide <ref>It is also recommended by [https://www.privacytools.io/ PrivacyTools], see [https://www.privacytools.io/software/passwords/ here] ([http://www.privacy2zbidut4m4jyj3ksdqidzkw3uoip2vhvhbvwxbqux5xy5obyd.onion/software/passwords/ v3])</ref> and it is considered a feature-rich, modern and fully cross-platform password manager; refer to the [https://keepassxc.org/project/ features list] and [https://keepassxc.org/docs/#faq-format FAQ] for more detail. The benefits of a password manager include: <ref>https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/creating-strong-passwords</ref>
* Strong and unique passwords can be created and stored by the one application.
* Responses to security questions can be safely stored. <ref>It is recommended to provide fictional information to security questions in order to limit personal disclosures. Honest answers might be discoverable by adversaries who then utilize it to bypass your passwords completely.</ref>
* All passwords can be protected by a single master password/passphrase.
* This methodology prevents the reuse of passwords across multiple services, which is a poor security practice.
* This provides better account protection, particularly when combined with [[Two-factor_authentication_2FA|Two-factor Authentication (2FA)]].

Note that KeePassXC does not automatically save changes when it is used, so this should be changed in the settings (otherwise unsaved password changes could be lost).

Reliable, open-source password managers are a useful tool but they also come with risks:
* Password managers create a single point of failure.
* Research suggests coding vulnerabilities are present in many password managers.
* Highly capable adversaries are likely to target password managers.
* Avoid storing passwords "in the cloud" (on remote servers) -- this is more convenient but introduces the risk of a cloud vulnerability leading to an exploit.
* Avoid crossing remote borders with electronic devices containing your password manager -- some jurisdictions can compel/demand password disclosure and the unlocking of devices. <ref>The US border is a case in point, see: [https://www.eff.org/wp/digital-privacy-us-border-2017 Digital Privacy at the U.S. Border: Protecting the Data On Your Devices].</ref> 

Before using a password manager like KeePassXC, conduct a risk assessment of your personal circumstances. If you are likely to be targeted, then consider creating [[Passwords|strong passwords]] manually instead and storing them in a safe physical location. One suitable method is EFF's [https://www.eff.org/dice Dice-Generated Passphrases] via their [https://www.eff.org/files/2016/07/18/eff_large_wordlist.txt long wordlist]. Note that passphrases should be at least [[Passwords#Diceware_Password_Strength|six words long]]; passphrases of 15 words or more will protect against future quantum computer advancements. <ref>Quantum computers halve the number of iterations required to brute-force a key. This means doubling the length of symmetric keys to protect against future (hypothetical) quantum attacks.</ref>

= Installation =

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' It is recommended to install <code>keepassxc</code> inside an offline (vault) VM.

* In [[Qubes]]: 
** <code>apt-get</code> package installation can be completed in the TemplateVM.
** Download and verification can also be performed in a temporary TemplateBased AppVM, ideally [[Qubes/DisposableVM|Qubes DisposableVM]]. Next move <code>keepassxc</code> to an offline vault VM.
* In [[{{non q project name short}}|{{non q project name}}]]: install <code>keepassxc</code> first, then disconnect the Internet and never re-enable internet access. TODO document

<u>Note</u>: If <code>keepassxc</code> will replace Google Authenticator (actually time-based, one-time password (TOTP), see: [[2FA|Two Factor Authentication (2FA)]]), then a Debian-based VM is more suitable than a {{workstation_product_name}} based VM. <ref>This is because accurate time is a precondition for TOTP -- {{project_name}} randomizes this value due to [[Boot Clock Randomization]] and [[sdwdate]].</ref>

'''2.''' Install <code>keepassxc</code>.

<u>Note</u>: The packages <code>yubikey-personalization</code> and <code>yubikey-personalization-gui</code> are YubiKey-related. If YubiKey is not in use, skip the installation of these packages and only install <code>keepassxc</code>.

{{Install_Package|package=
keepassxc yubikey-personalization yubikey-personalization-gui
}}

'''3.''' ''Optional:'' Install the browser plug-in for <code>keepassxc</code>.

It is possible to install the official KeePassXC browser plug-in for FireFox, see: [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keepassxc-browser/ KeePassXC-Browser]. <ref>This add-on is not actively monitored for security by Mozilla.</ref> If utilized, this allows KeePassXC to store passwords and auto-type them into various websites and applications.

<u>Note</u>: This configuration is unrecommended because any software vulnerabilities might unintentionally expose sensitive passwords.

= Autostart KeePassXC =

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = This is an optional configuration to autostart <code>keepassxc</code>.
}}

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Create folder <code>~/.config/autostart/</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
mkdir -p  ~/.config/autostart/
}}

'''2.''' Create a <code>keepassxc.desktop</code> file.

{{Open File|filename=
~/.config/autostart/keepassxc.desktop
}}

'''3.''' Paste the following content.

{{CodeSelect|code=
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=keepassxc
Exec=keepassxc
}}

'''4.''' Save the file.

The process is now complete.

= KeePassXC Usage =

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' It is recommended to use an offline (vault) VM.

'''2.''' Ensure the clock setting is correct.

{{Workstation product name}} is unsuitable due to [[Boot Clock Randomization]] and [[sdwdate]] clock randomization. (Unless disabled and offline.)

'''3.''' Launch <code>keepassxc</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
keepassxc
}}

'''4.''' Create a new database.

'''5.''' The default file name <code>Passwords.kdbx</code> is acceptable.

If [[Full Disk Encryption]] is already configured, a very simple password can be utilized; this is a personal choice.

'''6.''' Left click on <code>root</code>.

'''7.''' Add a new entry.

* Navigate to the Menu &rarr; <code>Entries</code> &rarr; <code>Add new entry</code> &rarr; under <code>Title:</code> write any name name (such as <code>test</code>) &rarr; <code>OK</code>.

'''8.''' Add a time-based, one-time password (TOTP).

* Right-click on the new entry (such as <code>test</code>) &rarr; <code>Time-based one-time password</code> &rarr; <code>set up TOTP</code> &rarr; <code>Default RFC 6238 token settings</code> &rarr; paste 2FA code &rarr; <code>OK</code>.

'''9.''' Reveal a TOTP code.

* Right-click on the new entry (such as <code>test</code>) &rarr; <code>Time-based one-time password</code> &rarr; <code>show TOTP</code>.
}}

= Troubleshooting: Time Fix =

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = These steps are for troubleshooting when TOTP codes do not match. [[2FA]] TOTP codes change every 30 seconds, therefore the clock needs to be reasonably accurate.
}}

== Non-Whonix ==

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Set the timezone to UTC for simplicity.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/Etc/UTC /etc/localtime
}}

'''2.''' Confirm the correct time in UTC.

Navigate to [https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone/utc <code>timeanddate.com</code>: UTC] or similar web resources to confirm the UTC time.

'''3.''' Fix the clock. 

In the example below, change the date and time accordingly.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo date -s "12 SEPT 2021 01:15:25"
}}

'''4.''' Confirm the clock is now correct.

{{CodeSelect|code=
date
}}
}}

== {{project_name}} Offline Workstation ==

Since {{project_name}} uses [[Sdwdate|Secure Distributed Web Date (<code>sdwdate</code>)]], there will be a delay in the TOTP 30-second period. For example, if <code>sdwdate</code> has enforced a 22 second delay, then a TOTP code copied and pasted into a website or service that requires it would not work until the timer reached eight seconds or below. (This result was tested in an offline <code>whonix-ws</code> standaloneVM in Qubes OS.)

To avoid delays, disable <code>sdwdate</code> and <code>bootclockrandomization</code> by running this command: 

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo service sdwdate stop && sudo service bootclockrandomization stop
}}

= Getting the Browser Extension To Work =
{{Community Support}}

Install the browser addon from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keepassxc-browser/

(OPTIONAL) Install a more recent version of <code>keepassxc</code> (See https://backports.debian.org/Instructions/)

Create the following symlink to get the proxy to work:

{{CodeSelect|code=
cd ~/.tb/tor-browser/Browser/TorBrowser/Data/Browser/.mozilla
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
ln -s /home/user/.mozilla/native-messaging-hosts native-messaging-hosts
}}

Notes:
If the <code>.mozilla</code> folder does not exist, create it.
