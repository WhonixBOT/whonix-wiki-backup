When a link to this wiki page is posted, it means that this question or issue is unspecific to {{project name}}. The advantage something being unspecific to {{project name}} is that it can possibly be resolved by utilizing different search terms or documentation, websites. More diverse options, information, opinions, expertise, alternative solutions, workarounds might be accessible.

It is likely possible that the user's web search options can be extended. Quote [[Free Support Principle]]:

<blockquote>In simple terms, {{project_name}} is based on: <ref>This is explained in more detail on the [[About]] page.</ref>

* A [[Supported_Platforms|supported platform]] ([https://www.debian.org/ Debian]).
* Two software packages produced by [https://www.torproject.org The Tor Project (TPO)] - [https://www.torproject.org Tor] and [[Tor Browser]].
* A host of other software packages.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is impossible for the [[Contributors|{{project_name}} contributors]] to be aware of the solution to each and every problem that is encountered. Users are therefore encouraged to first consider if their problem is general, and unspecific to {{project_name}}.</blockquote>

Rephrasing the question, removing the {{project name}} specific part of it, utilizing other resources might yield more information.

It might also be the case that this question is unlikely to be answered in {{project name}} [[Support]] channels due to [[Community_Support#Developer_Constraints|Developer Constraints]].
