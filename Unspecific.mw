When a link to this wiki page is posted, it means the question or issue raised is unspecific to {{project name}}. The upside is it can possibly be resolved by utilizing different search terms, documentation or various websites. Reasonable search efforts are likely to yield more diverse options, information, opinions, expertise, alternative solutions, and possible workarounds.

In other words, it is highly likely that issues or questions can be solved by extending web search options. Quote [[Free Support Principle]]:

<blockquote>In simple terms, {{project_name}} is based on: <ref>This is explained in more detail on the [[About]] page.</ref>

* A [[Download|supported platform]] ([https://www.debian.org/ Debian]).
* Two software packages produced by [https://www.torproject.org The Tor Project (TPO)] - [https://www.torproject.org Tor] and [[Tor Browser]].
* A host of other software packages.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is impossible for the [[Contributors|{{project_name}} contributors]] to be aware of the solution to each and every problem that is encountered. Users are therefore encouraged to first consider if their problem is general, and unspecific to {{project_name}}.</blockquote>

Rephrasing the question, removing the {{project name}}-specific component, or utilizing other resources might result in more information. Further, sometimes questions are unlikely to be answered in {{project name}} [[Support]] channels due to [[Community_Support#Developer_Constraints|Developer Constraints]].
