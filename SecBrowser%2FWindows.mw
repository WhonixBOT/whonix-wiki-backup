# Source Tor Browser
# Install Tor Browser
# Disable Tor
# Start Tor Browser
# Normalize SecBrowser ™ Behavior

= Source Tor Browser =

== Download Tor Browser Installer for Windows ==
{{Box|text=
The Tor Browser Installer for Windows package will be downloaded and used to install Tor Browser. 

'''1.''' Browse to https://www.torproject.org/download/

'''2.''' Download Tor Browser installer for Windows: <code>Left "click" Windows icon</code> &rarr; <code>"click" Save file</code>.
}}

== Install Tor Browser  ==
{{Box|text=
Tor Browser installation is a simple process with Tor Browser Installer for Windows.

'''1.''' Choose the Tor Browser installation Path and language.

Navigate to the folder where <code>torbrowser-install-win64-9.0.1_en-US</code> was downloaded:
* <code>Double "click" torbrowser-install-win64-9.0.1_en-US</code> &rarr; <code>Select language</code> &rarr; <code>"click" OK</code> &rarr; <code>Choose Install Location</code> &rarr; <code>"click" OK</code> &rarr; <code>Choose Install Location</code> &rarr; <code>"click" Install</code>.

'''2.''' Complete Tor Browser setup.

Once Tor Browser has been installed, a popup window will ask if a Start Menu and Desktop Shortcut should be added and if Tor Browser should be started once complete. Check ☑ both boxes and "click" Finish. 

'''Figure:''' ''Tor Browser Installation Complete''

[[Image:complete_TorBrowser_setup.png]]

'''3.''' Set network connections.

When Tor Browser starts for the first time it asks for "Tor Network Settings" to be set. Click <code>Connect</code>, then wait while the connection to Tor is completed. When Tor has successfully connected, Tor Browser will open and the necessary steps to configure SecBrowser ™ outlined below can be completed.

| text    = 
Disabling Tor means traffic will not be routed through the Tor network. Similar to other browsers, your IP address will be visible to any network observers or the recipients of any communications. '''This configuration is not anonymous.'''
}}

== Disable Tor ==

{{Box|text=

'''<u>Tested Platforms</u>'''

''Windows 10''

'''1.''' Disable Tor Launcher extension.

Create a new text file in the folder where Tor Browser was extracted. For example, the file could have the following name: <code>Start TB without Tor.bat</code> Add the following text. <ref>It is necessary to set the <code>SET TOR_SKIP_LAUNCH=1</code> environment variable, then start Tor Browser. The Tor Browser Launcher add-on will detect this, skip the connection wizard and skip launching Tor.</ref> <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/disable-tor-in-torbrowser-9/8336</ref>

<pre>
SET TOR_SKIP_LAUNCH=1
SET TOR_TRANSPROXY=1
“Start Tor Browser.lnk”
</pre>

Save the file and exit.

'''2.''' Disable <code>socks</code> network <code>DNS</code>.

In the Tor Browser address bar type; <code>about:config</code> and press "Enter".

Next, in the search bar type; <code>network.proxy.socks_remote_dns</code> and press "Enter".

Then right click <code>true  and <i>Toggle</i> to false</code>.

'''Figure:''' ''about:config Warning''

'''Figure:''' ''Disable Tor Browser Socks Proxy DNS''

[[Image:disable_Tor_socks_proxy_dns.png]]

'''3.''' Close Tor Browser.
}}

== Start Tor Browser ==

Tor Browser can be started by launching the <code>Start TB without Tor.bat</code> batch file.

If configured correctly Tor Browser will have a red background with a message stating '''"Something Went Wrong!"''' Tor is not working in this browser.

= Normalizing SecBrowser ™ Behavior =

== Usability vs. Security ==

While SecBrowser ™ has numerous security enhancements they can come at a cost of decreased usability. Since it is also highly configurable, security settings and behavior can be customized according to personal requirements. This is commonly referred to as an usability vs. security trade-off. 

Tor Browser behavior can be modified by creating a <code>user.js</code> file in the Tor Browser default.profile folder. Users can then add custom settings to meet usability requirements.

-----

'''Security Slider'''

SecBrowser ™ has a “Security Slider” in the shield menu. This can increase security by disabling certain web features that pose possible attack vectors. By default, the Tor Browser Security Slider is set to “Standard” which is the lowest security level. Conversely the SecBrowser ™ security level is set to "Safest" which will prevent some web pages from functioning properly, so security needs must be weighed against the degree of usability that is required. Users can adjust the security slider as needed to meet usability / security requirements.

-----

'''Private Browsing Mode'''

In the default configuration Tor Browser has private browsing mode enabled. This setting prevents browsing and download history as well as cookies from remaining persistent across SecBrowser ™ restarts. However, private browsing mode can be disabled by setting <code>browser.privatebrowsing.autostart</code> to "false".

When private browsing mode is disabled, SecBrowser ™'s built-in "long-term linkability" protections are deactivated. This means users are vulnerable to attacks which can link activities between earlier and later browsing sessions. If privacy is paramount users can enable private browsing mode by commenting out the corresponding user preference. 

-----

'''Persistent NoScript Settings'''

NoScript settings can be set to persist across browser restarts by setting <code>extensions.torbutton.noscript_persist</code> to "true". This is a security vs usability trade-off. If the SecBrowser ™ “Security Slider” setting is changed afterwards, all NoScript preferences are overridden and all custom, per-site settings are lost. This holds true regardless of whether the security setting was increased or decreased. 

-----

'''Remember Logins and Passwords for Sites'''

By default, Tor Browser does not save site login information such as user names or passwords. To save login information users can set <code>signon.rememberSignons</code> to "true", which allows user names and passwords to be saved across browser sessions.

-----

'''Anti-tracking Extensions'''

If a user disables some of Tor Browser's own anti-tracking features (like private browsing mode; see above), then it is logical to install one or more extensions that make it harder to track later browsing. The extensions [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/disconnect/ Disconnect], [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger17/ Privacy Badger] <ref>The browser might need to be restarted for it to work.</ref> and [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/ uBlock Origin] are all open-source and are generally recommended. Research which one(s) are most suitable in your circumstances; their use cases are different.

== Modify Settings ==
{{Box|text=

'''1.''' To change the above settings, create a <code>user.js</code> file in the Tor Browser default.profile folder.

In the start menu, run,

{{CodeSelect|code=
notepad
}}

Add the following text to modify all of the above settings or cherry pick those which meet your requirements. <ref>

Once settings have been added <code>"click" File</code> &rarr; <code>Save As...</code>
<br></br>
Next, save the <code>user.js</code> file by first navigating to the default Tor Browser profile folder. A desktop starter was added during Tor Browser configuration which is where the PATH/to/default/TorBorwser/profile/ begins:

* <code>"Click" Desktop</code> &rarr; <code>Tor Browser</code> &rarr; <code>Browser</code> &rarr; <code>TorBrowser</code> &rarr; <code>Data</code> &rarr; <code>Browser</code> &rarr; <code>profile.default</code> &rarr; <code>"Add" <i>Filename:</i> user.js</code> &rarr; <code><i>Save as type:</i> All Files</code> &rarr; <code>"click" Save</code>.
