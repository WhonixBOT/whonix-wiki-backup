Questions:

* Type? (VPN, proxy, ssh?)
* Usable with Open Source Software, without any proprietary client? (OpenVPN etc.)
* Is there a Linux version?
* Does it work in WINE?
* Can Whonix (Tor) get tunneled through it? (Whonix (Tor) can get tunneled thought a VPN running on the host and also supports all kinds of proxy settings (http(s), socks4(a)/5).)
* Instructions?
