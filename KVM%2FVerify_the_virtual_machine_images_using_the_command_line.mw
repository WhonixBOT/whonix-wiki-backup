{{gpg_verification_introduction}}

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Import the signing key.

Refer the the more secure, detailed [[KVM/Whonix Signing Key|{{project name}} KVM Signing Key]] instructions.

{{Code2|<u>'''{{#widget:Key_HulaHoop}}'''</u>}}

'''2.''' Download the cryptographic (OpenPGP) signature corresponding to the virtual machine image you want to verify.

'''3.''' Save the signature in the same folder as the virtual machine image.

* https://download.whonix.org/libvirt/{{Version_KVM}}/Whonix-XFCE-{{Version_KVM}}.libvirt.xz
* https://download.whonix.org/libvirt/{{Version_KVM}}/Whonix-XFCE-{{Version_KVM}}.libvirt.xz.asc

'''4.''' Start the cryptographic verification.

This process can take several minutes.

{{CodeSelect|code=
cd [the directory in which you downloaded the .ova and the .asc]
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --verify-options show-notations --verify Whonix*.libvirt.xz.asc Whonix*.libvirt.xz
}}

'''5.''' Check the output of the verification step.

<u>If the virtual machine image is correct</u>, the output will inform that the signature is good:

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg: Good signature from "HulaHoop"
}}

This output might be followed by a warning as follows.

{{Template:GnuPG-Warning}}

{{gpg_signature_timestamp}}

The first line includes the signature creation timestamp; see the example below.

<pre>
gpg: Signature made Mon 19 Jan 2015 11:45:41 PM CET using RSA key ID 77BB3C48
</pre>

{{GnuPG_file_names}}

{{gpg_file_name_notation}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg: Signature notation: file@name={{project_name_short}}-{{Version_KVM}}.libvirt.xz
}}

<u>If the Virtual Machine image is not correct</u>, the output will inform that the signature is bad:

<pre>
gpg: BAD signature from "HulaHoop"
</pre>
