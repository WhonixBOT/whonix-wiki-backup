= Introduction =

SecBrowser ™ is a security-focused browser that provides better protection from exploits, thereby reducing the risk of infection from malicious, arbitrary code. A built-in security slider provides enhanced usability, as website features which increase the attack surface (like JavaScript) can be easily disabled. Since many of the features that are commonly exploited in browsers are disabled by default, SecBrowser ™'s attack surface is greatly reduced. Without any customization, SecBrowser ™’s default configuration offers better security than Firefox, Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.<ref name=design>https://2019.www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/</ref> It also provides better protections from [[Data_Collection_Techniques|online tracking]], [[Data_Collection_Techniques#Fingerprinting_of_Browser_.28HTTP.29_Header|fingerprinting]] and the linkability of activities across different websites.

SecBrowser ™ is a derivative of the Tor Browser Bundle (which itself is a derivative of Mozilla Firefox) but without Tor. This means unlike Tor Browser, SecBrowser ™ does <i>not</i> route traffic over the Tor network, which in common parlance is referred to as "clearnet" traffic. Even without the aid of the Tor network, SecBrowser ™ still benefits from the numerous [https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor-browser.git patches] that Tor developers have merged into the code base. Even with developer skills, these enhancements would be arduous and time-consuming to duplicate in other browsers, with the outcome unlikely to match SecBrowser ™'s many security benefits. While browser extensions can be installed to mitigate specific attack vectors, this ad hoc approach is insufficient. SecBrowser ™ leverages the experience and knowledge of skilled Tor Project developers, and the battle-tested Tor Browser.
