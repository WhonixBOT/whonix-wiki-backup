See [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/tree/master/release Release Folder] in Whonix source code.

Clean source code

* get rid of .directory files inside the source code: dolphin -> preferences -> general -> behavior -> use common view properties for all folders
* get rid of ~backup files: find ./ -name '*~' | xargs trash-put

Other important stuff

* Don't forget to update Whonix version number.
* <s>write proper debian/changelog with debchange</s>
* git add --force debian/changelog (?)
* [[LeakTests]]!
* [[Test]] the images before final release! (Testers-only releases can be uploaded straight away.)
* See if [[Documentation]] still makes sense.
* Update the [[Dev/Changelog]] from git changelog (task of coders, not release manager).
* See https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/release/whonix_release
* Search the wiki for [[Template:Stable]] and [[Template:Testing]] and act accordingly. (How to search them is still an open question.) (Can also be done by coders, not release manager.)




* Upload the images.
* At least a few testers should test final releases before posting a news. Testers may be found by posting a news.
* Check, if [[Manually Updating Tor Browser]] is still up to date. (If not, fixing is task of coders, not release manager.)
* Update [[Download]].


* Only next version: Update gpg verification instructions. (Change from .sig to .asc.)
* Only next version: chmod -x / +x no longer required for [[Browser Plugins]] and [[Dev/Flash Tutorial]].
* Only next version: [[whonixcheck]]
* Only next version: [[XChat]]
* Only next version: chmod -x / +x update [[Tunnel_Proxy_or_SSH_or_VPN_through_Tor]]
* Only next version: point sf important blog to https://anonymousoperatingsystem.wordpress.com/category/important/feed/ and sf feature blog to https://anonymousoperatingsystem.wordpress.com/feed/ (set up as internal feed in https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/admin/tools)
* Only next version: update [[Stream Isolation]] chmod -x / +x no longer recommended, use /etc/whonix.d instead.
* Update [[Physical Isolation]].
* Update links on the [[Build Documentation]] page.
* Update [[Features]].
* Update [http://sourceforge.net/projects/whonix/ sf.net project page].


* Update [[Template:Version]].
* Check version number on [[Main Page]] and check if it still makes sense.
* Incorporate new documentation which has been prepared on the page: [[Next]].


* Finally announce: Post a news. (Not nagging external lists. Common sense. Mostly final releases.)
