See [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/tree/master/release Release Folder] in Whonix source code.

== Pre Building ==
Clean source code

* get rid of .directory files inside the source code: dolphin -> preferences -> general -> behavior -> use common view properties for all folders
* get rid of ~backup files: find ./ -name '*~' | xargs trash-put


* update download readme
* add your own {{Code|default-key}} to your own /home/user/.gnupg/gpg.conf


* <s>write proper debian/changelog with debchange</s>
* git add --force debian/changelog (?)


* push the source code to github

<pre>
git push origin master
</pre>

* Create an OpenPGP signed git tag. This will also be used as Whonix version number.

<pre>
git tag -s version
</pre>

* Push the OpenPGP signed git tag to github.

<pre>
git push origin version
</pre>

== Post Building ==
* OpenPGP sign the images.

<pre>
./release/sign_images
</pre>

* Upload the images. (sf.net shell fingerprint: {{Code|80:1c:ee:50:14:cd:ef:28:3e:82:c6:ef:44:55:d7:74}})

<pre>
./release/upload_images
</pre>

* At least a few testers should test final releases before posting a news. Testers may be found by posting a news.
* Check, if [[Manually Updating Tor Browser]] is still up to date. (If not, fixing is task of coders, not release manager.)
* Update [[Download]].
* See if [[Documentation]] still makes sense.
* Update the [[Dev/Changelog]] from git changelog (task of coders, not release manager).
* Search the wiki for [[Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Stable]] and [[Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Testing]] and act accordingly. (Can also be done by coders, not release manager.)

* [[LeakTests]]!
* [[Test]] the images before final release! (Testers-only releases can be uploaded straight away.)
