|description=Design Documentation about Redistribution of Whonix
}}

== Introduction ==
Developers only!

These are notes for producing official [[Download|downloadable]] binary Whonix images.

== Pre Building ==
'''Only required if you want to redistribute (official) Whonix builds.'''

Clean source code

* <ref>
get rid of .directory files inside the source code:
<pre>
dolphin -> preferences -> general -> behavior -> use common view properties for all folders
</pre>
</ref>
* <ref>
get rid of ~backup files:
<pre>
find ./ -name '*~' | xargs trash-put
</pre>
</ref>
* You can get a list of unwanted files with {{Code|git clean -dfxn}} and remove them with {{Code|git clean -dfx}}.


* Update [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/tree/master/build_sources frozen repository sources.list files] by using a newer snapshot.debian.org repository.


* Update Whonix debian package repository.


* update download readme
* add your own {{Code|default-key}} to your own {{Code|/home/user/.gnupg/gpg.conf}}

* Check that all packages point to signed git commits. (Optional.)

<pre>
packages/whonix-developer-meta-files/debug-steps/packaging-helper-script pkg_verify_signed_commit
</pre>

* Git tag sign all packages. (Needs some testing.) (Optional.)

<pre>
packages/whonix-developer-meta-files/debug-steps/packaging-helper-script pkg_git_sign_and_push_tags
</pre>

* Check that all packages point to a signed git commit and signed git tag.

<pre>
packages/whonix-developer-meta-files/debug-steps/packaging-helper-script pkg_verify_signed_commit_and_tag
</pre>

* push the source code to github

<pre>
git push origin master
</pre>

* Check, that the current git commit is a signed.

<pre>
## You might wish using a git or bash alias to safe typing.
git log --show-signature HEAD^..HEAD
</pre>

Or use the generic makefile as a shortcut.

<pre>
make git-commit-verify
</pre>

* Create an OpenPGP signed git tag. This will also be used as Whonix version number.

<pre>
git tag -s version
</pre>

* Make sure the current git head is a signed git commit and signed git tag.

To simplify this, you could use the generic makefile.

<pre>
make git-verify
</pre>

* Push the OpenPGP signed git tag to github.

<pre>
git push origin version
</pre>

* Remember to build both ova images as well as qcow2 images by using these build script command line arguments.

<pre>
--target qcow2 --target virtualbox
</pre>

== Post Building ==
'''Only required if you want to redistribute (official) Whonix builds.'''

* [[Dev/APT Repository]]

* OpenPGP sign the images.

<pre>
packages/whonix-developer-meta-files/whonix_build --gnw -- ./release/prepare_release --target qcow2 --target virtualbox --build
</pre>

* Upload the images.

<pre>
packages/whonix-developer-meta-files/release/upload_images
</pre>

* Update [[Download#Whonix_Version_Check_and_Whonix_News|{{Code|Whonix News Files}}]].
* OpenPGP sign, verify, transfer {{Code|Whonix News Files}}.

<pre>
packages/whonix-developer-meta-files/release/upload_whonix_news_v4
</pre>

=== Testing ===

* At least a few testers should test final releases before posting a news. Testers may be found by posting a news.
* [[LeakTests]]!
* [[Test]] the images before final release! (Testers-only releases can be uploaded straight away.)

=== Wiki Page Updates ===
Only next time:
* Copy [[Whonixcheck#SSL_Certificate_Pinning|whonixcheck TPO SSL certificate pinning instructions]] to [[Advanced_Security_Guide]].


* Check, if [[Manually Updating Tor Browser]] is still up to date. (If not, fixing is task of coders, not release manager.)
* Update [[Download#Download_Whonix|Download Table]].
* See if the download table works in a fresh browser. (Check for caching issues.)
* Update [[Known Issues]].
* See if [[Documentation]] still makes sense.
* Search the wiki for [[Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Stable]] and [[Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Testing]] and act accordingly. (Can also be done by coders, not release manager.)
* Update [[Dev/Build Documentation/Physical Isolation]].
* Update links on the [[Dev/Build Documentation]] page.
* Update [[Features]].
* Update [http://sourceforge.net/projects/whonix/ sf.net project page].
* Update default download on [http://sourceforge.net/projects/whonix/ sf.net project page].
* Update [[Template:Version]] (or [[Template:VersionNew]]).
* Check version number on [[Main Page]] and check if it still makes sense.
* Incorporate new documentation which has been prepared on the page: [[Next]].
