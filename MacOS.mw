If you still need help, please check the [[Support|Support]] page.

After the Whonix .ova files are imported they can be removed. VirtualBox will make a new directory with the live virtual machines Whonix-Gateway.vbox and Whonix-Workstation.vbox contained in directories named the same. By default this is '/Users/(yourusername)/VirtualBox VMs'.

'''Miscellaneous macOS advice'''
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
*If you plan on using the same VMs on multiple systems (e.g Boot Camp or even two different physical machines) you can move them to a shared or external hard drive. First copy the VirtualBox VMs folder mentioned above to the new location. Next, select the VMs you moved and then click remove. When prompted select "Delete files". Finally, re-add the VMs from their new location by selecting Machine=>Add and navigating to the new folder. ExFAT is the easiest format for cross platform file sharing with Windows and Linux. ExFAT is an option built into Apple's "Disk Utility.app" when initializing or reformatting a storage device. Select ExFAT from the drop down menu that appears when you click "Erase". The default option is HFS+ on 10.13 "High Sierra" and earlier and APFS on 10.14 "Mojave".

*With its POSIX kernel and BSD roots, many issues that arise on macOS hosts can be addressed with a strategy similar to other Unix-like OS.

'''Virtualization on non-Apple hardware'''
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
*Virtualization on osx86 aka "Hackintosh" machines with unmodified "vanilla" kernels works well but some additional BIOS/UEFI settings need to be confirmed to ensure system stability. As of November 2018 Intel VT-d is not recommended although your system may function if enabled. Later BIOS revisions from American Megatrends Inc. (AMI) seem to improve support versus earlier releases. AMD-Vi is not supported since kernel modifications violating Apple Inc. EULA are required to run macOS on platforms other than Intel. It is also recommended to disable IGPU if PCIe graphics are being used and to disable any SuperIO/Serial Port options if listed in BIOS.  Please consult the appropriate community forums and wikis available on the internet if you encounter virtualization problems related to unsupported architectures or features.
