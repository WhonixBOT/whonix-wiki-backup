= General Advice =
With its POSIX kernel and BSD roots, many issues that arise on macOS hosts can be addressed with a strategy similar to other Unix-like OS.

= Non-Apple Hardware =
Virtualization on osx86 aka "Hackintosh" machines with unmodified "vanilla" kernels works well but some additional BIOS/UEFI settings need to be confirmed to ensure system stability. As of November 2018 Intel VT-d is not recommended although your system may function if enabled. Later BIOS revisions for GIGABYTE and ASUS seem to improve support versus earlier releases. AMD-Vi is not supported since kernel modifications violating Apple Inc. EULA are required to run macOS on platforms other than Intel. It is also recommended to disable IGPU if PCIe graphics are being used and to disable any SuperIO/Serial Port options if listed in BIOS.  Please consult the appropriate community forums and wikis available on the internet if you encounter virtualization problems related to unsupported architectures or features.

= Known Bugs =
Please help improve the wiki and edit this page to add bugs encountered on macOS
