After the {{project name}} .ova files are imported they can be removed. VirtualBox will make a new directory with the live virtual machines {{gateway_product_name_short}}.vbox and {{workstation_product_name_short}}.vbox, and they are contained in directories of the same name. By default this is ''/Users/(yourusername)/VirtualBox VMs''

'''Miscellaneous macOS Advice'''
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
If the same VMs will be used on multiple systems like Boot Camp or even two different physical machines, then they can be moved to a shared or external hard drive:

# Copy the VirtualBox VMs folder mentioned earlier to the new location. 
# Select the VMs you moved and then click remove.
# When prompted, select "Delete files". 
# Re-add the VMs from their new location by selecting <code>Machine=>Add</code>, then navigating to the new folder.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExFAT exFAT] is the easiest format for cross platform file sharing with Windows and Linux. exFAT is an option built into Apple's "Disk Utility.app" when initializing or reformatting a storage device. Select exFAT from the drop down menu that appears when you click "Erase". The default option is HFS+ on 10.13 "High Sierra" and earlier and APFS on 10.14 "Mojave".

Note that with its [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX POSIX] kernel and BSD roots, many issues that arise on macOS hosts can be addressed using strategies similar to other Unix-like OSes.

'''Virtualization on non-Apple Hardware'''
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
Virtualization on osx86 aka "Hackintosh" machines with unmodified "vanilla" kernels works well, but some additional BIOS/UEFI settings need to be confirmed to ensure system stability. As of November 2018 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT-d Intel VT-d] is not recommended, although some systems may function if it is enabled. Later BIOS revisions from American Megatrends Inc. (AMI) seem to have improved support compared to earlier releases. 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD-V#I/O_MMU_virtualization_(AMD-Vi_and_Intel_VT-d) AMD-Vi] is not supported, since kernel modifications violating Apple Inc.'s End User License Agreement (EULA) are required to run macOS on platforms other than Intel. It is also recommended to disable the Integrated Graphics Processing Unit (IGPU) if [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express PCIe graphics] are in use, as well as disabling any SuperIO/Serial Port options if listed in BIOS. If virtualization problems related to unsupported architectures or features are encountered, please first consult appropriate community forums and wikis available on the Internet.
