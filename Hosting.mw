There are many so called offshore or anonymous hosting companies. Most of those hosting companies do not really offer anonymity. Most require valid registration data (real name etc.), forbid registration over Tor and/or do not offer anonymous payment methods.

<s>The ones listed in the following list are Tor user friendly, accept anonymous registration and can be payed anonymously by BTC or prepaid cards.
