|description=List of Third Party Hosting Services that allow content to be hosted anonymously
}}

= Introduction =

You can either host your own anonymous services (web sites etc.) at home, at servers you physically own or you can use (free) services (free .onion web space, VPS servers, web space, etc.) provided by third parties.

For hosting your own services at home or at servers you physically own, see [[Hidden Services]].

This page is about Third Party Hosting Services. You can also host [[Hidden Services]] on some Third Party Hosting Services.

= Third Party Hosting Services =

There are many so called offshore or anonymous hosting companies. Most of those hosting companies do not really offer anonymity. Most require valid registration data (real name etc.), forbid registration over Tor and/or do not offer anonymous payment methods.

<s>The ones listed in the following list are Tor user friendly, accept anonymous registration and can be payed anonymously by BTC or prepaid cards.

If you like to be added to this list or have improvements or corrections, please get in [[Contact]].</s> ([https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,1273.0.html List deprecated.])
