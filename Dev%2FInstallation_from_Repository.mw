Also known as proverbial "{{Code2|sudo apt-get install whonix}}".

It has been suggested to install Whonix from APT repository. Either from a local APT repository or from [[Whonix-APT-Repository|Whonix's official APT repository]].

Would this be technically feasible? Probably yes, but it is not tested by any [[Authorship#Current_Maintainers|Whonix maintainers]] and probably needs some work.

There is a [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-meta-packages/blob/master/debian/control#L339 whonix-gateway] as well as a [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-meta-packages/blob/master/debian/control#L369 whonix-workstation] meta package. So we are not far from "{{Code2|sudo apt-get install whonix-gateway}}" and "{{Code2|sudo apt-get install whonix-workstation.}}".

While most packages can be probably installed just fine, an open question is how to handle [[Dev/Source_Code_Intro#Chroot_Scripts|chroot scripts]], that would not be applied during such an installation method.

There are no instructions yet on how to do that using Whonix's APT repository. But the repository is already up and running (use Whonix's {{Code2|wheezy}} repository and creating instructions for importing the key, adding to apt sources and installing wouldn't be hard to create.

Or if you want to install from source code, info and scripts for automation (package building, creating a local repository, installation) are mostly available <ref>[[Dev/Build_Documentation/8_deb]]</ref> <ref>https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/build-steps.d/1200_create-debian-packages</ref> <ref>https://github.com/Whonix/whonix-developer-meta-files/blob/master/debug-steps/locally-upgrade-whonix-debian-packages</ref>.

So in summary, what's missing?

* instructions
* Thinking through how to handle [[Dev/Source_Code_Intro#Chroot_Scripts|chroot scripts]].
* a maintainer
* testing
