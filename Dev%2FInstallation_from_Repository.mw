An installation of Debian can be transformed into {{project name}} or {{kicksecure}}. Also known as proverbial "{{Code2|sudo apt-get install whonix}}". This is also called <code>distro-morphing</code>. <ref>
Is this technically feasible? Yes. This is how [[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]] is build.

[[Dev/Source_Code_Intro#Chroot_Scripts|chroot scripts]] are negligible since {{project name}} 13.

The following meta packages:

* <code>non-qubes-whonix-gateway-cli</code>
* <code>non-qubes-whonix-gateway-xfce</code>
* <code>non-qubes-whonix-workstation-cli</code>
* <code>non-qubes-whonix-workstation-xfce</code>
* <code>kicksecure-cli</code>
* <code>kicksecure-cli-vm</code>
* <code>kicksecure-xfce</code>
* <code>kicksecure-xfce-vm</code>

can be installed on Debian as per instructions [[{{project name short}} Packages for Debian Hosts|{{project name}} Packages for Debian Hosts]].

This is [[unsupported]], not tested by any [[Contributors|{{project_name}} contributors]] and might need some work. What's missing?

* instructions
* a [[Contribute#Contributor|contributor]]

= From Source Code =
Above instructions use packages from {{project name}} binary repository. Transforming Debian to {{project name}} or {{kicksecure}} is also possible from a local APT repository, i.e. without touching {{project name}} binary repository. If you want to install from source code, info and scripts for automation (package building, creating a local repository, installation) are available <ref>

= Distro Morphing vs Builds =
What is the difference between a build (downloaded or build from source code) versus distro morphing installation method?

* It is quite similar as it should be.

Advantages of builds:

* have tighter control over the packages getting installed. Using Debian installer is kinda like a "wonder box" what packages get installed. Difficult to predict what packages will be installed without skills to understand Debian installer. Distro morphing one can see what packages will be installed by studying mostly 1 file + dependency packages.
* more likely to get the same tested build that developers and users received.
* more likely to really get the distribution. Distro morphing might fail due to user error and not get noticed by novice users.
