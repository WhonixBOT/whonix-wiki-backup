Either from a local APT repository or from [[{{project name short}}-APT-Repository|{{project name}} official APT repository]].

Is this technically feasible? Yes. This is how [[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]] is build. For [[{{non q project name short}}|{{non q project name}}]] this is [[unsupported]], not tested by any [[Authorship#Current_Maintainers|{{project_name}} maintainers]] and might need some work.

<ref>([[Dev/Source_Code_Intro#Chroot_Scripts|chroot scripts]] are negligible since {{project name}} 13.)</ref>

[https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/whonix-developer-meta-files/blob/master/README_generic.md#how-to-install-in-debian-using-apt-get There are some instructions on how to do that using {{project name}} APT repository.]

Or if you want to install from source code, info and scripts for automation (package building, creating a local repository, installation) are mostly available. <ref>[[Dev/Build_Documentation/8_deb]]</ref> <ref>https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/{{project_name_short}}/blob/master/build-steps.d/1200_create-debian-packages</ref> <ref>https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/whonix-developer-meta-files/blob/master/debug-steps/locally-upgrade-whonix-debian-packages</ref>

So in summary, what's missing?
