An installation of Debian can be transformed into {{project name}} or {{kicksecure}}. Also known as proverbial "{{Code2|sudo apt-get install whonix}}". This is also called <code>distro-morphing</code>. <ref>
Is this technically feasible? Yes. This is how [[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]] is build.

[[Dev/Source_Code_Intro#Chroot_Scripts|chroot scripts]] are negligible since {{project name}} 13.

The following meta packages:

* <code>non-qubes-whonix-gateway-cli</code>
* <code>non-qubes-whonix-gateway-xfce</code>
* <code>non-qubes-whonix-workstation-cli</code>
* <code>non-qubes-whonix-workstation-xfce</code>
* <code>kicksecure-cli</code>
* <code>kicksecure-cli-vm</code>
* <code>kicksecure-xfce</code>
* <code>kicksecure-xfce-vm</code>

can be installed on Debian as per instructions [[{{project name short}} Packages for Debian Hosts|{{project name}} Packages for Debian Hosts]].

This is [[unsupported]], not tested by any [[Contributors|{{project_name}} contributors]] and might need some work. What's missing?

= From Source Code =
Above instructions use packages from {{project name}} binary repository. Transforming Debian to {{project name}} or {{kicksecure}} is also possible from a local APT repository, i.e. without touching {{project name}} binary repository. If you want to install from source code, info and scripts for automation (package building, creating a local repository, installation) are available <ref>
