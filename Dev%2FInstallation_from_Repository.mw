Also known as proverbial "{{Code2|sudo apt-get install whonix}}".

It has been suggested to install Whonix from APT repository. Either from a local APT repository or from [[Whonix-APT-Repository|Whonix's official APT repository]].

Is this technically feasible? Yes. This is how [[Qubes-Whonix]] is build. For [[Non-Qubes-Whonix]] this is [[unsupported]], not tested by any [[Authorship#Current_Maintainers|Whonix maintainers]] and probably needs some work.

There is a non-qubes-whonix-gateway as well as a non-qubes-whonix-workstation meta package. So we are close to "{{Code2|sudo apt-get install non-qubes-whonix-gateway}}" and "{{Code2|sudo apt-get install non-qubes-whonix-workstation.}}".

([[Dev/Source_Code_Intro#Chroot_Scripts|chroot scripts]] are negligible since Whonix 13.)

[https://github.com/Whonix/whonix-developer-meta-files/blob/master/README_generic.md#how-to-install-in-debian-using-apt-get There are some instructions on how to do that using Whonix's APT repository.]

Or if you want to install from source code, info and scripts for automation (package building, creating a local repository, installation) are mostly available. <ref>[[Dev/Build_Documentation/8_deb]]</ref> <ref>https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/build-steps.d/1200_create-debian-packages</ref> <ref>https://github.com/Whonix/whonix-developer-meta-files/blob/master/debug-steps/locally-upgrade-whonix-debian-packages</ref>

So in summary, what's missing?

* instructions
* a [[Contribute#Maintainer|maintainer]]
* testing
