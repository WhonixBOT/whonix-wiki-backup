= If Whonix had a DHCP server running on eth1 on Whonix-Gateway... =

Advantages:

* setting up [[Multiple Whonix-Workstations]] would be simpler
* using [[Other Operating Systems]] would be simpler

Disadvantages:

* Higher attack surface due to DHCP?

Needs research:

* Does DHCP have some feature which a compromised Whonix-Workstation could abuse? Does DHCP have a feature such as "tell me the IP of your upstream router"?

= If Whonix has a DHCP client running on eth0 on Whonix-Workstation... =

Disadvantages:

* Needs research: Some users with little knowledge only download Whonix-Workstation and set its network settings to DHCP. ([[Special:AWCforum/st/id240/#post_1143|example]]) Accepting any IP from DHCP would allow them to non-anonymously use Whonix-Workstation easily. We would have to add some protection not accepting an IP from Virtual Box NAT, if that is possible.
* Needs research: Configuration of [[Hidden Services]] could become more difficult, because these need a fixed internal IP?
