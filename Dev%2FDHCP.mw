= If {{project name}} had a DHCP server running on eth1 on {{gateway_product_name}}... =

Advantages:

* setting up [[Multiple Whonix-Workstations]] would be simpler
* using [[Other Operating Systems]] would be simpler

Disadvantages:

* Higher attack surface due to DHCP?

Needs research:

* Does DHCP have some feature which a compromised {{workstation_product_name}} could abuse? Does DHCP have a feature such as "tell me the IP of your upstream router"?

= If {{project name}} had a DHCP client running on eth0 on Whonix-Workstation... =

Disadvantages:

* Needs research: Some users with little knowledge only download {{workstation_product_name}} and set its network settings to DHCP. ([[Special:AWCforum/st/id240/#post_1143|example]]) Accepting any IP from DHCP would allow them to non-anonymously use {{workstation_product_name}} easily. We would have to add some protection not accepting an IP from VirtualBox NAT, if that is possible.
* Needs research: Configuration of [[Onion Services]] could become more difficult, because these need a fixed internal IP?
