The Tor software does not yet support UDP, <ref>https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7830</ref> although Tor provides a DnsPort.

If UDP is urgently required in {{project_name}}, a limited workaround is provided - see the [[#VPN_Method|VPN Method]] below.
}}

= VPN Method =

This tutorial uses OpenVPN and works well inside {{project_name}}. Additional VPN implementations like PPTP might be useful -- as well as other VPN protocols which are free and support UDP -- but further research is required.

Before setting up the VPN:

* Refer to related VPN documentation: [[Tunnels/Connecting to Tor before a VPN|How to connect to Tor before a VPN (User &rarr; Tor &rarr; VPN &rarr; Internet)]].
* Familiarize yourself with curl and rdate. The rdate command line switch <code>-p</code> results in just showing the date and time, without setting it. <code>-u</code> uses UDP instead of TCP (the default).

'''1.''' Test the {{project_name}} setup is generally working. <ref>While enforcing SSL.</ref> <ref>Alternatively the test can be run without enforcing SSL because some VPN services appear to block it.

{{CodeSelect|code=
{{Curl_Plain}} http://check.torproject.org
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
{{Curl_Plain}} {{Curl Secure}} https://check.torproject.org
}}

This should output "Congratulations. Your browser is configured to use Tor."

'''2.''' Install rdate for UDP and TCP testing.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get update
}}
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install rdate
}}

'''3.''' Run commands for TCP testing.

{{CodeSelect|code=
rdate -p time.u.washington.edu
}}
{{CodeSelect|code=
rdate -p time.nist.gov
}}
{{CodeSelect|code=
rdate -p ptbtime1.ptb.de
}}

'''4.''' Run commands for UDP testing.

{{CodeSelect|code=
rdate -u -p time.u.washington.edu
}}
{{CodeSelect|code=
rdate -u -p time.nist.gov
}}
{{CodeSelect|code=
rdate -u -p ptbtime1.ptb.de
}}

The tests should reveal that without a VPN, TCP works over Tor, but not UDP.

'''5.''' Configure a VPN tunnel link in {{project_name}}.

Obviously a VPN provider that does not block UDP is required. Follow the setup instructions on the [[TestVPN|VPN Tunnel Setup Examples]] page; the [[TestVPN#Riseup.net|riseup]] and [[TestVPN#usaip.eu|usaip]] examples are functional for this purpose.

Afterwards test rdate again, first in TCP mode and then in UDP mode -- both should work correctly.

= SSH Method =

This method is currently [[undocumented]]. In theory, SSH servers could be utilized to tunnel UDP over Tor. Obstacles:

* Free SSH services are rarely available.
* The existing free SSH services block certain ports, which makes this even harder.
* Even though SSH can provide a SOCKS5 proxy, it is not capable of providing [http://zarb.org/~gc/html/udp-in-ssh-tunneling.html tunneling support for UDP itself].
** Extra software needs to be installed on both the client and (even worse) the server with root access. Most administrators of free SSH services will not allow this configuration.
* Acquiring a server [[Money|comes with its own challenges]].

Therefore this method is only useful if you have your own server, but even then the VPN method is usually preferable.

= SOCKS5 Proxy Method =

Attempts to tunnel UDP with this configuration have failed.
