|description=Instructions for installing VirtualBox Guest Additions in Whonix. Shared Folders, Mouse Integration, etc.
}}

== Installing VirtualBox Guest Additions ==
=== Installed by Default ===
Beginning from Whonix 10 and above, VirtualBox Guest Additions are already installed by default.

For technical information:<br />
See blog post, [https://www.whonix.org/blog/installing-virtualbox-guest-addition-by-default Installing VirtualBox Guest Addition by Default?]

=== Instructions for Debian Jessie ===
<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed" style="width:800px">
Whonix 9/10 is based on Debian Wheezy. So unless you are using a Whonix-Custom-Workstation based on Debian Jessie, you most likely want to use above instructions. Otherwise press expand on the right side.
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
'''Not sure if the jessie instructions are still up to date. Maybe the ones for wheezy also work for jessie just fine.

Inside your VirtualBox virtual machine.

This version is difficult to get working with guest additions and vbox shares. Debian Jessie has the issue that Whonix installs with Kernel 3.10 and the distro is at 3.12, and the 3.10 headers are not available. Therefore, it is dangerous (and unsafe) to get the Kernel headers on a different repository. Additionally, there are reports that updating the kernel can cause issues (and is also unsafe).

NoteÀê It has been reported that reverting Virtualbox 2 versions back with 3.10 can also solve issues. Update this wiki with your results.

=== Old instructions for Ubuntu Precise ===
Moved to [[Ubuntu]].

== Clipboard Sharing ==
Clipboard sharing is disabled by default in the VirtualBox VM for Whonix-Workstation for {{Code2|security reasons}}<ref>
To prevent accidentally copying something (non-)anonymous and pasting it in its (non-)anonymous counter part (browser etc.), which would lead to identity correlation.
</ref>. For Whonix-Gateway, one directional clipboard sharing from host to Whonix-Gateway is enabled and {{Code2|secure}}<ref>
https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,986
</ref>.

Enable it only temporarily in case you really need it. How? Power off the virtual machine.<ref name=poweroff>Because otherwise you cannot change VirtualBox VM settings.</ref> Go to {{Code2|VirtualBox machine settings -> General -> Advanced -> Shared Clipboard -> Bidirectional -> ok}}. Power on the virtual machine again.

== Shared Folder ==
=== Mount Shared Folder ===
Power off the virtual machine.<ref name=poweroff /> Go to {{Code2|VirtualBox -> Machine -> Settings -> Shared Folder -> choose a folder -> use folder name '''shared'''}}. Choose {{Code2|mount automatically}} and {{Code2|create permanently}}. Press {{Code2|OK}}.

If you are using a Whonix-Custom-Workstation, you need to run two extra commands. Please click on expand on the right. Otherwise you can skip this. <ref>
The steps.

<pre>
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/shared
sudo chmod 777 /mnt/shared

have already been applied by the [https://github.com/Whonix/shared-folder-help shared-folder-help] package for your convenience.

<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
<pre>
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/shared
sudo chmod 777 /mnt/shared
</pre>
</div>
</div>

Inside the virtual machine, use the following commands to mount the folder.

<pre>
sudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=1000 shared /mnt/shared
</pre>

If you run into a '''Protocol Error''' try using a different name, do not use ''share'', use something else, anything, for example, '''shared'''. 

=== Permanently Mount Shared Folder ===
Please read [[#Mount Shared Folder]] instructions above first.

After reboot, you have to repeat the mount command. If you want to mount the folder automatically, have a look at the [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VirtualBox/SharedFolders source] of that information or simply add '''before''' ''exit 0'' in your {{Code2|/etc/rc.local}}:

<pre>
sudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=1000 shared /mnt/shared
</pre>

== Warning ==
'''Warning: Not recommended?'''

* Weakens security in general as per [[Security_Guide#VirtualBox_Hardening|VirtualBox Hardening]]?
* <s>See article, [http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=OTk5Mw The VirtualBox Kernel Driver Is Tainted Crap] <ref>http://www.webcitation.org/6HqJVN0br</ref></s> <font size="-3"><-- Was a misconception. It's talking about the kernel driven (on the host), not guest additions.</font>
* Opposite statements: [http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/08/msg00112.html one] / [http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/08/msg00116.html two]

== Alternatives ==
* For file exchange with Whonix without installing guest additions, see [[File Transfer]].
* To get a higher screen resolution without installing guest additions, see [[Higher Screen Resolution]]
* To get mouse integration without installing guest additions, use USB tablet in VirtualBox settings. Recommended against, because it requires adding USB controller to VirtualBox. (VirtualBox -> Right click on Virtual Machine -> Settings -> System -> Enable absolute pointing device)

== Temporary disable Guest Additions ==
'''This solution is incomplete!''' In case you want to temporarily disable VirtualBox guest additions, you can try this. A safer solution would be to uninstall them.

Find out which VirtualBox kernel modules are load.

<pre>cat /proc/modules | grep vbox</pre>

Create a new config file for module blacklisting.

<pre>sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/vbox.conf</pre>

And add:

<pre>
blacklist vboxvideo
blacklist vboxsf
blacklist vboxguest
</pre>

Safe and reboot. Done.
