== Clipboard Sharing ==
Clipboard sharing is disabled by default in the VirtualBox VM for Whonix-Workstation for {{Code2|security reasons}}<ref>
To prevent accidentally copying something (non-)anonymous and pasting it in its (non-)anonymous counter part (browser etc.), which would lead to identity correlation.
</ref>. For Whonix-Gateway, one directional clipboard sharing from host to Whonix-Gateway is enabled and {{Code2|secure}}<ref>
https://www.whonix.org/old-forum/index.php/topic,986
</ref>.

Enable it only temporarily in case you really need it. How? Power off the virtual machine.<ref name=poweroff>Because otherwise you cannot change VirtualBox VM settings.</ref> Go to {{Code2|VirtualBox machine settings -> General -> Advanced -> Shared Clipboard -> Bidirectional -> ok}}. Power on the virtual machine again.

== Shared Folder ==

<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
Power off the virtual machine.<ref name=poweroff /> Go to {{Code2|VirtualBox -> Machine -> Settings -> Shared Folder -> choose a folder ->   folder name '''shared'''}}. Choose {{Code2|mount automatically}}. Press {{Code2|OK}}. <ref>
For your convenience, the [https://github.com/Whonix/shared-folder-help shared-folder-help] package applied the following steps for you already.

a) [https://github.com/Whonix/shared-folder-help/blob/master/debian/shared-folder-help.postinst shared-folder-help.postinst]  did:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/shared
}}
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo chmod 777 /mnt/shared
}}
 
b) Mounting of the shared folder is done by the [https://github.com/Whonix/shared-folder-help/blob/master/lib/systemd/system/mnt-shared-vbox.service mnt-shared-vbox] systemd service.

If you are using a Whonix-Custom-Workstation, please click on expand on the right.
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
Power off the virtual machine.<ref name=poweroff /> Go to {{Code2|VirtualBox -> Machine -> Settings -> Shared Folder -> choose a folder ->   folder name '''shared'''}}. Choose {{Code2|mount automatically}}. Press {{Code2|OK}}.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/shared
}}
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo chmod 777 /mnt/shared
}}

Inside the virtual machine, use the following commands to mount the folder.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=1000 shared /mnt/shared
}}

If you run into a '''Protocol Error''' try using a different name, do not use ''share'', use something else, anything, for example, '''shared'''. 

After reboot, you have to repeat the mount command. If you want to mount the folder automatically,  add '''before''' ''exit 0'' in your {{Code2|/etc/rc.local}}:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=1000 shared /mnt/shared
}}

== Security ==
The article [http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=OTk5Mw The VirtualBox Kernel Driver Is Tainted Crap] <ref>http://www.webcitation.org/6HqJVN0br</ref> is talking about the kernel driven (on the host), not guest additions. Opposite statements: [http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/08/msg00112.html one] / [http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/08/msg00116.html two].

== Installed by Default ==
Beginning from Whonix 10 and above, VirtualBox Guest Additions are already installed by default. (Package [https://packages.debian.org/jessie/virtualbox-guest-x11 virtualbox-guest-x11] from Debian's apt repository.)

<font size=-3>
For technical information:<br />
See blog post, [https://www.whonix.org/blog/installing-virtualbox-guest-addition-by-default Installing VirtualBox Guest Addition by Default?]
</font>

== Old instructions for Ubuntu Precise ==
Moved to [[Ubuntu]].

== Installation from VirtualBox CD ==
Discouraged until [https://phabricator.whonix.org/T378 make vbox-disable-timesync compatible with guest additions from virtualbox CD] gets implemented.

== Alternatives ==
* For file exchange with Whonix without installing guest additions, see [[File Transfer]].
* To get a higher screen resolution without installing guest additions, see [[VirtualBox/Higher Screen Resolution without installing VirtualBox Guest Additions]]
* To get mouse integration without installing guest additions, use USB tablet in VirtualBox settings. Recommended against, because it requires adding USB controller to VirtualBox. (VirtualBox -> Right click on Virtual Machine -> Settings -> System -> Enable absolute pointing device)

== Temporary disable Guest Additions ==
'''This solution is incomplete!''' In case you want to temporarily disable VirtualBox guest additions, you can try this. A safer solution would be to uninstall them.

Find out which VirtualBox kernel modules are load.

{{CodeSelect|code=
cat /proc/modules | grep vbox
}}

Create a new config file for module blacklisting.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/vbox.conf
}}

And add:

{{CodeSelect|code=
blacklist vboxvideo
blacklist vboxsf
blacklist vboxguest
}}

Safe and reboot. Done.
