}}

== Installing VirtualBox Guest Additions ==
=== Installed by Default ===
Beginning from Whonix 10 and above, VirtualBox Guest Additions are already installed by default. (Package [https://packages.debian.org/jessie/virtualbox-guest-x11 virtualbox-guest-x11] from Debian's apt repository.)

<font size=-3>
For technical information:<br />
See blog post, [https://www.whonix.org/blog/installing-virtualbox-guest-addition-by-default Installing VirtualBox Guest Addition by Default?]
</font>

=== Old instructions for Ubuntu Precise ===
Moved to [[Ubuntu]].

=== Installation from VirtualBox CD ===
Discouraged until [https://phabricator.whonix.org/T378 make vbox-disable-timesync compatible with guest additions from virtualbox CD] gets implemented.

== Clipboard Sharing ==
Clipboard sharing is disabled by default in the VirtualBox VM for Whonix-Workstation for {{Code2|security reasons}}<ref>
To prevent accidentally copying something (non-)anonymous and pasting it in its (non-)anonymous counter part (browser etc.), which would lead to identity correlation.
</ref>. For Whonix-Gateway, one directional clipboard sharing from host to Whonix-Gateway is enabled and {{Code2|secure}}<ref>
https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,986
</ref>.

Enable it only temporarily in case you really need it. How? Power off the virtual machine.<ref name=poweroff>Because otherwise you cannot change VirtualBox VM settings.</ref> Go to {{Code2|VirtualBox machine settings -> General -> Advanced -> Shared Clipboard -> Bidirectional -> ok}}. Power on the virtual machine again.

== Shared Folder ==
=== Mount Shared Folder ===
Power off the virtual machine.<ref name=poweroff /> Go to {{Code2|VirtualBox -> Machine -> Settings -> Shared Folder -> choose a folder -> use folder name '''shared'''}}. Choose {{Code2|mount automatically}} and {{Code2|create permanently}}. Press {{Code2|OK}}.

If you are using a Whonix-Custom-Workstation, you need to run two extra commands. Please click on expand on the right. Otherwise you can skip this. <ref>
The steps.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/shared
}}
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo chmod 777 /mnt/shared
}}

have already been applied by the [https://github.com/Whonix/shared-folder-help shared-folder-help] package for your convenience.

<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/shared
}}
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo chmod 777 /mnt/shared
}}
</div>
</div>

Inside the virtual machine, use the following commands to mount the folder.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=1000 shared /mnt/shared
}}

If you run into a '''Protocol Error''' try using a different name, do not use ''share'', use something else, anything, for example, '''shared'''. 

=== Permanently Mount Shared Folder ===
Please read [[#Mount Shared Folder]] instructions above first.

After reboot, you have to repeat the mount command. If you want to mount the folder automatically, have a look at the [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VirtualBox/SharedFolders source] of that information or simply add '''before''' ''exit 0'' in your {{Code2|/etc/rc.local}}:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=1000 shared /mnt/shared
}}

== Warning ==
'''Warning: Not recommended?'''

* Weakens security in general as per [[Security_Guide#VirtualBox_Hardening|VirtualBox Hardening]]?
* <s>See article, [http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=OTk5Mw The VirtualBox Kernel Driver Is Tainted Crap] <ref>http://www.webcitation.org/6HqJVN0br</ref></s> <font size="-3"><-- Was a misconception. It's talking about the kernel driven (on the host), not guest additions.</font>
* Opposite statements: [http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/08/msg00112.html one] / [http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/08/msg00116.html two]

== Alternatives ==
* For file exchange with Whonix without installing guest additions, see [[File Transfer]].
* To get a higher screen resolution without installing guest additions, see [[Higher Screen Resolution]]
* To get mouse integration without installing guest additions, use USB tablet in VirtualBox settings. Recommended against, because it requires adding USB controller to VirtualBox. (VirtualBox -> Right click on Virtual Machine -> Settings -> System -> Enable absolute pointing device)

== Temporary disable Guest Additions ==
'''This solution is incomplete!''' In case you want to temporarily disable VirtualBox guest additions, you can try this. A safer solution would be to uninstall them.

Find out which VirtualBox kernel modules are load.

{{CodeSelect|code=
cat /proc/modules | grep vbox
}}

Create a new config file for module blacklisting.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/vbox.conf
}}

And add:

<pre>
blacklist vboxvideo
blacklist vboxsf
blacklist vboxguest
</pre>

Safe and reboot. Done.
