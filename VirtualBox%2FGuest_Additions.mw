* Clipboard sharing is disabled by default in the Virtual Box VM settings for Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation. Enable it only temporarily in case you really need it. Go to VirtualBox machine settings -> General -> Advanced -> Shared Clipboard -> Disable -> ok.


* <s>Additionally they give the Virtual Machine access to the host's (built-in) microphone. Many notebooks have a built-in microphone. In case you install Guest Additions anyway, better cover it up or remove your microphone.

== Installing VirtualBox Guest Additions ==
=== New Instructions for Debian Wheezy ===
Very simple.

Searching<ref>http://packages.debian.org/search?searchon=names&keywords=virtualbox</ref> for Debian packages containing VirtualBox was a wise thing. In past it was sometimes a real pain to install the guest additions. The search brought up, that honorable people created a debian package with the tools. Simply do:

<pre>sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade</pre>

Followed by.

<pre>
## If you only want Shared Folder, for improved security,
## you can try using only the next line, but not the line after next.
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends virtualbox-guest-dkms virtualbox-guest-utils

## If you want all features, such as dynamic resolution
## and mouse integration.
sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-x11
</pre>

Reboot. And you're done.

Alternatively, if this fails, you could also refer to the upstream documentation, [https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html VirtualBox: Chapter 4. Guest Additions].

NOTE: Sometimes after reboot the Workstation guest fails to pick up a new resolution. Try to change the screen resolution manually a few times, from KDE settings. Once it succeeds to change to fullscreen, the change will stay persistent across reboots.

=== Old instructions for Ubuntu Precise ===
Moved to [[Ubuntu]].

== Shared Folder ==
As an alternative to Shared Folders provided by VirtualBox Guest Additions, you could also have a look at the [[File Transfer]] page for alternatives.

And if you want to use the shared folder read ahead... Go to VirtualBox -> machine -> change -> shared folder -> choose a folder -> use folder name '''shared'''. Choose mount automatically and create permanently. Press ok. Use the following commands to mount to folder.

<pre>
#sudo mkdir -p /mnt/shared
#sudo chmod 777 /mnt/shared
sudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=1000 shared /mnt/shared
</pre>

If you run into a '''Protocol Error''' try using a different name, do not use ''share'', use something else, anything, for example, '''shared'''. 

=== Permanently mount Shared Folder ===

After reboot, you have to repeat the mount command. If you want to mount the folder automatically, have a look at the [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VirtualBox/SharedFolders source] of that information or simply add '''before''' ''exit 0'' in your /etc/rc.local:

<pre>
sudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=1000 shared /mnt/shared
</pre>

<ref>
The steps.

<pre>
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/shared
sudo chmod 777 /mnt/shared
</pre>

have already been applied by {{Code|/usr/share/whonix/postinst.d/70_shared_folder}} for your convenience.
</ref>

== Temporary disable Guest Additions ==
'''This solution is incomplete!''' In case you want to temporarily disable VirtualBox guest additions, you can try this. A safer solution would be to uninstall them.

Find out which VirtualBox kernel modules are load.

<pre>cat /proc/modules | grep vbox</pre>

Create a new config file for module blacklisting.

<pre>sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/vbox.conf</pre>

And add:

<pre>
blacklist vboxvideo
blacklist vboxsf
blacklist vboxguest
</pre>

Safe and reboot. Done.
