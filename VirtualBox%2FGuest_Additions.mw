= Introduction = 
With respect to clipboard sharing:

* Bidirectional clipboard sharing is currently enabled by default in {{project_name}} VirtualBox VMs. <ref>[https://forums.whonix.org/t/host-whonix-gateway-clipboard-sharing-enable-by-default/894 Host -> Whonix-Gateway clipboard sharing enable by default?]</ref> There are security reasons to disable clipboard sharing, for example to prevent the accidental copying of something (non-)anonymous and pasting it in its (non-)anonymous counterpart such as a browser, which would lead to identity correlation. 
* For {{gateway_product_name}}, unidirectional clipboard sharing from the host to {{gateway_product_name}} is allowed. This is <u>not</u> insecure, because {{gateway_product_name}} is not supposed to be used as a workstation. No internet-facing client application are in use there, meaning whatever "leaked" to {{gateway_product_name}} stays there because users do not run browsers or similar applications.

Shared folders are also discouraged because it weakens isolation between the guest and the host. Providing a mechanism to access files of the host system from within the guest system via a specially defined path necessarily enlarges the attack surface and provides a potential pathway for malicious actors to compromise the host. <ref>
https://forums.whonix.org/t/security-risks-of-virtualbox-shared-folders/10119
</ref> <ref>
To learn more about VirtualBox shared folders, see: [https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#sharedfolders VirtualBox Manual - Chapter 4. Guest Additions].
</ref>
<ref>
Admittedly, this recommendation does not have a strong rationale. Disabling additional features in other virtualizers or general applications will similarly lead to less code paths being utilized and arguably increasing security. VirtualBox software is not special in this regard.
</ref>

= Clipboard Sharing =

To change the clipboard sharing setting:
# Power off the virtual machine. <ref name=poweroff>Because otherwise you cannot change VirtualBox VM settings.</ref>
# Navigate to <code>VirtualBox machine settings</code> &rarr; <code>General</code> &rarr; <code>Advanced</code> &rarr; <code>Shared Clipboard</code>
# Set the preferred configuration: <code>Disabled</code>, <code>Guest to Host</code>, <code>Host to Guest</code> or <code>Bidirectional</code>.
# Power on the virtual machine again.

To learn more, see: [https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch03.html#generalsettings VirtualBox Manual - Chapter 3. Configuring Virtual Machines].

= Shared Folder =

== {{project_name}}-Default ==

{{mbox

| text    = <u>Note</u>: 
* From VirtualBox v6+ it is no longer necessary to power off the virtual machine. <br />
* For better usability, package [https://github.com/Whonix/shared-folder-help shared-folder-help] has already added user <code>user</code> to group <code>vboxsf</code>. <ref>Using [https://github.com/Whonix/shared-folder-help/blob/master/lib/systemd/system/mnt-shared-vbox.service /lib/systemd/system/mnt-shared-vbox.service].</ref>

{{Box|text=
# Navigate to the shared folder settings of the virtual machine: <code>VirtualBox</code> &rarr; <code>right-click the virtual machine</code> &rarr; <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code>Shared Folder</code>
# Click the folder icon that has a <code>+</code> symbol in the upper right-hand section of the screen.
# <code>Folder Path</code> &rarr; Navigate to the folder you want to share.
# <code>Folder Name</code> &rarr; Type: <code>shared</code>. A different folder name can be utilized, but <code>shared</code> is recommended so it is the same as the example documented below -- do <u>not</u> use <code>share</code> (without the trailing <code>d</code>)!
# Check <code>Read-only</code> if you do not want to write to that folder from within the guest.
# Check <code>Auto-mount</code>. <ref name=vboxversiondependent>
If the option is unavailable, upgrade VirtualBox.
</ref>
# <code>Mount Point</code> &rarr; Leave as is (leave it empty and do not make any changes). <ref>
Alternatively folder <code>/home/user/shared</code> can be chosen. The VirtualBox default means that folder would be owned by owner <code>root</code> and group <code>vboxsf</code>.
</ref>
# Check <code>Make Permanent</code> (if that option exists). <ref>
This is specific to the VirtualBox version; newer versions do not have this option anymore.

Check <code>Make Permanent</code> if this setting should persist after restart of the virtual machine. Otherwise this setting will be temporary.
</ref>
# Press <code>OK</code> to close shared folder dialog.
# Press <code>OK</code> to close VirtualBox settings.
# The process is now complete and the shared folder can be used.

VirtualBox shared folders are found inside the virtual machine in folder <code>/media/</code>.

By default, VirtualBox uses the prefix <code>sf_</code>.

In the above example, the <code>shared</code> folder will become <code>/media/sf_shared</code>. It can be opened using a file manager like Thunar. To open it using the the command line, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
cd /media/sf_shared
}}

# Install VirtualBox guest additions inside the VM. <ref>This step is required. Quote [https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#sharedfolders VirtualBox Manual - Chapter 4. Guest Additions]:
<blockquote>
With the shared folders feature of Oracle VM VirtualBox, you can access files of your host system from within the guest system. This is similar to how you would use network shares in Windows networks, except that shared folders do not require networking, only the Guest Additions.

{{Anchor|issue}}

= VirtualBox Guest Additions =
== Introduction ==
In {{project_name}}, VirtualBox guest additions are installed by default. <ref>
* [https://forums.whonix.org/t/installing-virtualbox-guest-addition-by-default/700 Installing VirtualBox Guest Addition by Default?]
</ref>

To avoid any issues with the guest additions, users are highly recommended to:

# Use the [[VirtualBox/Recommended_Version|Recommended VirtualBox Version for use with {{project name}}]].
# Leave installation of the recommended version of VirtualBox guest additions to {{project name}} as dcoumented and to avoid manual installation. This documentation will be updated as required. Check back later in case you have issues.

* {{project name}} 15: {{Code2|VirtualBox guest additions}} (from package [https://packages.debian.org/sid/virtualbox-guest-additions-iso <code>virtualbox-guest-additions-iso</code>]) are automatically being kept updated by [https://gitlab.com/whonix/vm-config-dist/-/blob/master/usr/bin/vbox-guest-installer <code>vbox-guest-installer</code>], which is an installation helper created by {{project name}} developers when {{project name}} is [[Operating System Software and Updates|updated]].
* {{project name}} 16: {{Code2|VirtualBox guest additions}} (from packages <code>virtualbox-guest-utils</code>, <code>virtualbox-guest-x11</code>) are installed by default and should be preferred over <code>virtualbox-guest-additions-iso</code>. <ref name=legacy15>
<code>virtualbox-guest-additions-iso</code> is still installed by default. Should there be issues with <code>virtualbox-guest-utils</code>, <code>virtualbox-guest-x11</code> as there was in past due to unavailability, then it's easier to fall back to that solution. <code>vbox-guest-installer</code>] (installation helper created by {{project name}} developers) is also still installed by default for the same purpose.
</ref>

There might be a few odd messages during [[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates|updates]] which are actually [[#Non-Issues|non-issues]]. Unless actual functionality is broken, please do not ask about odd messages as per [[Reporting_Bugs#Support_Request_Policy|Support Request Policy]].

In case of issues, see also [[VirtualBox/Troubleshooting|VirtualBox troubleshooting]] and consider a [[Reporting_Bugs|bug report]].

== virtualbox-guest-additions-iso package ==
* {{project name}} 15: Since {{project_name}} <code>15.0.1.4.8</code> the guest additions are installed from the [https://packages.debian.org/sid/virtualbox-guest-additions-iso <code>virtualbox-guest-additions-iso</code>] package during the build process of {{project name}}. ([[Dev/VirtualBox#VirtualBox_Integration|technical details]])
* {{project name}} 16: Installed by default but not used by default. <ref>
Might still be used by users who [[Release Upgrade]]ed from {{project name}} 15 to {{project name}} 16.
</ref> <ref name=legacy15 />

== virtualbox-guest-x11 package ==
* {{project name}} 15: Earlier {{project_name}} versions, used to install package <code>virtualbox-guest-x11</code> by default. This currently will not work and is discouraged. ([[Dev/VirtualBox#VirtualBox_Installation_Challenges|technical details]])
* {{project name}} 16: Installed by default.

== vbox-guest-installer ==
[https://gitlab.com/whonix/vm-config-dist/-/blob/master/usr/bin/vbox-guest-installer <code>vbox-guest-installer</code>] is an installation helper created by {{project name}} developers. It is a helper utility for better usability that allows to install {{Code2|VirtualBox guest additions}} (from package [https://packages.debian.org/sid/virtualbox-guest-additions-iso <code>virtualbox-guest-additions-iso</code>]).

* {{project name}} 15: Used.
* {{project name}} 16: Currently not in use.

== VirtualBox Guest Additions CD ==
In {{project name}} it is therefore unnecessary and discouraged to install guest additions from a VirtualBox CD. Do <code>not</code> use <s><code>VirtualBox</code> &rarr; <code>Devices</code> &rarr; <code>Insert Guest Additions CD image...</code></s>. Doing so could lead to version conflicts of the VirtualBox host version versus the VirtualBox guest additions version such as black screen, screen resolution bug, broken host to VM copy/paste and similar. <ref>
[https://forums.whonix.org/t/virtualbox-guest-additions/8998/3 Installation of VirtualBox guest additions from CD might also cause issues.]
</ref>

If you are using other operating systems ([[Other Operating Systems|custom workstation]]), using VirtualBox Guest Additions CD is OK. In that case, issues should be resolved as per [[Free Support Principle]] because it would be [[unspecific]] to {{project name}}.

== VirtualBox Guest Additions Security ==
General concerns have been raised about the security of VirtualBox, for example see the article [https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=OTk5Mw The VirtualBox Kernel Driver Is Tainted Crap] <ref>http://www.webcitation.org/6HqJVN0br</ref>. However, this refers to the kernel driver (on the host), not guest additions. For opposite viewpoints, see [https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/08/msg00112.html here]  and [https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/08/msg00116.html here].

= Alternatives =
It is possible to achieve similar functionality without installing guest additions:
* For file exchange with {{project_name}}, see: [[File Transfer]] and [[File Sharing]].
* To achieve a higher screen resolution, see: [[VirtualBox/Higher Screen Resolution without installing VirtualBox Guest Additions|Higher Screen Resolution without VirtualBox Guest Additions]].
* To achieve mouse integration, it is possible to set a USB tablet in VirtualBox settings. This is recommended against because it requires adding a USB controller to VirtualBox. (<code>VirtualBox</code> &rarr; <code>Right-click on Virtual Machine</code> &rarr; <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code>System</code> &rarr; <code>Enable absolute pointing device</code>)

= Miscellaneous =
== Uninstall virtualbox-guest-additions-iso ==
This is discouraged and should not be required. However, if you wish to uninstall VirtualBox guest additions as installed by <code>vbox-guest-installer</code> by {{Project name}} developers, follow the steps below.

'''1.'''

* {{project name}} 15: Purge package <code>virtualbox-guest-additions-iso</code>. This will result in <code>vbox-guest-installer</code> by {{Project name}} developers in future doing effectively nothing. {{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt purge virtualbox-guest-additions-iso
}}
* {{project name}} 16: No purge of package <code>virtualbox-guest-additions-iso</code> required since <code>vbox-guest-installer</code> is disabled by default.

'''2.''' Remove VirtualBox guest additions (previously installed by {{project name}} from <code>virtualbox-guest-additions-iso</code>. Run VirtualBox guest additions uninstaller by VirtualBox developers. {{CodeSelect|code=
sudo /usr/sbin/vbox-uninstall-guest-additions
}}

== Debugging ==
To help debug issues, inspect the following logs and services.

{{CodeSelect|code=
cat /var/log/vboxadd-install.log
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl status vboxadd
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl status vboxadd-service.service
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
ls -la /opt/VBoxGuestAdditions-*/init/
}}

=== Kernel Upgrades ===
The following issue is happening during kernel [[Operating System Software and Updates|upgrades]].

<pre>
/etc/kernel/postinst.d/vboxadd:
VirtualBox Guest Additions: Building the modules for kernel 5.6.0-0.bpo.2-amd64.
Failed to rename process, ignoring: Operation not permitted
update-initramfs terminated by signal TERM.
</pre>

Workaround in short: two reboots required.

Workaround details: This results in guest additions being non-functional after the next reboot. During the next reboot VirtualBox guest additions will automatically detect the missing kernel modules for the upgraded kernel and build them. Therefore when rebooting yet another time the issue should be resolved until the next kernel upgrade.

Please [[contribute]] to generic bug reproduction:

* Conceptually: [[Reporting_Bugs#Generic_Bug_Reproduction|Generic Bug Reproduction]]
* Specifically: [[VirtualBox/Troubleshooting#VirtualBox_Generic_Bug_Reproduction|VirtualBox Generic Bug Reproduction]] and [[#Debugging|Debugging]].

See also {{project name}} specific technical information, [[Dev/VirtualBox#VirtualBox_Integration|VirtualBox Integration]].

One long term solution might be replacing initramfs-tools with dracut but that needs further research and development work. ([https://forums.whonix.org/t/replacing-initramfs-tools-with-dracut/4487 develpoment discussion], [https://github.com/dracutdevs/dracut/issues/1565 issue])

Forum discussion:<br />

== Non-Issues ==
<s>If the following message appears during a kernel upgrade, it is a non-issue.</s>

None.
