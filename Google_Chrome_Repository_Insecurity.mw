== Summary ==

As per 14 March 2021, Google wants you to install a weak cryptographic key (DSA key with only 1024 bits) as a Debian package manager APT key.

Repository download happens over plain http without encryption/authentication (TLS) (http'''s''').

== Source ==
=== Signing Key ===
As per <code>14 March 2021</code>, Google wants you to run the following command. ([http://web.archive.org/web/20210314103851/https://www.google.com/linuxrepositories/ archived])

<pre>
wget -q -O - https://dl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | sudo apt-key add -
</pre>

This effectively results in installing a weak cryptographic key (DSA key with only 1024 bits) as a Debian package manager APT key.

What this does is using the <code>wget</code> command line downloader to download an APT signing key and then using Debian's <code>apt-key</code> utility to install the signing key to the system's APT keyring <code>/etc/apt/trusted.gpg</code>. Sidenote: both <code>apt-key</code> and <code>/etc/apt/trusted.gpg</code> are deprecated by Debian <ref>
Quote https://blog.jak-linux.org/2021/02/18/apt-2.2/

<blockquote>apt-key was made obsolete in version 0.7.25.1, released in January 2010, by /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d becoming a supported place to drop additional keyring files, and was since then only intended for deleting keys in the legacy trusted.gpg keyring.</blockquote>

The first key shows <code>dsa1024</code> which means a DSA key with only 1024 bits.

In January 2011 the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) stated, [https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-131a.pdf quote]:

<blockquote>Disallowed after 2013</blockquote>
