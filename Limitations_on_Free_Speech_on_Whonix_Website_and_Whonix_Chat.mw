== Free Speech Limitations ==

First, I will openly admit that we have a free speech 'problem' in the {{project name}} forums, chat, wiki and comments sections insofar as material or opinion that might fall afoul of the law is generally removed. 

What issues are discussed and for how long is left to the sole discretion of the {{project name}} moderation team. The {{project name}} [[Policy of Whonix Website and Whonix Chat|Policy of Whonix Website and Whonix Chat]] clearly outlines forum goals, rules and objectionable use of the infrastructure.

One case in point is the "Off-topic" sub-forum in {{project name}} which was closed in the recent past. My reasoning was that it was better to separate politics and other controversial issues and opinions from the {{project name}} project. Also, due to the high volume of posts on controversial or sensitive topics, it was difficult to follow them all. This meant it was safer to close the sub-forum rather than risk unforeseen legal ramifications in the future.

== Personal Liability ==

The reader might have noticed the word 'I' is used throughout this entry. This is because as the {{project name}} founder and trademark owner I must consider a number of personal and legal responsibilities with regards to published content. It is simply impossible for one person to achieve all of the following:

# [[What we do|Maintain {{project_name}}]]; <u>and</u>
# Simultaneously provide a free speech platform, which necessitates:
* Staying up-to-date on developments in inter-jurisdictional legislation.
* Following nearly all posts. <ref>I may not even be obliged to do so, depending on the jurisdiction in question.</ref>
* Being ready to defend any opinion that I do not personally hold in legal proceedings.
* Having financial resources to defend against legal actions.
* Contemplating personal liability costs if legal proceedings are lost.

So far, despite an open offer, no other person or entity has approached me and been willing to take on the personal liability risk. Unless this situation changes, no user of {{project name}} infrastructure should complain about limitations on free speech. It is easy for anyone to demand an 'everything goes' policy, but this ignores risks like regulatory changes, legal challenges, and stiff penalties leveled against individuals or corporations in recent history.

If any person or organization is ready to be both identifiable and sign a binding contract to take responsibility for any user-posted opinions on the {{project name}} website, then I am willing to facilitate this arrangement. This is an unlikely outcome, since even those requesting free speech would probably decline the offer once the legal ramifications were better understood. <ref>Following detailed legal research on the matter.</ref>
