In a fashion similar to Windows platforms, Apple operating systems also pose many security and privacy threats.

| 
* Files on devices can be deleted if they were downloaded from sources competing with Apple companies. <br />
* Intentional backdoors allow remote root privileges, wipes and deletion of applications.
|-

| 
* An insecure design allows execution of malicious code by applications and the extraction of messaging history.

* Devices are bricked if fixed by an "unauthorized" repair shop. <br />
* Devices are bricked that were unlocked without permission.

| 
* Biometric markers like fingerprints are used for device authorization. <br />
* Extensive personal information is sent to Apple servers, such as: <br />
** Automatic uploads of photos and videos used by certain applications; and <br />
** Unsaved documents and program files (without permission). <br />
* Search terms and location information are sent to Apple. <br />
* System files are scanned.

! scope="row"| User Control and Freedoms
| 
* Allowable programs like media, political, bitcoin and health-focused applications, and games are censored. <br />
* Arbitrary limits are imposed on the use of software. <br />
* Digital restrictions mechanisms are imposed. <br />
* System upgrades are forced without consent. <br />
* Older versions of operating systems cannot be installed. <br />
* It is impossible to manually fix system security bugs that Apple have not addressed. <br />
* User interfaces are designed to make specific options hard to find and enable/disable.

= Recommendation =

Based on the preceding sections and analysis, it is strongly recommended to learn more about GNU/Linux and install a suitable distribution that safeguards rights to secure and private computing. Otherwise, significant effort is required to play "whack-a-mole" with Windows and [[Malware|malware]], which routinely subjects users to surveillance, limits choice, purposefully undermines security, and harasses via advertisements, forced updates, remote removal of applications without consent, and so on.

= GNU/Linux Hosts =

A [https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software Free Software] OS that respects user freedom is the only practical choice when it comes to privacy and security. It also comes with many advanced [[Operating_System_Hardening#Hardened_Kernels|anti-exploit mechanisms]] built-in.

Use GNU/Linux on the host and prefer in-repository software that is automatically gpg-signed and installed from the distributor's repositories by the package manager. This is far safer than downloading programs from the Internet like Windows adherents are required to do.

== Recommended GNU/Linux Distribution ==

Interested readers can find a complete list of reasons to use Debian [https://www.debian.org/intro/why_debian here]. For download, verification and installation instructions, see [[Debian Tips|Debian Tips]]. 

In the past, virtually any GNU/Linux distribution could be recommended in order to protect privacy, however Ubuntu's history of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(user_interface)#Privacy_controversy data-mining] makes it an unsuitable choice. <ref>https://fixubuntu.com/</ref> Ubuntu's February 2016 Privacy Policy allowed search terms entered into the dash to be sent to Ubuntu and selected third parties to "complement" search results, along with the IP address. Fortunately this text has now been removed in the [https://www.ubuntu.com/legal/dataprivacy latest iteration of the document].

For additional reasons to avoid Ubuntu or Ubuntu-derived distributions, expand this section.
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
Ubuntu's paltry contributions to the upstream Libre projects they heavily rely upon is a policy decision and not a coincidence. Canonical founder Mark Shuttleworth has stated: "It is absolutely true we have no interest in the core fundamentals of the Linux kernel, none whatsoever." <ref>https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2168086/canonical-linux-kernel</ref>

Canonical only bothers to majorly contribute in any way when forking significant projects; for example, Wayland into Mir, GNOME into Unity <ref>https://ask.fedoraproject.org/en/question/25127/how-to-build-unity-in-fedora/</ref>, and .deb packages incompatible with Debian because of zstd compression. <ref>https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Ubuntu-Zstd-Deb-Packages</ref> This appears to be a consistent attempt to fragment the software stack to lock in users and put pressure on competing distributions and vendors. <ref>https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/25376.html</ref> <ref>https://www.linux-magazine.com/Online/Blogs/Off-the-Beat-Bruce-Byfield-s-Blog/Mir-vs.-Wayland-show-why-upstream-projects-matter</ref>

The Ubuntu Contributor License Agreement gives them complete power over patents that cover contributed code. Essentially they are granted the right to re-license this code under any license of their choice, including a proprietary one.

Ubuntu also has a history of treating staff in a hostile fashion. For example, the Kubuntu spin project lead was unilaterally removed without warning and contrary to wishes of his team members. <ref>https://kver.wordpress.com/2015/05/27/making-sense-of-the-kubuntucanonical-leadership-spat/</ref> Canonical also pilfered donation funds originally meant for desktop spin projects (Kubuntu, Lubuntu and others). In Kubuntu's case, after funding was abruptly dropped, Blue Systems had to step in to save the popular project. <ref>https://www.pcworld.com/article/2998647/operating-systems/kubuntus-founder-resigns-accuses-canonical-of-defrauding-donors-and-violating-copyright.html</ref> <ref>https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/kubuntu-devel/2012-February/005782.html</ref>

Canonical has also been applying an absurd intellectual property (IP) policy over packages in its repositories for years. This resulted in claims that Canonical owns the copyright over any binaries compiled by their servers. After the FSF stepped in and arranged a resolution over a period of two years, the policy was amended to state that Canonicalâ€™s IP policy cannot override packages with GPL licenses. However, this now means that any package with a permissive license is now copyrighted by Canonical. <ref>https://www.fsf.org/news/canonical-updated-licensing-terms</ref> <ref>https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/37113.html</ref> 

Unfortunately, downstream forks based on Ubuntu cannot be relied upon either. For example, the popular Linux Mint distribution was threatened with being cut off from access to Ubuntu infrastructure unless they caved in to Canonical's binary licensing terms. <ref>https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=152450</ref> Since then, Linux Mint has developed a version based on Debian instead. Canonical's vague trademark and IP policy has become toxic for downstream distributions. Many have made the smart choice to re-base on Debian instead of Ubuntu over the years including Kali, {{project name}} <ref> [[Dev/Operating_System#Switch_from_Ubuntu_to_Debian]]</ref> and others. <ref>https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/45939.html</ref>

A final major concern is Canonical's friendly relationship with Microsoft. This should make all GNU/Linux users uncomfortable, given Microsoft's strategy of "Embrace, Extend, Extinguish" with respect to Free Software. <ref>https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-and-canonical-partner-to-bring-ubuntu-to-windows-10/</ref>
