= Overview =

There is a common assumption that GNU/Linux is a very secure operating system. This is [https://forums.whonix.org/t/fixing-the-desktop-linux-security-model/9172 very far from the truth].

The assumption that free software is inherently more secure than proprietary software is incorrect. Linux is a perfect example of this as it is one of the most popular free software projects yet severely lacking in security.

Free software also does not mean a project cannot be backdoored. There are hundreds of vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel [https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Syzbot-and-the-Tale-of-Thousand-Kernel-Bugs-Dmitry-Vyukov-Google.pdf found each month] and you cannot tell whether they were intentional or not. Backdoors will not be obvious. They will be obscure, easy to miss vulnerabilities.

Proprietary operating systems such as Windows or macOS are far more secure than a standard Linux distribution although sometimes at a forfeit of privacy. Windows and macOS have invested far more work into things such as sandboxing, exploit mitigations and verified boot than Linux. An example of this is Windows 10's Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) implementation, [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secbp/control-flow-guard Control-Flow Guard] although CFI is near non-existent on Linux platforms. Another example is macOS's [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208330 full verified boot] unlike most Linux distributions which provide an incomplete form covering only the boot chain.

There is more malware available for Windows and macOS but that is due to their larger user base. Relying entirely on security through obscurity by using a less used platform such as Linux is not a good idea.

= Recommendation =

Based on the preceding sections and analysis, it is strongly recommended to learn more about GNU/Linux and install a suitable distribution although at a severe security decrease. Otherwise, significant effort is required to play "whack-a-mole" with Windows, which routinely subjects users to surveillance and freedom restrictions.

Remember that security will be substantially decreased until a better solution other than Debian is available.

In the past, virtually any GNU/Linux distribution could be recommended in order to protect privacy, however Ubuntu's history of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(user_interface)#Privacy_controversy data-mining] makes it an unsuitable choice. <ref>https://fixubuntu.com/</ref> Ubuntu's February 2016 Privacy Policy allowed search terms entered into the dash to be sent to Ubuntu and selected third parties to "complement" search results, along with the IP address. Fortunately this text has now been removed in the [https://www.ubuntu.com/legal/dataprivacy latest iteration of the document].

For additional reasons to avoid Ubuntu or Ubuntu-derived distributions, expand this section.
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
Ubuntu's paltry contributions to the upstream Libre projects they heavily rely upon is a policy decision and not a coincidence. Canonical founder Mark Shuttleworth has stated: "It is absolutely true we have no interest in the core fundamentals of the Linux kernel, none whatsoever." <ref>https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2168086/canonical-linux-kernel</ref>

Canonical only bothers to majorly contribute in any way when forking significant projects; for example, Wayland into Mir, GNOME into Unity <ref>https://ask.fedoraproject.org/en/question/25127/how-to-build-unity-in-fedora/</ref>, and .deb packages incompatible with Debian because of zstd compression. <ref>https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Ubuntu-Zstd-Deb-Packages</ref> This appears to be a consistent attempt to fragment the software stack to lock in users and put pressure on competing distributions and vendors. <ref>https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/25376.html</ref> <ref>https://www.linux-magazine.com/Online/Blogs/Off-the-Beat-Bruce-Byfield-s-Blog/Mir-vs.-Wayland-show-why-upstream-projects-matter</ref>

The Ubuntu Contributor License Agreement gives them complete power over patents that cover contributed code. Essentially they are granted the right to re-license this code under any license of their choice, including a proprietary one.

Ubuntu also has a history of treating staff in a hostile fashion. For example, the Kubuntu spin project lead was unilaterally removed without warning and contrary to wishes of his team members. <ref>https://kver.wordpress.com/2015/05/27/making-sense-of-the-kubuntucanonical-leadership-spat/</ref> Canonical also pilfered donation funds originally meant for desktop spin projects (Kubuntu, Lubuntu and others). In Kubuntu's case, after funding was abruptly dropped, Blue Systems had to step in to save the popular project. <ref>https://www.pcworld.com/article/2998647/operating-systems/kubuntus-founder-resigns-accuses-canonical-of-defrauding-donors-and-violating-copyright.html</ref> <ref>https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/kubuntu-devel/2012-February/005782.html</ref>

Canonical has also been applying an absurd intellectual property (IP) policy over packages in its repositories for years. This resulted in claims that Canonical owns the copyright over any binaries compiled by their servers. After the FSF stepped in and arranged a resolution over a period of two years, the policy was amended to state that Canonicalâ€™s IP policy cannot override packages with GPL licenses. However, this now means that any package with a permissive license is now copyrighted by Canonical. <ref>https://www.fsf.org/news/canonical-updated-licensing-terms</ref> <ref>https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/37113.html</ref> 

Unfortunately, downstream forks based on Ubuntu cannot be relied upon either. For example, the popular Linux Mint distribution was threatened with being cut off from access to Ubuntu infrastructure unless they caved in to Canonical's binary licensing terms. <ref>https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=152450</ref> Since then, Linux Mint has developed a version based on Debian instead. Canonical's vague trademark and IP policy has become toxic for downstream distributions. Many have made the smart choice to re-base on Debian instead of Ubuntu over the years including Kali, {{project name}} <ref> [[Dev/Operating_System#Switch_from_Ubuntu_to_Debian]]</ref> and others. <ref>https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/45939.html</ref>

A final major concern is Canonical's friendly relationship with Microsoft. This should make all GNU/Linux users uncomfortable, given Microsoft's strategy of "Embrace, Extend, Extinguish" with respect to Free Software. <ref>https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-and-canonical-partner-to-bring-ubuntu-to-windows-10/</ref>
