The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

We need to reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute user contributions freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.

A Work made available to us may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:

* the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;
* moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
* publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;
* rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
* rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
* database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
* other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, you hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waive, abandon, and surrender all of your Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work

You contribute for the benefit of {{name}} and to the detriment of your heirs and successors, fully intending that your copyright assignment to us shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by your express Statement of Purpose.
