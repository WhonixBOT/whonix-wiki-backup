'''''DRAFT! UNFINISHED!'''''

== Defaults Discussion ==
Reasons for not enabling this feature by default:
* The feature is not yet implemented.
* Usefulness.
** Not even Tor Browser does pin the Certificate yet. (The Tor Project ticket: [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3555 enhancement: Pin *.torproject.org's certs in TBB]) Mike also says "low priority", where Patrick disagrees. However, Tor Browser at least [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6098#comment:4 enforces HSTS for *.torproject.org].
* Implementation.
** torbrowser-launcher is not installable from Debian stable at time of writing. TODO: expand
** Whonix is still installing [https://github.com/Whonix/tb-updater tb-updater] rather than [https://github.com/micahflee/torbrowser-launcher/ torbrowser-launcher] by default because, see [https://phabricator.whonix.org/T18 ticket]. So the certificate file {{Code2|/usr/share/torbrowser-launcher/torproject.pem}} is not installed by default.
** It might be a Debian packaging bug to have whonixcheck depend on torbrowser-launcher for this purpose? Ignorable point, because whonixcheck is too specific to be included into Debian official repository anyhow.
** We would also have to install torbrowser-launcher on Whonix-Gateway, so the certificate file {{Code2|/usr/share/torbrowser-launcher/torproject.pem}} gets installed by default. But since by Whonix design, users must not use Tor Browser in Whonix-Gateway, we would have to hide (config-package-dev displace) torbrowser-launcher's start menu entries as well as build a wrapper around its binaries to warn against this. This is doable, but no one has implemented that yet.
** We are unaware of any other package or even project that does provide SSL certificates for direct pinning (do not confuse this with SSL CA pinning), that we could rely on. Apparently there is not even a list of certain domains and their SSL certificates (public key hashes) (do not confuse this with SSL CA pinning).
* Maintenance burden.
** [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5789 The Tor Project (TPO) refused to maintain an OpenPGP signed certificate]. (They are excused: maintenance burden. TODO: expand)
** Relying on [https://github.com/micahflee/torbrowser-launcher/ torbrowser-launcher] to maintain The Tor Project's SSL certificate file {{Code2|/usr/share/torbrowser-launcher/torproject.pem}}.
*** One time the maintainer of torbrowser-launcher was busy and needed ~1 month to upgrade TPO's SSL certificate file. ([https://github.com/micahflee/torbrowser-launcher/issues/84 reference]) He is excused, because he is a volunteer maintaining the software, under no obligations, probably earning no money with torbrowser-launcher, having other obligations. This is Libre Software. Thank you for torbrowser-launcher!
*** The plan of the maintainer of torbrowser-launcher is to wait until the certificate breaks before upgrading it. This is already the best the maintainer can do in the absence of better support from TPO for this use case. No blame here. Everyone is excused here, also TPO, since maintaining this adds up to the maintenance burden. ([https://github.com/micahflee/torbrowser-launcher/issues/45 reference])
*** See also [https://github.com/micahflee/torbrowser-launcher/issues?q=pin torbrowser-launcher issues search "pin"] for eventual further issues with pinning.

Бинарные опционы – это финансовый инструмент, который позволяет зарабатывать за счет прогнозов на изменение цен рыночных активов. Говоря простыми словами, бинарный опцион – это ставка на то, повысится ли цена или упадет. Сразу скажу, бинарные опционы – это не игра, поэтому относится к ним нужно соответственно.
