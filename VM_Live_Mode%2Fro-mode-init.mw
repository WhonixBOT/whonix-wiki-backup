= Introduction =
As an alternative <ref>
To the default method documented on [[{{project name short}} Live|{{project name}} Live]].
</ref> in {{project name}} [[VirtualBox]] or {{project name}} [[KVM]], it is also possible to automatically detect if the disk is set to read-only and enable live mode automatically using the <code>ro-mode-init</code> package.

<code>ro-mode-init</code> is currently less tested than [[grub-live|grub-live]] / [[{{project name short}} Live|{{project name}} Live]].

'''4.''' Set the VM disk to read-only.

The [[#Read-only_VM_Setting|read-only VM]] setting is necessary (see below), otherwise the VM disk will always boot into persistent mode.

= Read-only VM Setting =

== VirtualBox ==

=== Read-only disk on VirtualBox ===

To boot into live mode, apply the following steps.

{{VirtualBox Read Only Disk}}

=== Read-write disk on VirtualBox ===

To boot into read-write mode again, simply revert this change.

# Power off the machine.
# From the command line run.

Use the syntax below.

{{CodeSelect|code=
VBoxManage setextradata vmname "VBoxInternal/Devices/lsilogicsas/0/LUN#0/AttachedDriver/Config/ReadOnly"
}}

Replace <code>vmname</code> with the name of the actual VM name.

== KVM ==

=== Read-only disk on KVM ===

To boot into live mode, apply the following steps:

# Power off the machine.
# Set the hard disk to read-only in the virt-manager GUI.
# Power on the machine and select to boot into live mode.

=== Read-write disk on KVM ===

To boot into normal mode again, simply revert this change:

# Power off the machine.
# Set the hard disk to read-write in the virt-manager GUI.
# Power on the machine and boot into read-write mode.

= Debugging =

An inconsistent filesystem will likely result in errors during booting in live mode. For instance, inconsistencies can arise when the VM is killed instead of performing a normal shutdown in persistent mode. Therefore to ensure it is consistent, run <code>fsck</code> in persistent mode. Debian automatically does this during boot. VMs running in live mode can be killed without problems.

In the case of non-<code>fsck</code> related errors using <code>ro-mode-init</code> (like dropping to an initramfs shell), add the following to the kernel command line/GRUB menu for easier debugging:

debug=1 break=init-premount
