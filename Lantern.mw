'''UNFINISHED!'''

Testers only!

It is possible to configure Tor to use Lantern as proxy to establish the following tunnel:<br />
'''User -> Lantern -> Tor -> Internet'''

If you want to do this, apply the following instructions.

[[Qubes-Whonix]] only! [[Non-Qubes-Whonix]] is [[unsupported]].

In case you want to do that, it is recommended to read the following related wiki article: [[Tunnels/Introduction]]

For current limitations, see also blog post / forum discussion:<br />
TODO

Create a new standalone ProxyVM called Lantern-Gateway based on Debian-8 template.

You need to unload Qubes iptables rules in the Lantern-Gateway ProxyVM. See: [[Dev/Firewall_Unload]]

IP Forwarding in the JonDo-Gateway ProxyVM could/should be disabled since it is not required. TODO: document how

Install missing lantern dependency. (TODO: debian/control should declare a depends. Check if lantern developers are aware of this issue and report a bug if necessary.)

<pre>
sudo apt-get install libappindicator3-1
</pre>

Check if the downloaded deb file is still the right file. Go to https://getlantern.org/ and check for desktop, linux downloads.

<pre>
curl --tlsv1.2 --proto =https https://s3.amazonaws.com/lantern/lantern-installer-beta-64-bit.deb --output ~/lantern-installer-beta-64-bit.deb
</pre>

Install lantern.

<pre>
sudo dpkg -i ~/lantern-installer-beta-64-bit.deb
</pre>

Start lantern while listening on all, not just the internal, network interfaces so it gets reachable from sys-whonix.

<pre>
lantern -addr 0.0.0.0:8788
</pre>

<ref>
In Lantern-Gateway, check if lantern's socks port is functional.

<pre>
curl --tlsv1.2 --proto =https --socks5-hostname socks5h://127.0.0.1:8788 https://check.torproject.org
</pre>
</ref>

Shut down sys-whonix if running. Set sys-whonix NetVM to Lantern-Gateway. Restart sys-whonix.

<ref>
In sys-whonix, test if Tor is able to the socks proxy that Lantern is providing.

<pre>
curl.anondist-orig --tlsv1.2 --proto =https --socks5-hostname socks5h://10.137.11.1:8788 https://check.torproject.org
</pre>
</ref>

In sys-whonix. {{Open_/etc/tor/torrc}}

Add the following. 10.137.11.1 is just an example. You need to replace 10.137.11.1 with the IP of your Lantern-Gateway ProxyVM. You could run the following command within sys-whonix to find out the IP of your Lantern-Gateway ProxyVM.
<code>qubesdb-read /qubes-gateway</code>

<pre>
Socks5Proxy 10.137.11.1:8788
</pre>

{{Reload_Tor}}

Done. Tor will use Lantern as proxy.
