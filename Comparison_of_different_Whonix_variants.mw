= Comparison of Different {{project_name}} Variants =

The security and usability of the {{project name}} platform is significantly affected by the hardware and virtualization configuration, and whether a {{custom workstation product name}} is created. [[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]] is currently recommended as providing the best combination of security and usability, although it has [https://www.qubes-os.org/hcl/ strict hardware requirements].

Virtual machines can provide the following security-related features:

* <u>Network isolation</u>: Connections can easily be forced through Tor.
* <u>Hardware isolation</u>: Unique hardware serials can be hidden.
* <u>Roll back feature</u>: Users can revert to clean and/or working snapshots.
* <u>Multi-level security</u>: Multiple clones / VMs / DisposableVMs provide significant protection.

In comparison, live CDs provide:

* <u>Non-persistence</u>: This increases safety in the event of a software compromise. <ref>Unless sophisticated and targeted malware manages to leverage the exploit, leading to a compromise of firmware or other persistent systems (like BIOS).</ref>
* <u>Anti-forensics capability and plausible deniability</u>: If the computer is powered down and RAM has faded or been wiped, remnants of critical information like encryption keys should be impossible to retrieve.
* <u>Update issues</u>: It is difficult to roll out security updates and maintain a fully up-to-date system.

== Operating System Configurations ==

{{project_name}} provides multiple operating system options:

* <u>Debian {{Stable_project_version_based_on_Debian_codename}} GNU/Linux</u>: The Default-Download-Version is recommended for most users.
* <u>[[Other Operating Systems]]</u>: Windows, FreeBSD, other GNU/Linux, and Android {{custom workstation product name}} are possible.

| text    = Users should refer to [[Other Operating Systems#Security_Comparison:_{{project_name}}-Download-Workstation_vs._{{custom workstation product name short}}|Security Comparison: {{project_name}}-Download-Workstation vs. {{custom workstation product name}}]] before choosing this option. A number of anonymity protections must be manually configured in {{custom workstation product name}}.

There is also a [[HardenedGentooTG|Hardened Gentoo-based {{gateway_product_name}}]]. This is not recommended as it is outdated, requires a contributor, and is for experts only.

== Security Comparison: {{project_name}}-Download-Workstation vs. {{project_name}}-Custom-Workstation ==

See [[Other Operating Systems#Security_Comparison:_{{project_name}}-Download-Workstation_vs._{{custom workstation product name}} | Security Comparison: {{project_name}}-Download-Workstation vs. {{custom workstation product name}}]]. Unless otherwise stated, the documentation and design refers to the Default-Download-Version.
