= Comparison of Different {{project_name}} Variants =

The security and usability of the {{project name}} platform is significantly affected by the hardware and virtualization configuration, and whether a {{custom workstation product name}} is created. [[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]] is currently recommended as providing the best combination of security and usability, although it has [https://www.qubes-os.org/hcl/ strict hardware requirements].

!| '''Variant'''
!| '''Number of systems'''

!| '''Usability'''
|-
| Standard [[Download|Binary Download]]
| host+VM+VM=3
| Basic
| Easy to redistribute and install
|-  class="odd"
| [[Physical Isolation]] with Bare-metal Gateway
| host+VM+host=3
| Equivalent to the standard binary download
| Difficult to install and for advanced users only
|-
| [[Physical Isolation]] with Virtualized Gateway
| host+VM+host+VM=4
| Higher attack surface
| Easier to deploy. Four operating systems must be kept updated
|-
| [[Physical Isolation]] without any Virtualization
| host+host=2
| Nearly the same as standard Physical Isolation. <ref>For further discussion of this issue, see: [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/05abffad/ More or Less Protection inside a VM?]</ref> Without virtual machines, there is no protection against hardware fingerprinting
| Difficult to install and for advanced users only

| [[Qubes]]
| dom0+VM+VM=3
| Better compartmentalization. See: [[Qubes/Why_use_Qubes_over_other_Virtualizers|Why use Qubes over other Virtualizers?]]

Virtual machines can provide the following security-related features:
* <u>Network isolation</u>: Connections can easily be forced through Tor.
* <u>Hardware isolation</u>: Unique hardware serials can be hidden.
* <u>Roll back feature</u>: Users can revert to clean and/or working snapshots.
* <u>Multi-level security</u>: Multiple clones / VMs / DisposableVMs provide significant protection.

In comparison, live CDs provide:
* <u>Non-persistence</u>: This increases safety in the event of a software compromise. <ref>Unless sophisticated and targeted malware manages to leverage the exploit, leading to a compromise of firmware or other persistent systems (like BIOS).</ref>
* <u>Anti-forensics capability and plausible deniability</u>: If the computer is powered down and RAM has faded or been wiped, remnants of critical information like encryption keys should be impossible to retrieve.
* <u>Update issues</u>: It is difficult to roll out security updates and maintain a fully up-to-date system.

== Operating System Configurations ==

{{project_name}} provides multiple operating system options:

* <u>Debian {{Stable_project_version_based_on_Debian_codename}} GNU/Linux</u>: The Default-Download-Version is recommended for most users.
* <u>[[Other Operating Systems]]</u>: Windows, FreeBSD, other GNU/Linux, and Android {{custom workstation product name}} are possible. 

{{mbox

| text    = Users should refer to [[Other Operating Systems#Security_Comparison:_{{project_name}}-Download-Workstation_vs._{{custom workstation product name short}}|Security Comparison: {{project_name}}-Download-Workstation vs. {{custom workstation product name}}]] before choosing this option. A number of anonymity protections must be manually configured in {{custom workstation product name}}.

There is also a [[HardenedGentooTG|Hardened Gentoo-based {{gateway_product_name}}]]. This is not recommended as it is outdated, requires a contributor, and is for experts only.

== Security Comparison: {{project_name}}-Download-Workstation vs. {{project_name}}-Custom-Workstation ==

See [[Other Operating Systems#Security_Comparison:_{{project_name}}-Download-Workstation_vs._{{custom workstation product name}} | Security Comparison: {{project_name}}-Download-Workstation vs. {{custom workstation product name}}]]. Unless otherwise stated, the documentation and design refers to the Default-Download-Version.
