{|   class="wikitable"
!| Name

!| Usability
|-
| Standard [[Download]] version
| host+VM+VM=3
| Basic.
| Easily redistributable and installable.
|-  class="odd"
| [[Physical Isolation]] with bare metal Gateway
| host+VM+host=3
| Stronger than Standard Download version.
| Difficult to install, advanced users only.
|-
| [[Physical Isolation]] with virtualized Gateway
| host+VM+host+VM=4
| Higher attack surface.
| Easier to deploy. Four operating systems must be kept updated.
|-
| [[Physical Isolation]] without any virtualization
| host+host=2
| Basically same as standard Physical Isolation.; <ref>See forum topic [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/05abffad/ More or Less Protection inside a VM?] for some more discussion.</ref> Small attack surface because:-  not using Virtual Machines.; No protection against hardware fingerprinting.;
| Difficult to install, advanced users only.

Virtual machines can provide following security related features:

* Network isolation (connections can easily be forced through tor)
* Hardware isolation (hide unique hardware serials)
* Roll back feature
* Cheap and simple multi-level security through running multiple clones/VMs

Live CDs offer:

* Non-persistence in case of software compromises
* Anti-Forensics and deniability (no encryption keys to disclose, if it's powered down and RAM is wiped/faded everything is "gone")
* But: difficult to roll out security updates

== Related to Operating System ==

Multiple options for operating system.

* Debian Wheezy GNU/Linux (Default-Download-Version, recommended!).
* See also [[Other Operating Systems]], especially [[Other Operating Systems#Security_Comparison:_Whonix-Download-Workstation_vs._Whonix-Custom-Workstation | Security Comparison: Whonix-Download-Workstation vs. Whonix-Custom-Workstation]]
* Any other, see ''Whonix Framework''.
* There is [[HardenedGentooTG | Hardened Gentoo based Whonix-Gateway]]. (outdated, experts only, needs maintainer!)

== Security Comparison: Whonix-Download-Workstation vs. Whonix-Custom-Workstation ==

See [[Other Operating Systems#Security_Comparison:_Whonix-Download-Workstation_vs._Whonix-Custom-Workstation | Security Comparison: Whonix-Download-Workstation vs. Whonix-Custom-Workstation]].

Unless otherwise stated, the documentation and design is about the Default-Download-Version.
