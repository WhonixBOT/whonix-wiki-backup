|  align="left" | [[PhysicalIsolation]] with virtualized Gateway
|  align="left" | host+VM+host+VM=4
|  align="left" | Higher attack surface.
|  align="left" | Easier to deploy. Four operating systems must be kept updated.
|-  class="odd"
|  align="left" | [[PhysicalIsolation]] without any virtualization
|  align="left" | host+host=2
|  align="left" | Basically same as standard Physical Isolation.; Smaller attack surface <sup>1</sup> because not using Virtual Machines.; No protection against hardware fingerprinting.;

Virtual machines can provide following security related features:

* Network isolation (connections can easily be forced through tor)
* Hardware isolation (hide unique hardware serials)
* Roll back feature
* Cheap and simple multi-level security through running multiple clones/VMs

Live CDs offer:

* Non-persistence in case of software compromises
* Anti-Forensics and deniability (no encryption keys to disclose, if it's powered down and RAM is wiped/faded everything is &quot;gone&quot;)
* But: difficult to roll out security updates

== Related to Operating System ==

Multiple options for operating system.

* Debian Wheezy GNU/Linux (Default-Download-Version, recommend!).
* See also [[OtherOperatingSystems]], especially [[OtherOperatingSystems#Security_Comparison:_Whonix-Download-Workstation_vs._Whonix-Custom-Workstation | Security Comparison: Whonix-Download-Workstation vs. Whonix-Custom-Workstation]]
* Any other, see ''Whonix Framework''.
* There is [[HardenedGentooTG | Hardened Gentoo based Whonix-Gateway]]. (outdated, experts only, needs maintainer!)

== Security Comparison: Whonix-Download-Workstation vs. Whonix-Custom-Workstation ==

See [[OtherOperatingSystems#Security_Comparison:_Whonix-Download-Workstation_vs._Whonix-Custom-Workstation | Security Comparison: Whonix-Download-Workstation vs. Whonix-Custom-Workstation]].

Unless otherwise stated, the documentation and design is about the Default-Download-Version.
