{{project_name}} can be <u>paired</u> with any other suitable anonymizing network. This means the other network will be tunneled through [[Tor]].

''In theory'' Tor could be completely <u>replaced</u> with another suitable anonymizing network; see [[Dev/Technical Introduction#{{project_name}} Framework|{{project_name}} Framework]]. Development in this area has stalled due to a lack of interest from users, upstream developers and {{project name}} developers. Interested readers can refer to the [[Dev/Inspiration|Inspiration]] entry, which outlines some research in addition to theoretical and practical work completed to date. 

In general, the [[Dev/Technical Introduction#{{project_name}} Framework|{{project_name}} Framework]] is agnostic about which anonymizing network is in use. The primary reason {{project name}} started with Tor was because all developers were Tor users. It only occurred to developers much later on that alternatives could be used.

Unlike the Tor network, at the moment {{project name}} support for other anonymizing networks is fairly rudimentary. Although {{project name}} developers have great respect for Tor alternatives, along with their developers and users, they are simply more accustomed to the Tor network (which is also a personal preference). It is also very difficult to simultaneously stay up-to-date, maintain equal interest, and be fully educated about a host of other anonymizing networks.

In the event a new developer joins the {{project name}} project who actively supports a Tor alternative, then equal support could be provided. For example, there is not much point in a separate 'JonDoBOX', if most of the knowledge and code is shared.
