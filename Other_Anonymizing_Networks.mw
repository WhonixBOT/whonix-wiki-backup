= Introduction =

== Intro ==

{{project_name}} can work together with any other suited Anonymizing Networks. This means the other network will be tunneled through [[Tor]].

'''In theory''' also Tor could be completely exchanged with any other suited anonymizing network, see [[Dev/Technical Introduction#{{project_name}} Framework|{{project_name}} Framework]]. Development in this area stalled due to lack of interest from users, upstream developers and {{project name}} developers. Anyway, there has been some research, theoretical and practical work done towards such integration, see [[Dev/Inspiration]] in case you are interested. 

'''Note that all networks differ in their threat model and security! Research before you start using them.'''

== Rudimentary {{project name}} Support for Other Anonymizing Networks ==

The [[Dev/Technical Introduction#{{project_name}} Framework|{{project_name}} Framework]] is agnostic about which Anonymizing Network is being used. {{project name}} started with Tor as anonymizing network, because all developers were Tor users. The idea, that also other anonymizing network could be used, came much later.

At the moment {{project name}} support for Other Anonymizing Networks is only rudimentary and not as good as supported like the Tor network. Of course {{project name}} developers respect other anonymizing networks, their developers and their users. They are simply more accustomed to the Tor network, which is also a personal preference. It is also very hard to be equally interested, educated and to stay up to date with all other anonymizing networks at the same time.

As soon as a new developer, who actively supports the other anonymizing network, joins the {{project name}} project, this particular anonymizing network can be equally supported like the Tor network. For example, there is not much point in separate a 'JonDoBOX', if most of the knowledge and code is shared.
