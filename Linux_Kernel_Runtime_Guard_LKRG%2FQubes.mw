<u>L</u>inux <u>K</u>ernel <u>R</u>untime <u>G</u>uard (LKRG) protects the kernel. It provides security through diversity and has a similar effect to running an uncommon operating system (kernel). <ref name=homepage>

LKRG renders whole classes of kernel exploits ineffective, while making other exploits less reliable and more difficult to write; see [[Linux_Kernel_Runtime_Guard_LKRG#Features|features]] and [[Linux_Kernel_Runtime_Guard_LKRG#Security|security]]. LKRG was developed by a security professional with reviews undertaken by other high profile security professionals; see [[Linux_Kernel_Runtime_Guard_LKRG#Authorship|authorship]]. For further information, refer to the main [[Linux_Kernel_Runtime_Guard_LKRG|LKRG]] entry.

The instructions below explain how to install LKRG in [[File:qubes-logo-blue.png|15px]] Qubes Debian-based VMs. Most users will want to apply these instructions in the Qubes Debian TemplateVM.

[[File:{{project_name_short}}_old_logo.png|15px|link=Qubes-Whonix]] {{Q project name}} is supported as well, but in that case the steps to add the signing key and repository should be skipped because they are already present in {{Q project name}}.

For all other platforms [[File:Tux.png|15px]], see [[Linux_Kernel_Runtime_Guard_LKRG|LKRG]].

= Qubes VM Kernel =
Since LKRG is a kernel module, it is required (and advisable) to reconfigure the VM to use a Qubes VM kernel. <ref>
[https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/5456 cannot compile LKRG (Linux Kernel Runtime Guard) with Qubes dom0 kernel / broken gcc plugins structleak_plugin.so latent_entropy_plugin.so]

This probably occurs due to this recently closed issue which has only filtered through to Qubes OS master branches, but not the stable branches: [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/2844 kernel-devel package have broken gcc plugin].

The dom0 kernel compilation bug might be fixed after upgrades. It is unclear if it would then be advisable to use dom0 kernel.
</ref>

Any issues with Qubes VM kernel should not be confused with LKRG. Otherwise, LKRG could be falsely suspected of causing unrelated issues, which wastes time in successfully completing the configuration.
