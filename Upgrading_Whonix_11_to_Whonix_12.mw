= Upgrading =
'''[[Download|Downloading]] a new Whonix-Gateway / {{workstation_product_name}} will be probably easier than applying the following instructions for upgrading.'''

Backups are important as noted in above chapter [[#Before you start]]. Especially for [[Qubes]] users. <ref>Qubes has some more issues with distribution upgrades.</ref>

Consider doing the [[#Sanity Tests]] described above. They'll check if your system is affected by obvious grave issues, that you must fix before attempting to upgrade. If your package manager is broken, for example because you mixed packages from Debian stable with packages from Debian testing, then the upgrade may fail in the middle leaving your system in a difficult to resolve situation.

Consider keeping the full terminal (Konsole) log. Even if everything apparently worked, there might be issues after reboot. In case of a bug report in the forums you would be asked to share the upgrading log so the issue can be investigated.

Make sure you read [[#Known Issues]] above.

Become root.

<pre>
sudo su
</pre>

Do a usual [[Security_Guide#Updates|upgrade]] of your system's packages from Debian.

For [[Qubes]] users, before you proceed, it is strongly recommended that you apply the above [[#Qubes Pre Fixup]].

Enable {{project name}} {{Code2|jessie}} repository. Don't use the {{Code2|testers}} repository just yet. [Wait for new information.]

<pre>
whonix_repository --enable --codename jessie
</pre>

As a [[Qubes]] user, note that upgrades are currently only possible using Qubes' testing repository. Otherwise you run into grave issues. <ref name=qubes-grave-issues /> Switch Qubes' sources from {{Code2|wheezy}} to {{Code2|jessie-testing}} in {{Code2|/etc/apt/sources.list.d/qubes-r3.list}}. (Non-Qubes users should skip Qubes specific steps.) <ref>
Once the fixed packages migrate into stable we can drop the "-testing".
<pre>
sed -i "s/wheezy/jessie/g" /etc/apt/sources.list.d/qubes-r3.list
</pre>
</ref> Once [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/1095 the related bug] has been fixed, consider removing the "-testing" from /etc/apt/sources.list.d/qubes-r3.list.

<pre>
sed -i "s/wheezy/jessie-testing/g" /etc/apt/sources.list.d/qubes-r3.list
</pre>

Make the upgrade process less interactive. Optional. (Mostly Qubes specific unless you installed apt-listchanges.)

<pre>
export APT_LISTCHANGES_FRONTEND=text
</pre>

Enable extensive debugging so reporting eventual bugs becomes easier.

<pre>
export DEBDEBUG=1
</pre>

Update your package lists.

<pre>
apt-get update
</pre>

Upgrade.

<pre>
apt-get dist-upgrade || apt-get -f install || apt-get dist-upgrade
</pre>

It is recommended to have the {{Code2|whonix-gateway}} / {{Code2|whonix-workstation}} package installed to make sure nothing is broken. (If you like to uninstall it later as per [[{{project name short}} Debian Packages]], you're free to do so. Still, it is recommended to re-install it before removal to make sure you're as close to official package selection as possible.)

If you are upgrading {{gateway_product_name}}...

<pre>
apt-get install whonix-gateway
</pre>

If you are upgrading Whonix-Workstation...
<pre>
apt-get install whonix-workstation
</pre>

Get rid of old packages.

<pre>
apt-get autoremove
</pre>

Remember to store the terminal (Konsole) log. (File -> Save Output As)

Reboot required.

<pre>
reboot
</pre>
