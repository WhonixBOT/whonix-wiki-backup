|description={{project name}} Relationship with Upstream Projects.
}}
= Summary =

For various reasons {{project name}} tries to diverge by the smallest possible amount from its upstream projects, and especially from Debian:

* wants to share his work with the rest of the Free Software community.
* values maintainability very much: believe users are best served if keep the amount of work needed to maintain {{project name}} the smallest possible.
* [https://forums.whonix.org/t/focus-on-low-effort-maintainability/9067 Focus on low-effort maintainability]

= How =

== Debian specific ==

=== Derivatives Census ===

[http://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Census/{{project_name_short}} {{project name}} participates in the Derivatives Census.]

=== Infrastructure ===

Debian Derivatives Guidelines recommends ''"We encourage derivative distributions to use Debian infrastructure and the software that powers Debian infrastructure where possible."''.

{{project_name}} makes heavy use of that. Only official Debian repositories are used. {{project name}} is very thankful, that Debian derivatives are allowed to do so. The {{project name}} project has neither the infrastructure, the founding nor the manpower to run its own repositories.

=== Debian packages ===

Neither binary nor source packages are modified.

Any configuration file modifications of any packages sourced from packages.debian.org which derivate from the default package configuration is implemented through {{proejct name}} packages.

=== Keyrings ===

{{project_name}} does not modify keyrings.

Patrick's OpenPGP key is copied into {{project name}} virtual machines at build time. It is only used to ensure authenticity of {{project name}} APT repository.

=== Releases ===

See [[Dev/Operating_System#Why is Whonix â„¢ based on Debian Stable, not Debian Testing?|About Debian]] for reasons to choose stable.

=== Trademark ===

{{project_name}} is and will never be called Debian. It must always be clear that {{project name}} is a Debian derivative or based on Debian.

Patrick Schleizer e-mailed trademark at debian.org and briefly explained {{project_name}}. Debian Leader Stefano Zacchiroli said, there will be no trademark issues as long as {{project name}} will not claim to be Debian, which will of course never happen.

See also [[{{project name short}} Trademark Policy|{{project_name}} Trademark Policy]].

=== De-/Re-branding ===

Not necessary. See Trademark above.

=== Bug reports ===

Reportbug is unchanged. No Debian packages are modified.

=== Popularity Contest ===

Not installed in {{project_name}}. Reasons are in the [[Operating System#Popularity Contest|Popularity Contest]] chapter.

== General ==

=== Upstream software ===

When technical skills and time allows, changes are pushed upstream when we need to modify software shipped. Only package selection, configuration files and scripts are modified.

=== Upstream Bug tracking systems ===

All bugs found in {{project_name}}, will be checked, if they also apply to upstream. If that is the case, the plan is to check if bug has already been reported. If there is something constructive to contribute, it will be done. In case there is not yet a bug report, one will be submitted.

The same goes for wishlist/enhancement requests.

= Why this document? =

The [https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Guidelines Debian Derivatives Guidelines] encourages "derivative distributions to mention and define their relationship with Debian". Because this seems like a great idea, this statement that not only covers {{project name}} relationship with Debian, but also {{project name}} relationship with any one of its upstream projects.
