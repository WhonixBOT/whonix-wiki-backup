The greatest security benefit comes from applying full disk encryption [[Full Disk Encryption|on the host]] because that is the only place where it is most effective. Nevertheless, for the interested reader this section makes recommendations to deal with the following threat model:

* The host is running when an adversary gets access to it, or the host is unencrypted.
* The VM is powered down (otherwise the adversary would already have access to it).

{{Code2|The following security considerations are based on modified quotes by [http://security.stackexchange.com/users/953/iszi Iszi] from the answer posted on [http://security.stackexchange.com/a/29538 security.stackexchange.com], which was a user contribution to stackexchange, licensed under [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ cc by-sa 3.0] with [https://blog.stackexchange.com/2009/06/attribution-required/ attribution required].}}

== Full Disk Encryption within the Virtual Machine ==

When using FDE within the VM, never save (suspend/pause) the VM machine state, but instead shut it down completely. If this advice is ignored, the saved machine state could be stored outside of the encrypted image. This includes a RAM dump, which contains the encryption key required to decrypt the image. Upon resuming the VM, that stored file is not necessarily securely deleted, since it is virtualizer-specific. <ref>In the case of [[VirtualBox]], the file could end up in the folder {{Code2|~/.virtualbox}}. A definitive answer requires further research.</ref>

While the VM is running, users should not use the host system's sleep, suspend, or hibernate functions. Similar to the first scenario, these actions leave a RAM dump on disk, but this time it belongs to the host. This also contains sensitive data, such as encryption keys.

== Virtual Machine Files in an Encrypted Container ==

VM files can also be stored in an encrypted container, such as a LUKS container. Newer and native support for LUKS encryption of disk images is available as of libvirt 2.10 <ref>https://libvirt.org/formatstorageencryption.html#StorageEncryptionLuks</ref>
The same precautions should be taken as outlined in the previous section, as the risks equally apply.

FDE within the VM, LUKS encrypted containers for VM images, and FDE on the host can all be used independently, or in conjunction. However, increasing the layers of encryption may begin to significantly degrade performance. {{Code2|End modified quote by Iszi.}}

== Other Security Considerations ==

Encryption is an area with many pitfalls. The user should also consider the following:

* '''Memory Dumps:''' These are caused by BSOD or kernel crashes, and can leave unintended traces on the host. See [[Core Dumps]].
* '''Powered-down VMs:''' After a VM has shutdown, the RAM that previously contained the VM's encryption key might not have been wiped yet. Memory pages belonging to a terminated process do not have their contents wiped (zeroed) until they are about to be used by another process. <ref>
https://security.stackexchange.com/a/42186 <blockquote>Linux zeroes out (i.e. fills with zeros) all pages of memory not when they are released, but when they are given to another process. Thus, no process may obtain data excerpts from another process. However, the pages will retain their old contents until they are reused.</blockquote>
</ref> <ref>https://superuser.com/a/894936</ref> <ref>https://askubuntu.com/a/721207</ref> <ref>The threat is similar to [[#Cold Boot Attacks|cold boot attacks]], but in this case it might even be a "warm" attack, because under this threat model, the machine and RAM is still powered. [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Grsecurity/Appendix/Grsecurity_and_PaX_Configuration_Options#Sanitize_all_freed_memory PAX_MEMORY_SANITIZE] and its [https://github.com/thestinger/linux-hardened/wiki#sanitize-all-freed-memory KSPP successor] may mitigate this, but at the cost of a non-trivial performance hit.</ref>
* '''Swap:''' An encrypted swap provides no protection so  long as the host is powered up, because the key is still in RAM.
** <u>Disabling Swap:</u> This action requires a special, secure wiping of the existing swap. It is safer to have never used swap before.
* Virtualizer specific:
** '''KVM:''' It is not ''expected'' that KVM guests could access data from other process' memory pages via [https://www.techopedia.com/definition/30466/memory-ballooning memory ballooning], since KVM guests are Linux processes and subject to Linux memory allocation rules. <ref>https://www.techopedia.com/definition/30466/memory-ballooning <blockquote>Memory ballooning is a memory management feature used in most virtualization platforms which allows a host system to artificially enlarge its pool of memory by taking advantage or reclaiming unused memory previously allocated to various virtual machines.</blockquote></ref>
** '''Xen:''' Memory ballooning in Xen creates privacy concerns because when it is enabled the memory contents of other VMs are exposed. <ref>https://docs.openstack.org/security-guide/tenant-data/data-privacy-concerns.html <blockquote>Xen explicitly assigns dedicated memory regions to instances and scrubs data upon the destruction of instances (or domains in Xen parlance). KVM depends more greatly on Linux page management; A complex set of rules related to KVM paging is defined in the KVM documentation. It is important to note that use of the Xen memory balloon feature is likely to result in information disclosure. We strongly recommended to avoid use of this feature.</blockquote></ref>

The host of security considerations suggest that an unrealistic set of operational rules are required to defend the integrity of a purely encrypted guest image, without host FDE.

== Open Security Research Questions ==

The following questions and configurations require further research:

* With swap and crash dumps disabled, it is unknown whether the virtualizer writes parts of the VM's RAM contents to the disk. TODO: Specifically ask virtualizer vendors about this possibility.
* Potential setup configurations:
** Theoretically, a fully encrypted operating system (currently: Debian) could be installed inside a VM and Whonix could be built using <code>--target root</code> inside another VM. This is analogous to the [[Dev/Build_Documentation/Physical_Isolation|physical isolation]] model, but secure VM settings would be missing (similar to [[Manually Create Whonix VM Settings]]).
** An encryption feature could be added to [https://grml.org/grml-debootstrap/ <code>grml-debootstrap</code>] <ref>
* https://github.com/grml/grml-debootstrap
* https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=grml-debootstrap
</ref> <ref>
[https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/build-steps.d/1300_create-raw-image Whonix build script is a user] of <code>grml-debootstrap</code>.
</ref> and/or the Whonix build script. There was an  [https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-container-encryption-options/193 attempt] to do that, but this effort has stalled.
** cryptsetup-reencrypt could be used, allowing for the shipping of encrypted Whonix images. The master key and the password (potentially blank) would be known to the public at first. Later, users would use cryptsetup-reencrypt to fix the master key and password, that is, to make the encryption effective.
