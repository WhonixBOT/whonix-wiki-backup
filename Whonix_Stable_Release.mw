= {{project_name}} 15 Changelog =

{{project_name}} 15 was released on July 1, 2019. <ref>Some fixes/changes were implemented in both {{project_name}} 14 and 15.</ref> Significantly, {{project_name}} 15 is based on the Debian buster (Debian 10) distribution which was officially released on July 6, 2019 instead of Debian stretch (Debian 9). The buster release has nearly 60,000 packages and over 62 per cent of them were updated <ref>https://www.debian.org/News/2019/20190706</ref> <ref>More than 91 per cent of the source packages included in Debian 10 are reproducible (will build bit-for-bit identical binary packages).</ref>  -- see the [https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/releasenotes official Debian 10 release notes] to learn more. 

== All Platforms ==

=== Bug Fixes ===

* Fixed file saving issues in scurl wrappers. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T899</ref> <ref>https://github.com/Whonix/scurl/pull/1</ref> <ref>A few fixes were needed, such as:
* Remove <code>--remote-name</code> and replace it with <code>--remote-name-all</code>.
* Improve download wrappers and add <code>--remote-header-name</code>.</ref>
* Fixed the partial truncation of text in Whonix Connection Wizard. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T923</ref>
* Installed cryptsetup by default so errors do not appear when using a GUI and interacting with encrypted containers. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T890</ref> <ref>For instance, an error would otherwise appear when using XFCE file manager with encrypted USBs.</ref> <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/have-cryptsetup-installed-by-default-in-whonix/6684/5</ref>

=== Builds ===

* Ported the build script to cowbuilder; build packages in chroot and use mmdebstrap for better security. <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/fixed-apt-rce-announced-new-whonix-images-needed-whonix-build-not-safe-at-the-moment/6715</ref>

=== Code ===

* Modified whonixcheck so it suggests to start networking / onion-grater if it is not running. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T853</ref>
* Improved the /usr/share/sdwdate/unit_test <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T712</ref> <ref>Specifically:
* Make it simpler (to split urls into chunks of 3).

* Added the [https://packages.debian.org/buster/mat2 Metadata anonymisation toolkit v2 (MAT2)] by default. <ref><blockquote>MAT2 only removes metadata from your files, it does not anonymise their content, nor can it handle watermarking, steganography, or any too custom metadata field/system.</blockquote></ref> <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T885</ref> <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/add-mat2-to-whonix-15/6489</ref>
* Added a LUKS container GUI ([https://packages.debian.org/buster/zulucrypt-gui zulucrypt-gui]) <ref>[https://packages.debian.org/buster/zulumount-gui zulumount-gui] is also installed.</ref> by default to make management and creation of containers easy. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T769</ref> <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/zulucrypt-in-whonix-14/4876</ref>
* [[OnionShare]] is now installed by default for easier, anonymous sharing of files. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T595</ref> <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/feature-request-onionshare-support/300/7?u=patrick</ref>
* Added [https://packages.debian.org/buster/keepassxc KeePassXC] as the default Password Manager in Whonix-Workstation. <ref>https://github.com/Whonix/anon-meta-packages/commit/8d5e892d3b603bb1390d3c152f70f8b8e8bfefef</ref>
* Removed the [https://packages.debian.org/buster/ricochet-im Richochet instant messaging application] since it is no longer working in {{project_name}} 15. <ref>Primarily due to incompatibility with v3 onions.</ref> <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/remove-ricochet-from-whonix/5009</ref>
* [https://packages.debian.org/buster/nyx Nyx] has replaced tor-arm as the Tor controller, providing (slightly) better functionality and usability. <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/what-about-nyx/6380</ref> <ref>nyx is actually the same project; just the name has changed and the presentation is very similar.</ref>
* Set VLC X11 video decoding by default so it works more reliably and avoids known problems. <ref>http://phabricator.whonix.org/T798</ref>

=== Security Enhancements ===

* The [https://packages.debian.org/buster/jitterentropy-rngd Jitter RNG Daemon (jitterentropy)] is now installed by default to improve randomness if entropy on the system runs low. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T817</ref> <ref><blockquote> Using the Jitter RNG core, the rngd provides an entropy source that feeds into the Linux /dev/random device if its entropy runs low. ... Especially during boot time, when the entropy of Linux is low, the Jitter RNGd provides a source of sufficient entropy.</blockquote></ref>

=== Security Enhancements ===

* Disabled boot devices and modified audio settings in VirtualBox Workstation and Gateway to improve security. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T782</ref> <ref>The floppy and optical settings were disabled in both the Gateway and Workstation, while the Gateway audio was also disabled.</ref>
* [https://github.com/Whonix/kloak Forked] the [https://github.com/vmonaco/kloak kloak - Keystroke Anonymization Tool] and installed it by default in {{non_q_project_name_short}}. <ref><blockquote>kloak is a privacy tool that makes keystroke biometrics less effective. This is accomplished by obfuscating the time intervals between key press and release events, which are typically used for identification. This project is experimental.</blockquote></ref> <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/kloak-keystroke-anonymization-tool/7089</ref>
* Improved the default kernel hardening options for better security. <ref>See recent pull requests [https://github.com/Whonix/security-misc here].</ref> <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/kernel-hardening/7296/9</ref> <ref>The specific changes include: <blockquote>
Kernel symbols in /proc/kallsyms are hidden to prevent malware from reading them and using them to learn more about what to attack on your system.

Kexec is disabled as it can be used for live patching of the running kernel.

The BPF JIT compiler is restricted to the root user and is hardened.

ASLR effectiveness for mmap is increased.

The ptrace system call is restricted to the root user only.

The TCP/IP stack is hardened.

This package makes some data spoofing attacks harder.

SACK is disabled as it is commonly exploited and is rarely used.

This package disables the merging of slabs of similar sizes to prevent an attacker from exploiting them.

Sanity checks, redzoning, and memory poisoning are enabled.

The kernel now panics on uncorrectable errors in ECC memory which could be exploited.

Kernel Page Table Isolation is enabled to mitigate Meltdown and increase KASLR effectiveness.

SMT is disabled as it can be used to exploit the MDS vulnerability.

All mitigations for the MDS vulnerability are enabled.

DCCP, SCTP, TIPC and RDS are blacklisted as they are rarely used and may have unknown vulnerabilities.</blockquote></ref>

== {{q_project_name}} ==

=== Bug Fixes ===

* Correctly configured {{q_project_name}} XFCE default start menu entries (whitelisted appmenus). <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T883</ref>

=== Builds ===

* Created Qubes-Whonix 15 template configuration files. <ref>https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-template-configs/pull/6/commits/d4f429669b849fc73973e2e557a24cceab47c45e</ref> <ref>https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-builder/pull/82/commits/64a661241430c6a22ca98bb11370b2a3e3cf0e12</ref>
* Confirmed the Whonix-15-gateway template builds. <ref>https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/4957</ref>

=== Improved Functionality and Usability ===

* Simplified instructions for [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/managing-vm-kernel/#using-kernel-installed-in-the-vm VM kernel] in {{q_project_name}} by installing the same recommended Qubes packages as Qubes Debian packages. <ref>https://github.com/Whonix/qubes-whonix/commit/8d8ab41bbf9c7fa63f3e79b8511d439efe33caeb</ref> <ref>https://github.com/Whonix/qubes-whonix/commit/c08dfed97cfba369ff753b4d96755b47240fffb2</ref>
* In DisposableVMs, tb-updater / tb-starter was modified to no longer copy Tor Browser to the user home directory at first boot -- /var/cache/tb-binary is now directly used to improve startup performance. <ref>https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/4918</ref> <ref>Neither are backups of Tor Browser maintained anymore; previously three backups were stored.</ref>

=== Security Enhancements ===

* Confirmed {{q_project_name}} TemplateMVs cannot upgrade in timesync-fail-closed mode. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T858</ref> <ref>timesync-fail-closed means sdwdate did not succeed yet. Networking for all but Tor and sdwdate should still be locked in this scenario.</ref>

** Fixed and actually use <code>--no-create-home</code>.

=== Documentation ===

* Documented how to use [[Recovery|recovery mode]].
* Created detailed [[Dev/Whonix_Networking|Whonix Networking Implementation Documentation]] which documents the differences with Debian networking. <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-networking-implementation-developer-documentation-feedback-wanted/8274</ref>

=== Improved Functionality and Usability ===

* Disabled whonixcheck “Connecting to Tor…” and “Connected to Tor.” messages. <ref>In favor of sdwdate-gui. whonixcheck connectivity check code checks Tor as well as sdwdate. Due to slow Tor/onion speed it often times out. Improving that code is difficult, so sdwdate-gui is used instead as a solution that provides better visual feedback to users.</ref>
* Added support for OnionShare “bundled Tor”.
* Packaged str_replace for literal search and replace functions.
* Display the pulseaudio plugin by default.
* Added arc-theme, gnome-themes-extra, gnome-themes-extra-data and gtk2-engines-murrine for better visual presentation and a more modern look.
* Set SUDO_EDITOR="mousepad" if: mousepad is installed and the environment variable SUDO_EDITOR has not already been set.
* Updated Tor Browser to version 9.
* The Whonix build script now optionally supports installing packages from the Whonix remote repository, rather than building packages locally. <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-build-script-now-optionally-supports-installing-packages-from-whonix-remote-repository-rather-than-building-packages-locally/8107</ref> 
* Simplified the default sudo lecture (presenting text upon first run) so it only shows the default password for Whonix. <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/disable-or-change-sudo-lecture-at-frist-run-we-trust-you-have-received-the-usual-lecture-from-the-local-system-administrator-it-usually-boils-down-to-these-three-things/8323</ref> <ref>https://github.com/Whonix/anon-base-files/commit/a929f1c438a9ac2a7cc01926e30b8d210debe442</ref> <ref>https://github.com/Whonix/anon-base-files/blob/master/usr/share/derivative-base-files/sudo-default-password-lecture</ref>
* Removed the deprecated obfs3 bridges option from Anon Connection Wizard.
* Enabled serial console functionality in VirtualBox, see: [[Recovery#Serial_Console|Serial Console]]. <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/serial-console-in-virtualbox/8021</ref> <ref>This helps for recovery efforts and simplifies setting up the kernel boot parameters inside the VM.</ref>
* From the VirtualBox host, simplify the sending of SysRq commands to VirtualBox VMs using the <code>vboxmanage</code> command. <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/send-sysrq-commands-to-virtualbox-usability-helper-virtualbox-send-sysrq/8369</ref>

=== Kernel Hardening ===

Significant [https://forums.whonix.org/t/kernel-hardening/7296/140 kernel] and other security hardening has been implemented; numerous enhancements have been made to [https://github.com/Whonix/security-misc security-misc]:
* Enabled kernel panic on kernel oops after boot, see: [https://forums.whonix.org/t/set-oops-panic-kernel-parameter-or-kernel-panic-on-oops-1-sysctl-for-better-security/7713 set oops=panic kernel parameter or kernel.panic_on_oops=1 sysctl for better security].
* Enabled pam_umask.so usergroups, so group permissions are the same as user permissions. <ref>By default, Debian utilizes [https://wiki.debian.org/UserPrivateGroups User Private Groups (UPG)]. Also see: /usr/share/pam-configs/usergroups-security-misc</ref>
* Removed read, write and execute access for others for all users who have home folders under folder /home. <ref>For example, this affects those running “chmod o-rwx /home/user” during package installation or an upgrade.</ref> <ref>This is only performed once for each folder in the parent /home folder, so users who wish to relax file permissions can do so. This action protects files in the user's home folder which were previously created with lax file permissions prior to the installation of this package.</ref>
* Group sudo membership is required to use <code>su</code>.
* [[Root#Passwordless_Recovery_Mode_Security_Discussion|Passwordless]], [[Recovery|recovery / emergency mode]] has been implemented.
* Lock user accounts with pam_tally2 after five failed authentication attempts are detected. <ref>See: [[Recovery#Unlock_User_Account:_Excessive_Wrong_Password_Entry_Attempts|unlock instructions]]. This means it is possible to have short, easy-to-remember, "weak" passwords for the user <code>user</code> account, while still preventing compromised non-root users from bruteforcing it.</ref>
* The thunderbolt and firewire modules were blacklisted, since they can be used for Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks.
* Every module must now be signed before being loaded; any module that is unsigned or signed with an invalid key cannot be loaded. <ref>This makes it harder to load a malicious module.</ref>
* Uncommon network protocols were blacklisted: these are rarely used and may have unknown vulnerabilities. <ref>See: /etc/modprobe.d/uncommon-network-protocols.conf</ref>
* Enabled [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input-output_memory_management_unit IOMMU].
* The SysRq key is restricted to only allow shutdowns/reboots.
* A systemd service mounts /proc with <code>hidepid=2</code> at boot, thereby preventing users from seeing each other’s processes.
* A systemd service clears System.map on boot as these contain kernel symbols that could be useful to an attacker. <ref>[https://forums.whonix.org/t/kernel-hardening/7296/130 Forum discussion].</ref>
* Remove System.map after a kernel upgrade.
* The kernel logs are restricted to root only.
* The BPF JIT compiler is restricted to the root user and is hardened.
* The ptrace system call is restricted to the root user only.
* Added user <code>root</code> to group sudo. This is necessary so it is still possible to login as a user in a virtual console. <ref>See: debian/security-misc.postinst</ref>
* Kernel symbols in ''/proc/kallsyms'' are hidden. This prevents malware from reading and using them to learn more about system vulnerabilities that can be attacked.
* Kexec is disabled because it can be used for live patching of the running kernel.
* Bluetooth is blacklisted to reduce the attack surface.
* For a full list of changes, see: https://github.com/Whonix/security-misc

=== KVM ===

* Command line control of KVM VMs is now supported. <ref>See: [[KVM#Command_Line_Interface_.28CLI.29|KVM Command Line Interface (CLI)]]</ref>
* The microphone is disabled by default.
* Switched RNG to ''/dev/urandom''
* pvspinlock is enabled.
* Fixed Whonix-Gateway firewall desktop shortcuts.
* No longer install <code>pulseaudio</code> by default on Whonix-Gateway.
* Various apparmor fixes.
* Created new apparmor profiles for bootclockrandomization, permission lockdown, and pam tally2 information.
* Ensured future compatibility for apparmor-profile-everything.
* Improved the output of remove system.map
* Fixed the KVM prepare_release script.
* Fixed the GPU tag in libvirt XML.
* Updated Tor Browser to version 9.0.1

=== Security Enhancements ===

Much stronger Linux user account isolation has been enforced in non-Qubes-Whonix: <ref>This does not yet apply to Qubes-Whonix.</ref>
* Locked and expired the root account in new Whonix builds. Existing users who upgraded are [[Root|advised]] to lock their root account. <ref>[https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/2695 Qubes issue].</ref>
* Disabled root login in [[Desktop#Virtual_Consoles|virtual consoles]] by default. <ref>This is a purposeful security feature and there are no user freedom restrictions; read more [[Root|here]].</ref>
* Added a [https://forums.whonix.org/t/add-tor-browser-first-startup-popup-to-ask-whether-security-slider-should-be-set-to-safest/7591 Tor Browser first startup popup] to ask whether the security slider should be set to safest.
* [https://forums.whonix.org/t/anonymize-etc-machine-id/7721 Anonymized /etc/machine-id].
* anon-gpg-tweaks: disabled keyservers for improved security. <ref>See: [https://forums.whonix.org/t/gpg-recv-keys-fails-no-longer-use-keyservers-for-anything/5607 gpg --recv-keys fails / no longer use keyservers for anything].</ref>
* Enabled [https://www.debian.org/releases/buster/amd64/release-notes/ch-whats-new.en.html#apt-sandboxing APT seccomp sandboxing].
* Added more seccomp hardening.
* Enforced [https://forums.whonix.org/t/msgcollector-security-hardening/7625 msgcollector security (mount option) hardening].
* Implemented systemd unit file hardening of services maintained by Whonix.
* Tor Browser Starter (tb-starter Whonix package) hardening: implemented optional <code>--hardening / tb_hardening="true"</code> which utilizes Firejail and/or Hardened Malloc, see: [[Tor_Browser#Hardening|Tor Browser Hardening documentation]].
* Installed [https://forums.whonix.org/t/hardened-malloc/7474 Hardened Malloc] by default to ease usage (although it is not enabled by default to avoid breakage).
* Upgraded Hardened Malloc to version 2 and switched to compile with clang rather than gcc as per upstream preference.
* <code>sudoedit</code> is now used in Whonix software and documentation (rather than the <code>lxqtsudo</code> editor) for better security. <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/use-sudoedit-in-whonix-documentation-and-whonix-software/7599</ref> <ref>Running any editor as root is insecure. <code>sudoedit</code> copies the file to a temporary location, edits it as a normal user and then overwrites the original using <code>sudo</code>.</ref>
* Created an opt-in feature to restrict hardware information to root, see: [[Whonix-Workstation_Security_Hardening#Restrict_Hardware_Information_to_Root|Restrict Hardware Information to Root]]. <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/restrict-hardware-information-to-root/7329/2</ref>
