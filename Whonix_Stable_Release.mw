= {{project_name}} 15 Changelog =

{{project_name}} 15 was released on July 1, 2019. <ref>Some fixes/changes were implemented in both {{project_name}} 14 and 15.</ref> Significantly, {{project_name}} 15 is based on the Debian buster (Debian 10) distribution which was officially released on July 6, 2019 instead of Debian stretch (Debian 9). The buster release has nearly 60,000 packages and over 62 per cent of them were updated <ref>https://www.debian.org/News/2019/20190706</ref> <ref>More than 91 per cent of the source packages included in Debian 10 are reproducible (will build bit-for-bit identical binary packages).</ref>  -- see the [https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/releasenotes official Debian 10 release notes] to learn more.

* [https://github.com/Whonix/kloak Forked] the [https://github.com/vmonaco/kloak kloak - Keystroke Anonymization Tool] and installed it by default in {{non_q_project_name_short}}. <ref><blockquote>kloak is a privacy tool that makes keystroke biometrics less effective. This is accomplished by obfuscating the time intervals between key press and release events, which are typically used for identification. This project is experimental.</blockquote></ref> <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/kloak-keystroke-anonymization-tool/7089</ref>
* Improved the default kernel hardening options for better security. <ref>See recent pull requests [https://github.com/Whonix/security-misc here].</ref> <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/kernel-hardening/7296/9</ref> <ref>The specific changes include: <blockquote>
Kernel symbols in /proc/kallsyms are hidden to prevent malware from reading them and using them to learn more about what to attack on your system.

Kexec is disabled as it can be used for live patching of the running kernel.

The BPF JIT compiler is restricted to the root user and is hardened.

ASLR effectiveness for mmap is increased.

The ptrace system call is restricted to the root user only.

The TCP/IP stack is hardened.

This package makes some data spoofing attacks harder.

SACK is disabled as it is commonly exploited and is rarely used.

This package disables the merging of slabs of similar sizes to prevent an attacker from exploiting them.

Sanity checks, redzoning, and memory poisoning are enabled.

The kernel now panics on uncorrectable errors in ECC memory which could be exploited.

Kernel Page Table Isolation is enabled to mitigate Meltdown and increase KASLR effectiveness.

SMT is disabled as it can be used to exploit the MDS vulnerability.

All mitigations for the MDS vulnerability are enabled.

DCCP, SCTP, TIPC and RDS are blacklisted as they are rarely used and may have unknown vulnerabilities.</blockquote></ref>

== {{q_project_name}} ==

=== Bug Fixes ===

* Correctly configured {{q_project_name}} XFCE default start menu entries (whitelisted appmenus). <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T883</ref>

=== Builds ===

* Created Qubes-Whonix 15 template configuration files. <ref>https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-template-configs/pull/6/commits/d4f429669b849fc73973e2e557a24cceab47c45e</ref> <ref>https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-builder/pull/82/commits/64a661241430c6a22ca98bb11370b2a3e3cf0e12</ref>
* Confirmed the Whonix-15-gateway template builds. <ref>https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/4957</ref>

=== Improved Functionality and Usability ===

* Simplified instructions for [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/managing-vm-kernel/#using-kernel-installed-in-the-vm VM kernel] in {{q_project_name}} by installing the same recommended Qubes packages as Qubes Debian packages. <ref>https://github.com/Whonix/qubes-whonix/commit/8d8ab41bbf9c7fa63f3e79b8511d439efe33caeb</ref> <ref>https://github.com/Whonix/qubes-whonix/commit/c08dfed97cfba369ff753b4d96755b47240fffb2</ref>
* In DisposableVMs, tb-updater / tb-starter was modified to no longer copy Tor Browser to the user home directory at first boot -- /var/cache/tb-binary is now directly used to improve startup performance. <ref>https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/4918</ref> <ref>Neither are backups of Tor Browser maintained anymore; previously three backups were stored.</ref>

=== Security Enhancements ===

* Confirmed {{q_project_name}} TemplateMVs cannot upgrade in timesync-fail-closed mode. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T858</ref> <ref>timesync-fail-closed means sdwdate did not succeed yet. Networking for all but Tor and sdwdate should still be locked in this scenario.</ref>

=== Kernel and Related Hardening ===

Significant [https://forums.whonix.org/t/kernel-hardening/7296/140 kernel] and other security hardening has been implemented; numerous enhancements have been made to [https://github.com/Whonix/security-misc security-misc]: <ref>https://github.com/Whonix/security-misc/compare/a99dfd067ac8a43bdcd779cf57b3533bdaa404fb...163e20b886f298cb9d3aca54c14f66991001b396</ref>

* Enabled <code>pam_umask.so</code> usergroups, so group permissions are the same as user permissions. <ref>By default, Debian utilizes [https://wiki.debian.org/UserPrivateGroups User Private Groups (UPG)]. Also see: <code>/usr/share/pam-configs/usergroups-security-misc</code></ref>
* Removed read, write and execute access for others for all users who have home folders under folder /home. <ref>For example, this affects those running “chmod o-rwx /home/user” during package installation or an upgrade.</ref> <ref>This is only performed once for each folder in the parent /home folder, so users who wish to relax file permissions can do so. This action protects files in the user's home folder which were previously created with lax file permissions prior to the installation of this package.</ref>
* Group sudo membership is required to use <code>su</code>.
* [[Root#Passwordless_Recovery_Mode_Security_Discussion|Passwordless]], [[Recovery|recovery / emergency mode]] has been implemented.
* Lock user accounts with <code>pam_tally2</code> after five failed authentication attempts are detected. <ref>See: [[Recovery#Unlock_User_Account:_Excessive_Wrong_Password_Entry_Attempts|unlock instructions]]. This means it is possible to have short, easy-to-remember, "weak" passwords for the user <code>user</code> account, while still preventing compromised non-root users from bruteforcing it.</ref>
* Fix <code>pam_tally2</code> check when read-only disk boots without ro-mode-init or grub-live.
* The thunderbolt and firewire modules were blacklisted, since they can be used for Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks.
* Every module must now be signed before being loaded; any module that is unsigned or signed with an invalid key cannot be loaded. <ref>This makes it harder to load a malicious module.</ref>
* Uncommon network protocols were blacklisted: these are rarely used and may have unknown vulnerabilities. <ref>See: /etc/modprobe.d/uncommon-network-protocols.conf</ref>
* Enabled [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input-output_memory_management_unit IOMMU].
* The SysRq key is restricted to only allow shutdowns/reboots.
* [https://forums.whonix.org/t/sysrq-magic-sysrq-key/8079 Restrict] the [[SysRq]] key so it can only be used for shutdowns and the Secure Attention Key.
* A systemd service mounts /proc with <code>hidepid=2</code> at boot, thereby preventing users from seeing each other’s processes.
* A systemd service clears System.map on boot as these contain kernel symbols that could be useful to an attacker. <ref>[https://forums.whonix.org/t/kernel-hardening/7296/130 Forum discussion].</ref>
* Remove System.map after a kernel upgrade.
* remove-system-map: use shred instead of rm.
* The kernel logs are restricted to root only.
* The BPF JIT compiler is restricted to the root user and is hardened.
* The ptrace system call is restricted to the root user only.
* Added user <code>root</code> to group sudo. This is necessary so it is still possible to login as a user in a virtual console. <ref>See: debian/security-misc.postinst</ref>
* Kernel symbols in <code>/proc/kallsyms</code> are hidden. This prevents malware from reading and using them to learn more about system vulnerabilities that can be attacked.
* Kexec is disabled because it can be used for live patching of the running kernel.
* Bluetooth is blacklisted to reduce the attack surface.

* The MSR kernel module is blacklisted to prevent CPU MSRs from being abused to write to arbitrary memory.
* Vsyscalls are disabled as they are obsolete, are at fixed addresses and are a target for ROP.
* Page allocator freelist randomization is enabled.
* The vivid kernel module is blacklisted as it is only required for testing and has been the cause of multiple vulnerabilities.
* An initramfs hook sets the sysctl values in <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> and <code>/etc/sysctl.d</code> before init is executed so sysctl hardening is enabled as early as possible.
* The kernel panics on oopses to prevent it from continuing to run a flawed process and to deter brute forcing.

=== Security Enhancements ===

Much stronger Linux user account isolation has been enforced in {{non_q_project_name}}: <ref>This does not yet apply to Qubes-Whonix.</ref>
* Locked and expired the root account in new Whonix builds. Existing users who upgraded are [[Root|advised]] to lock their root account. <ref>[https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/2695 Qubes issue].</ref>
* Disabled root login in [[Desktop#Virtual_Consoles|virtual consoles]] by default. <ref>This is a purposeful security feature and there are no user freedom restrictions; read more [[Root|here]].</ref>
* Added a [https://forums.whonix.org/t/add-tor-browser-first-startup-popup-to-ask-whether-security-slider-should-be-set-to-safest/7591 Tor Browser first startup popup] to ask whether the security slider should be set to safest -- this was disabled in a later release due to broken functionality.
* [https://forums.whonix.org/t/anonymize-etc-machine-id/7721 Anonymized /etc/machine-id].
* anon-gpg-tweaks: disabled keyservers for improved security. <ref>See: [https://forums.whonix.org/t/gpg-recv-keys-fails-no-longer-use-keyservers-for-anything/5607 gpg --recv-keys fails / no longer use keyservers for anything].</ref>
* Enabled [https://www.debian.org/releases/buster/amd64/release-notes/ch-whats-new.en.html#apt-sandboxing APT seccomp sandboxing].
* Added more seccomp hardening.
* Enforced [https://forums.whonix.org/t/msgcollector-security-hardening/7625 msgcollector security (mount option) hardening].
* Implemented systemd unit file hardening of services maintained by Whonix.
* Tor Browser Starter (tb-starter Whonix package) hardening: implemented optional <code>--hardening / tb_hardening="true"</code> which utilizes Firejail and/or Hardened Malloc, see: [[Tor_Browser#Hardening|Tor Browser Hardening documentation]].
* Installed [https://forums.whonix.org/t/hardened-malloc/7474 Hardened Malloc] by default to ease usage (although it is not enabled by default to avoid breakage).
* Upgraded Hardened Malloc to version 2 and switched to compile with clang rather than gcc as per upstream preference.
* <code>sudoedit</code> is now used in Whonix software and documentation (rather than the <code>lxqtsudo</code> editor) for better security. <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/use-sudoedit-in-whonix-documentation-and-whonix-software/7599</ref> <ref>Running any editor as root is insecure. <code>sudoedit</code> copies the file to a temporary location, edits it as a normal user and then overwrites the original using <code>sudo</code>.</ref>
* Created an opt-in feature to restrict hardware information to root, see: [[Whonix-Workstation_Security_Hardening#Restrict_Hardware_Information_to_Root|Restrict Hardware Information to Root]]. <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/restrict-hardware-information-to-root/7329/2</ref>

Added [https://github.com/mikeperry-tor/vanguards vanguards] to protect against guard discovery and related traffic analysis attacks: <ref>[https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8516 CVE-2020-8516 Hidden Service deanonymization]</ref> <ref>[https://github.com/Whonix/anon-gw-anonymizer-config/compare/0858b072659ce4a375ba9b08b84da3d45300336a...40c48fc0414828f48c5ff9465d839458c8b35b25 enable vanguards by default]</ref> <ref>[https://github.com/Whonix/anon-meta-packages/compare/a69156fc964e0410443b89430b48c255cefc652d...7ae0f0e054f9cac9496978658fcb97b035f48ee0 install by default]</ref>
* The daemon in Tor through 0.4.1.8 and 0.4.2.x through 0.4.2.6 does not verify that a rendezvous node is known before attempting to connect to it, which might make it easier for remote attackers to discover circuit information -- [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2020-February/014157.html vanguards fixes this].
* Use [https://packages.debian.org/buster/vanguards vanguards from packages.debian.org]
* Ensured vanguards do not start in a TemplateVM in Qubes-Whonix.

Eased installation of [[Linux_Kernel_Runtime_Guard_LKRG|Linux Kernel Runtime Guard (LKRG)]] for users of {{non_q_project_name}}, Kicksecure and Debian hosts -- <code>sudo apt install lkrg</code>: <ref>Also available in Qubes OS Debian templates and Qubes-Whonix with use of an in-VM kernel.</ref> <ref>LKRG will likely be installed by default in Whonix and Kicksecure in one of the next stable releases.</ref>
* Improves overall system security and is compatible with tirdad.
* Hardens kernel security by killing whole classes of exploits, detecting exploits and performing Linux kernel runtime integrity checking.
* Worked with LKRG upstream to fix LKRG VirtualBox host support.
* Packaging enhancements were incorporated, so any standard Debian build tool can be used. <ref>This is quick and easy. For example: “dpkg-buildpackage -b”</ref>
* Disabled the “System is clean!” message to avoid spamming dmesg and tty1.
* [https://forums.whonix.org/t/dkms-kernel-modules-lkrg-and-tirdad-fail-to-properly-recompile-on-kernel-upgrade/8931 Fixed] compilation using DKMS on kernel upgrade by adding support for make variable KERNELRELEASE (DKMS sets it).
* Auto-load LKRG after installation. <ref>Since LKRG now supports module parameters and [https://www.openwall.com/lists/lkrg-users/2020/01/25/2 VirtualBox host support], it can be automatically started after installation since it would no longer kill VirtualBox VMs running on a host.</ref>
* Upgraded LKRG to the latest upstream version (version <code>0.8.1</code>; although not yet installed by default).

Other security enhancements:

* Prevented verbose output during boot to prevent kernel info leaks.
* Extensive security hardening and updated packages.

Sincere appreciation is expressed to Tails for the torbirdy replacement!</ref>

=== VirtualBox ===

* VirtualBox <code>6.1.12</code> upgrade: <ref>In earlier release updates, VirtualBox was upgraded to version <code>6.1.2</code>; see [https://forums.whonix.org/t/please-update-whonix-vbox-guest-addition-modules/8798/3 Get VirtualBox from Debian sid and recompile for Debian buster]</ref>
** Rebuilt using VirtualBox <code>6.1.12</code>.
** Uploaded VirtualBox <code>6.1.12</code> to Whonix repository (downloaded from [https://www.virtualbox.org/ virtualbox.org] repository).
** Overcame [[Dev/VirtualBox#VirtualBox_Installation_Challenges|technical challenges acquiring VirtualBox <code>6.1.12</code> on Debian buster]].
** Installed [https://packages.debian.org/virtualbox-guest-additions-iso virtualbox-guest-additions-iso] by default in new builds beginning from this version. <ref>Related: [[Dev/VirtualBox#VirtualBox_Guest_Additions_ISO_Freedom_vs_Non-Freedom|VirtualBox Guest Additions ISO Freedom vs Non-Freedom]]</ref>

* Reverted to <code>vmsvga</code> grapics controller settings due to [https://forums.whonix.org/t/black-screen-on-15-0-0-6-6-and-15-0-0-7-1/8554 issues].
* [https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-virtualbox-15-0-0-8-7-testers-wanted-vanguards-tcp-isn-leak-protection-extensive-hardening/8914/4 Increased] Whonix-Gateway default RAM to 1280 MB. Otherwise, VirtualBox guest additions kernel modules fail to compile.
* Current [[VirtualBox/Troubleshooting#VirtualBox_Screen_Resolution_Bug Improve|VirtualBox screen resolution situation]]:
** Functional VirtualBox VM Window → View → Virtual Screen 1 → resize to resolution
** Functional VirtualBox VM Window → View → Adjust Window Size
** A workaround to improve this situation is still required.
** Added <code>xserver-xorg-video-vmware</code> to <code>kicksecure-desktop-environment-essential-gui</code> because it is required by VirtualBox Graphics Controller VMSVGA for auto resize and resize through VirtualBox settings menu.
** Again set the VirtualBox Graphics Controller to VMSVGA (equivalent to “VirtualBox → click a VM → Settings → Display → Graphics Controller → VMSVGA → OK”). <ref>Quote [https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch03.html VirtualBox manual]: <blockquote>VMSVGA: Use this graphics controller to emulate a VMware SVGA graphics device. This is the default graphics controller for Linux guests.</blockquote></ref> <ref>This has better desktop resolution in CLI (virtual terminal) mode. When it was previously disabled, this led to a [https://forums.whonix.org/t/black-screen-on-15-0-0-6-6-and-15-0-0-7-1/8554 black screen] on <code>15.0.0.6.6</code> and <code>15.0.0.7.1</code>.</ref>
** Increased Whonix VirtualBox Whonix-Gateway video RAM to 128 MB since the previous assignment of only 16 MB RAM can cause resize issues.
** Updated VirtualBox and VirtualBox guest addition to <code>6.1.4</code>. The VirtualBox guest addition has been further upgraded to <code>6.1.6</code> in a later Whonix release.
* Added a workaround for the bug causing the VirtualBox screen resolution to be too small; the screen resolution is now [https://forums.whonix.org/t/make-screen-resolution-1920x1080-by-default-for-all-vms/9143 1920x1080 by default for all VMs].
* Configured three (instead of four) virtual CPU cores by default as this can improve stability. <ref>https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/19500</ref>
* Enabled the Debian stable-updates repository by default. <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/enable-debian-stable-updates-repository-by-default/9382</ref>
* Consolidated Whonix packages. <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/consolidating-whonix-packages/1945</ref>
* Installed fewer unneeded packages such as rsyslog (see footnote). <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-default-packages-review-mmdebstrap-varriant-related-risk-of-regressions/9254</ref>
* Unbreak VirtualBox clearnet DNS settings when not using DNSCrypt.
