It is useful to run from the Qubes installation which should backed up as full raw disk backup.

Tested in Qubes R4.0 only. In later Qubes versions with untrusted storage domain, these instructions might need changes.

In dom0, install gparted.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo qubes-dom0-update gparted
}}

In dom0, run gparted.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo --set-home gparted
}}

Make notes. For example.

/dev/sda (476.91 GiB)

Check the button below the <code>X/</code> (which would close the window) if there are multiple disks.

Obviously easiest if there is only 1 disk. Assuming there is only 1 disk.
