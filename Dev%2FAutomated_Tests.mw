----

* Some ideas
* higher -> higher priority
* Very unfixed priorities.

----

Try with stable repository vs stable-proposed-updates repository vs testers repository vs developers repository. As per [[Project-APT-Repository]].

----

* Start Tor Browser
** visit some websites
** visit onion websites
** close Tor Browser
** Did it properly terminate with exit code 0 or some other? Did the process terminate or is it lingering?
** update Tor Browser (if available)
* change password
* run "sudo apt update" and "sudo apt apt dist-upgrades"
* reboot
* everything still OK?
* run "sudo apt autoremove"
* test again, everything still OK?
* install newer kernel from backports as per [[Kernel|instructions]]
* screen resolution, [[VirtualBox/Troubleshooting#Screen_Resolution_Bug|VirtualBox Screen Resolution Bug]]
* run <code>whonixcheck --verbose --leak-tests --gui --cli</code>
** check if there is a whonixcheck CLI output, if there is a GUI window popup, if that is dismissable using OK or close button
* other activities users are doing such as
** start thunar
** browse some files
** open a file in a text editor
*** type something
*** save file
*** re-open file
* edit file with root rights
* other common activities which come to your mind?
** is the screen properly maximized?
* copy/paste text from host to vm and back
* shared folder tests
* USB auto mount test
* boot into recovery mode
* normal boot and switch to [[Desktop#Virtual_Consoles|virtual console]]
** switch back to graphical console
* set up [[Recovery#Serial_Console|serial console]]
* `sudo apt install debug-misc`
* lower VM RAM to 256 MB
** does [[RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter]] avoid starting the desktop environment?
** Can login in [[Desktop#Virtual_Consoles|virtual console]]?
* run <code>sudo /usr/share/hardened-kernel/build</code>, install new kernel, reboot
* enough for now or should I come up with more?

The tests ideally would be aware in which boot mode (normal, recovery, future [https://forums.whonix.org/t/multiple-boot-modes-for-better-security-persistent-user-live-user-persistent-admin-persistent-superadmin-persistent-recovery-mode/7708 others], it would boot and which virtual terminal it would run the test in. Maybe that could be an abstraction.

Some tests are virtualizer specific. A lot tests will function in Qubes-Whonix hopefully (such as Tor Browser tests) but shared folder tests are different for VBox / KVM. Virtualization can be detected using <code>systemd-detect-virt</code>.
