|description=Design Documentation of Whonix's Time Synchronization Mechanism
}}
[[Image:timesync_gui.png|TimeSync (Whonix) done|thumb]]

= Basic Knowledge =
== Introduction ==
The Post Install Advice is part of this design, therefore read [[Post Install Advice#Network Time Syncing|Network Time Syncing]] first. Also read the Advanced Security Guide chapter [[Advanced Security Guide#Network Time Synchronization|Network Time Synchronization]] as well.

== Virtualizers Time Synchronization Features ==
=== VirtualBox Time Synchronization Features ===
{{Anchor|VirtualBox's Time Synchronization Features}}
For understanding Whonix's Time Synchronization Mechanism, it is required to know VirtualBox's time synchronization features:

* VirtualBox uses the host's time if it needs to correct the time for guests.
* (Some of VirtualBox's time synchronization features depend on guest additions.)
* By default VirtualBox corrects Virtual Machine guests' virtual hardware system clock,
** when they get powered on,
** when they resume from suspension and
** when their clock is more than X minutes off.

=== KVM's Time Synchronization Features ===
TODO: document

=== Qubes Time Synchronization Features ===
TODO: document

== Facts ==
People have been using:

* Tor Browser and Mozilla Firefox in parallel
* Tails inside VMs and Firefox on the host
* Tor Browser inside Whonix-Workstation and Mozilla Firefox on the host

== Other Facts ==
* Almost no one and no operating system is using Secure Network Time Synchronization or External Clocks by default. Most systems synchronize the system clock using unauthenticated NTP. An adversary tampering with NTP replies or malicious NTP server makes things even worse. Even if there was authenticated NTP, there is a requirement for a distributed trust model.
* A system not using NTP or using authenticated NTP stands out from most other users.
* clock jumps are bad: [http://www.wired.com/2012/07/leap-second-glitch-explained/ wired: The Inside Story of the Extra Second That Crashed the Web]

== Definitions ==
* Time Sanity Check in context of Whonix: Is an init.d script, which checks if the system clock is between build timestamp and expiration date (17 MAY 2033 10:00:00).

= Attacks =
A correct system clock is crucial for many reasons (see footnotes for more):

* '''Attack 1:''' Replay attacks <ref>Replay old Tor consensus, see [https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/Time_syncing/ Tails: Time syncing] for detailed explanation.</ref>
* '''Attack 2:''' Feeding old/outdated/known vulnerable updates and (https) certificates <ref>Cryptographic verification depends on system clock, i.e. a clock two years in past will accept certificates/updates, which have been expired/revoked for two years.</ref>
* '''Attack 3:''' Deanonymizing <ref>Javascript is enabled in Tor Button by default and it can be used to read the client's clock, see http://ip-check.info for demonstration. Also other applications do leak the client's clock, such as Thunderbird (patch has been proposed by TorBirdy developers) and https. Imagine the user connects to an adversary controlled web-server with Mozilla Firefox and connects to another web-server controlled by the same adversary with Tor Browser. As long as TBB upstream [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3059 Bug #3059: Find some way to deal with time-based fingerprints] is open, the adversary can link the anonymous and non-anonymous session, thus deanonymizing.</ref>
* '''Attack 4:''' Linking all sessions to the same pseudonym <ref>If the clock is too much off, it's also easy for an adversary's web-server to detect "Oh, that's the Tor Browser user who's clock is X in past/future.", thus allowing the adversary to link all sessions to the same pseudonym. See Tor Browser upstream bug #3059: [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3059 Find some way to deal with time-based fingerprints].</ref>
* '''Attack 5:''' Locating hidden services. <ref>
For hidden services a correct clock is crucial, see:
* [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sjm217/papers/ccs06hotornot.pdf Hot or Not: Revealing Hidden Services by their Clock Skew]
* [http://caia.swin.edu.au/talks/CAIA-TALK-080728A.pdf An improved clock-skew measurement technique for revealing hidden services]
* [http://people.cs.umass.edu/~elisha/Papers/SkewMask%20-%20final%20version.pdf SkewMask: Frustrating Clock Skew Fingerprinting Attempts]
</ref>

= Whonix's Time Synchronization Mechanism =
== Overview ==
* Whonix leaves the host's system clock or time synchronization mechanism untouched.
* Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation are based on VirtualBox and therefore have their own virtual hardware system clocks.
* Most VirtualBox time synchronization features get disabled by Whonix.
** Guest additions time synchronization gets disabled in ''/etc/init.d/sdwdate'' at run time. See VirtualBox bug report [https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/10828 VBoxService --disable-timesync broken]. They say it's actually not a bug. It's a missing feature, that running instances of VBoxService can not be modified in their settings. Whonix would need to edit ''/etc/init.d/vboxadd-service'' by adding ''--disable-timesync'' <ref>[https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/2928 source]</ref>. Whonix developer Patrick Schleizer does not see a reliable way to do so. If the guest additions get automatically updated in future the option would get overwritten. That's why Whonix added a line in ''/etc/init.d/sdwdate'' to turn it off completely. Guest additions time synchronization gets disabled, but the rest of the guest additions continue to work fine. Unless you have a better idea, it's an acceptable workaround.
** built in time synchronization features get disabled by ''VBoxManage setextradata "$VMNAME" "VBoxInternal/Devices/VMMDev/0/Config/GetHostTimeDisabled" "1"'' at build time.
* Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation
** When get powered on, they still get their time from the host. The user is advised to modify the biossystemtimeoffset in Advanced Security Guide, chapter [[Advanced Security Guide#Network Time Synchronization|Network Time Synchronization]]. <ref>Developer information: If we needed or wanted to render the hardware clock unusable, we could set VirtualBox ''--biossystemtimeoffset'' several decades in past or future.</ref>
** Time Sanity Check before sdwdate will be executed, this ensures, that the host clock is sane and not slow in 1980. User gets advised to fix its host clock in such cases.
** After they are connected to the Tor network, they use sdwdate (inspired by [https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/Time_syncing/ tails_htp]) to set the system clock. <ref>Stream isolation has been added, for Whonix's sdwdate implementation i.e. people using Tor Browser prevent notifying their exit relay, that they are sdwdate or Whonix users.</ref>
** Time Sanity Check after sdwdate was executed. This should catch eventual bigger bugs and attacks. User gets informed if it fails.
* On Whonix-Workstation,
** Using Boot Clock Randomization, i.e. after boot, the clock is set randomly between 5 and 180 seconds into the past or future. This is useful to enforce the design goal, that the host clock and Whonix-Workstation clock should always slightly differ. It's also useful to obfuscate the clock when sdwdate itself is running, because naturally at this time, sdwdate hasn't finished.
** Every hour, at a random time, sdwdate will set the clock again. This is useful for machines running for long time periods without reboot.
** An adversary could guess if someone is running a hidden service with constant clock adjustments, that it's hosted inside a Whonix-Workstation. It's unknown if the clock adjustments by sdwdate are big enough to enable an adversary to guess that.
*** '''TODO''': Open question... "''ntpd adjusts the clock in small steps so that the timescale is effectively continuous and without discontinuities''" - is that possible with a sdwdate like approach as well? -> Working on [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/169 sclockadj].
* Whonix-Gateway
** Doesn't use Boot Clock Randomization. If the assumption is correct, that the ISP can detect clock jumps by observing Tor's TLS client hello <ref name=tlsleakone />; <ref name=tlsleaktwo />, clock jumps should be avoided to prevent fingerprinting Whonix users.
** Uses sdwdate after booting.
** Using it at all is better against Attack (1) when using a bridge.
** Running sdwdate also every [ 1440 minutes + random(0-1440) ]. Not running this every hour at a random time, because Tor does not like clock jumps. When testing this, there were cases where the clock jumped about 800 seconds, which caused Tor to expire circuits, which caused connection interrupts.
** '''TODO''': Open question... How often should sdwdate run on Whonix-Gateway? Every hour is a bad idea, as we see above. Not running it again when some people may run Whonix-Gateway for days or weeks is not good either, since the clock can drift. Maybe it should run wait 24 hours and then wait a random amount of minutes within 24 hours? -> Will be solved when [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/169 sclockadj] gets finished.
*** The entry guard or bridge can see the time through TCP timestamp. <ref name=tlsleakone>
See [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7277 torproject.org #7277: timestamp leaked in TLS client hello]. The ticket says fixed. However, [https://packages.debian.org/de/wheezy/openssl Debian wheezy (currently: stable) (which Whonix 8 is based on) is using OpenSSL 1.0.1e] but Nick's [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7277#comment:15 patch will appear first in 1.0.1e]. It will be solved when Whonix is based on Debian jessie, because that contains [https://packages.debian.org/de/jessie/openssl a more recent version of OpenSSL].
</ref>; <ref name=tlsleaktwo>
See [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/4852 torproject.org #4852: Clients send NETINFO with time]. The ticket says fixed. However, [https://packages.debian.org/de/wheezy/tor Debian wheezy (currently: stable) (which Whonix 8 is based on) is using Tor 0.2.3] but Nick's [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/4852#comment:20 patch will appear first in 0.2.4]. It will be solved when Whonix is based on Debian jessie, because that contains [https://packages.debian.org/de/jessie/tor a more recent version of Tor].
</ref>
*** Continuous clock jumps could help the entry guard or bridge guessing, that a Whonix-Gateway is connected.
*** '''TODO''': Open question... "''ntpd adjusts the clock in small steps so that the timescale is effectively continuous and without discontinuities''" - is that possible with a sdwdate like approach as well? -> Will be solved when [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/169 sclockadj] gets finished.
* Hardware Clock:
** Whonix-Gateway: set to UTC. OpenSSL (used by Tor) leaks it <ref name=tlsleakone />; <ref name=tlsleaktwo />, but that is of no concern. Tor is running on Linux and Linux is expected to be run in UTC. Therefore there is no point to set it to the local time zone of the user.
** Whonix-Workstation: set to UTC
* sdwdate runs at non-predictable times to prevent the ISP or Tor guard/bridge node to guess, that the user is running Whonix.
* Implementation details are in Design-Shared, chapter [[Dev/Design-Shared#timesync|TimeSync]]
* That will reach the design goal, that all clocks, the host's, Whonix-Gateway's and Whonix-Workstation's slightly differ.

==== How Secure is it? ====
It is designed to be as secure as TLS (RFC 2246) but of course the security of TLS is often reduced to whichever CA racket you believe is trustworthy. By default, sdwdate uses curl that by default trusts your local CA root store - so when any of these companies assist in a MITM attack, malicious time information could be feed into your system.

== sdwdate ==
=== Time Fetching Methods ===
==== Introduction ====
Only "Remote Web Servers Method" is implemented at the moment. "Tor Consensus Method" is only an idea.

==== Remote Web Servers Method ====
===== Authentication of Servers =====
[https://github.com/Whonix/sdwdate sdwdate] only connects to HTTPS servers, and delegates TLS X.509 certificate verification to curl. It also uses several different pools of time sources, and if there are too many that fail for any given pool, e.g. because of failed certificate checking or being unreachable, the pool is considered to be potentially compromised and sdwdate aborts.

curl is also directed to only use TLSv1 as a "secure" protocol.

===== sdwdate source pools =====
Planned changes: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/310

What sources should be trusted? This is of course also a problem with NTP.

The sdwdate pools used by Whonix are based on stable and reliable webservers that get great amounts of traffic. They are categorized into three different pools according to their members' relationship to the members in the other pools; any member in a one pool should be unlikely to share logs (or other identifying data), or to agree to send fake time information, with a member from the other pools. The pools are as follows:

* The "pal" pool are run by groups that are likely to take great care of their visitors' privacy.
* The "foe" pool are managed by adversaries of the "pal" pool.
* The "neutral" pool members have a neutral raltionship to both the "pal" and "foe" pool.

The pools are listed in {{Code2|whonix_shared/etc/sdwdate.d/30_sdwdate_default}}.

Basically, sdwdate picks three random servers - one from each pool, and then builds the [average (Whonix 8 bug)] [mediate (Whonix 9)] of the three advertised dates.

==== Tor Consensus Method ====
===== Introduction =====
'''Just an idea. Not yet implemented.'''

Tails' [https://git-tails.immerda.ch/tails/plain/config/chroot_local-includes/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/20-time.sh {{Code2|tordate}}] ([https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/Time_syncing/#index3h1 Guessing time based on Tor consensus]), renamed to {{Code2|anondate}} for trademark reasons and refactored to work outside of Tails provides useful bash functions to check system clock using Tor's consensus file and Tor's log.

https://github.com/Whonix/anon-shared-helper-scripts/blob/master/usr/lib/anon-shared-helper-scripts/anondate

Tor connects to the network. The Tor consensus file contains rough time information. Since when and until when it is valid.

{{Code2|tordate}} (now {{Code2|anondate}}) can provide us with a few machine readable infos we can then use for whatever we may need them.

This is magic.
<pre>
valid-after=2014-07-31 21:00:00
valid-until=2014-08-01 00:00:00
</pre>

This is simply {{Code2|/bin/date}}.
<pre>
Current time is 2014-07-31 22:44:02
</pre>

Less magic.
<pre>
Current time is in valid Tor range
</pre>

Less magic, but maybe useful.
<pre>
Current time is not in valid Tor range, setting to middle of this range: [2014-07-31 22:30:00]
</pre>

{{Code2|anondate}} can do this by parsing Tor's verified consensus file {{Code2|/var/lib/cached-microdesc-consensus}} or by parsing {{Code2|/var/lib/tor/unverified-microdesc-consensus}}.

===== Open Questions =====
====== Under which conditions Tor is not able to verify the Tor consensus file? ======
1) If it has been tampered with by a man-in-the-middle.

2) For clocks that are more than 30 days in the past or 2 days in the future, Tor will not even be able to download a consensus. In this case anondate can parse Tor's log and report the authority's cert's valid-after date. <ref>
Source, source code comment in tordate: https://git-tails.immerda.ch/tails/plain/config/chroot_local-includes/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/20-time.sh
<pre>
	# Since Tor 0.2.3.x Tor doesn't download a consensus for
	# clocks that are more than 30 days in the past or 2 days in
	# the future.  For such clock skews we set the time to the
	# authority's cert's valid-after date.
</pre>
</ref>

<pre>
anondate --tor-cert-valid-after
</pre>

<pre>
Jun 16 00:00:00 2014 GMT
</pre>

Is the authority's cert's valid-after date signed/verified/built-into-Tor or can it be tampered with by a man-in-the-middle attack?

3) Anything else?

====== Other Questions ======
* When can anondate set time from verified and when only from unverified consensus file.
* How reliable is it to do something as non-standard, unintended, inventive such as parsing Tor's consensus and Tor's log?
* When clock is more than 1 hour in past or more than 3 hour in future, Tor will be unable to establish circuits? <ref>https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-February/023264.html</ref>
* How accurate has the clock to be so hidden services can be accessed? See: https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3460

===== Reasons for solely on anondate for time setting =====
* Does not require [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/24 ssl certificate pinning].
* Does not rely on remote web servers.
* Does not require a somewhat accurate clock as [[#Remote Web Servers Method]] requires to get a rough time guess.

===== Reasons against relying solely on anondate for time setting =====
* Provides only rough time.
** [[Fingerprint#For_the_websites_that_you_are_visiting|web fingerprint]] would differ from most other Tor users.
** Would cause lots of support requests complaining about skewed clocks.
** Might trouble hidden services (such as hidden web servers) that need to show time to clients?
** Might trouble people attempting to [[i2p|tunnel i2p through Tor]]?
** Might cause other (gpg) verification issues?
* Fingerprinting issues at ISP level:
** In situation, where the clock is that much off, that Tor cannot establish circuits, setting time using anondate required, restart of Tor required:
*** As per [[Comparison with Others#Fingerprint]], quoted from the [https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/Time_syncing/#index5h1 Tails Design about Time syncing]: "Our initial time guess based on the Tor consensus is probably easier to fingerprint, though: a fresh Tor is started, and restarted again right after the consensus has been downloaded."
*** Related: [[Comparison with Others#Network Time related]]
* <s>Hidden services can only be accessed if the clock is no more than 30 minutes slow or fast. <ref>https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3582#comment:3</ref></s>
* [https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/5774 Tails ticket: Robust time syncing] Quote: <blockquote>Currently we use tordate to set the initial clock. It's very messy and error prone, so we desperately need a robust replacement.</blockquote>
* Vulnerable to ISP level man-in-the-middle attacks:
** [https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/Time_syncing/ Tails Design: Time Syncing] Quote: <blockquote>First, replaying a consensus older than one week or so results in preventing access to the Tor network, and that's all, because onion keys will be wrong.</blockquote>
*** In a situation where an adversary is replaying a more than ~7 days old consensus:
**** anondate could report a clock that is more than ~7 days slow. With a system clock that is that slow, Tor would no longer be able to establish circuits. But there are multiple reasons why Tor may not be able to establish circuits. So anondate could only guess, that the clock reported in Tor consensus is more than ~7 days slow, but not know with certainty. 
*** In a situation where an adversary is replaying an up to ~7 days old consensus:
**** anondate could report a clock that is up to ~7 days slow and Tor would still be able to create circuits.
**** With Tor as is at the moment, anondate cannot even in principle provide a more accurate time guess than a clock that is up to ~7 days slow.
**** Using an up to ~7 days old consensus, is most likely something we really should avoid?
** In comparison to [[TimeSync#Remote_Web_Servers_Method|Remote Web Servers Method]], an adversary does not even need to break SSL CA's, but can do an even simpler attack by replaying an old Tor consensus.
** Therefore vulnerable to Attack 3 as per [[#Attacks]].

===== Conclusions =====
* Relying solely on anondate for time setting is probably a bad idea.
* Using anondate as a sanity test and for debugging (useful user output) may be useful: [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/244 sdwdate-plugin-anondate]
* Rough time fix.
** Only for users that do not care about being temporarily [[Fingerprint|fingerprinted]]! This needs proper documentation.
** If clock is too much off so sdwdate cannot fix it, use anondate to get a rough time fix, then let sdwdate do the rest.

===== Why not use tordate by Tails instead of reinventing the wheel with anondate? =====
* Because Tails code is highly Tails specific.
** Depending on non-persistent Tor data dir.
** Entangled with Tails specific gui notifications.
** Entangled into the Tails specific boot process with other scripts.
** Not a clean abstraction of "tell me what Tor's log / Tor's consensus thinks about date/time".
** Quote: "Currently we use tordate to set the initial clock. It's very messy and error prone, so we desperately need a robust replacement." <ref>https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/5774</ref>
* Patrick wouldn't want opening up to the fingerprinting risks without the user being aware of it.
* Patrick wouldn't know how to just re-use it on Whonix without cleaning it up.
* After all, Patrick is very happy about all their grep / date / sed magic, and re-using that code without modification. anondate is just cleaning up API / abstraction layer / boot process.

===== Random Stuff =====
* [https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2012-January/000822.html tails-dev mailing list: tordate: why is it safe to set time from unverified-consensus?]
** Patrick would argue, that string parsing a unverified consensus using anondate is more risky [hitting hypothetical vulnerabilities in grep] than string parsing a verified Tor consensus.
* Tor consensus is in some cases downloaded from Tor directory authorities and in some cases from Tor directory mirrors. The latter should not be trusted as much as the former.
* We ought to not download the Tor consensus exclusively from Tor directory authorities. Source: <ref>https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,514.msg4001.html#msg4001</ref> <blockquote><armadev> oh. i think that would be horrible. hundreds of thousands of users doing that could overwhelm the directory authorities.</blockquote>

===== Status of this idea =====
* Needs more research.
* Let's implement [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/244 sdwdate-plugin-anondate] first.
* A simple command line tool that can parse Tor's consensus and Tor's log as been implemented: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/244#issuecomment-54340723
* Perhaps relying solely on anondate for time setting could be implemented as an alternative [[Dev/TimeSync#Time_Fetching_Methods|Time Fetching Method]] into sdwdate and be available as an option (disabled by default in Whonix).


=== Trusted Time Sources ===

* (9) Whonix after startup -> sdwdate in daemon mode -> when user runs "sudo service sdwdate restart" or apt-get upgrades sdwdate ->
** Whonix 9: same as (1)
** Whonix 10: same as (5) (6) (7) (8) as per https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/264


* (10) Whonix after startup -> user runs timesync -> timesync works like a monitor -> timesync restarts sdwdate -> sdwdate in startup mode -> timesync shows progress bar and monitors sdwdate -> show active popup (with result, either: crash / failed / succeeded)

= Conclusions =
* <span style="background-color: {{Red}}">'''Attack 1'''</span> is a general Tor problem. It is impossible to solve for Whonix. It is unsolved in other projects as well.
* <span style="background-color: {{Yellow}}">'''Attack 2'''</span> gets partially defeated.
** Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation are immune.
** This problem is unsolved in other projects as well.
*** This is a general problem with all operating systems.
*** The host is still at risk.

* <span style="background-color: {{Green}}">'''Attack 3'''</span> gets defeated, Whonix adds additional security.
* <span style="background-color: {{Green}}">'''Attack 4'''</span> gets defeated, Whonix adds additional security.
* <span style="background-color: {{Red}}">'''Attack 5'''</span> is a general Tor problem, which can not be solved by Whonix and which is unsolved in other projects as well. Since host, Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation time all differ, at least this attack becomes harder against Whonix.

When the user powers on Whonix-Gateway and the host time is too much off, it will not be able to connect to the Tor network. It is advised, when powering on Whonix-Gateway, to check that the host time is no more than 1 hour in past or more than 3 hour in future, otherwise Tor will be unable to establish circuits.<ref>https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-February/023264.html</ref>

An adversary tampering with the user's clock, while the user doesn't recognize that, can't do any more damage to Whonix than he could do to the Tor Browser Bundle. Worst case is a denial of service for Tor. On the other hand, an adversary capable of actively tampering with the traffic between the user and its entry guard or bridge poses much bigger risks to Tor in general. <ref>General Tor problems, Tor is known to be broken against many active attacks. This can not be solved by Whonix. When an adversary is capable of running active attacks, tampering with the time leading into a denial of service is the least of the worries. The adversary could also disrupt the service easier. And as for active attacking in general, there are other attacks which are easier to deploy and which pose a greater danger. Not a Whonix specific problem.</ref> 

The reason for running TimeSync on Whonix-Gateway, is that hidden services can only be accessed if the clock is no more than 30 minutes slow or fast.<ref>https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3582#comment:3</ref> Running TimeSync ensures, that Whonix-Gateway's clock is reasonably accurate.

= External Clock =
This topic is still under research. Help is welcome.

It might make sense to add an external clock, such as a GPS, or even better an atomic clock. (Can we get an atomic USB clock?) This clock should be added to the host and/or Whonix-Gateway and/or Whonix-Workstation?

Open question: would the GPS/atomic clock be too accurate and would that make Whonix more fingerprintable?

== tlsdate ==
https://github.com/ioerror/tlsdate

Pros:
* uses seccomp
* written by Jacob (top-grade security researcher)

Cons:
* only native SSL CA pinning support, no direct SSL certificate pinning support
* does not distribute trust as sdwdate does (https://github.com/ioerror/tlsdate/issues/112) (https://github.com/ioerror/tlsdate/issues/143#issuecomment-57053323)
* does not support hooks for user notifications about state of network time synchronization -> users shouldn't use the internet in Whonix-Workstation before network time synchronization finished, and timesync is informing users about this -> implementing notifications would be difficult or require patching tlsdate
* does not gradually adjust as sdwdate does with [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/169 Slow Clock Adjuster] ([https://github.com/Whonix/sdwdate/blob/master/usr/lib/sclockadj sclockadj])
* <s>[https://github.com/ioerror/tlsdate/issues/146 recent TLS patches might break tlsdate in future] (Or not... tlsdate can already alternatively extract time from http headers using --http switch.</s>
* Cannot connect to (most) Tor hidden services. [That do not additionally allow TLS connections, which most do not, because [[Hidden_Services#Notes_about_End-to-end_security_of_Hidden_Services connections to Tor hidden services are end-to-end* encrypted by default]].] (https://github.com/ioerror/tlsdate/issues/157)

== htpdate ==
* [http://www.vervest.org/htp/ htpdate] ([https://packages.debian.org/jessie/htpdate debian package])
* unresponsive upstream [tails-dev contact them because of their tails_htp fork - no reply] [no reply to Patrick in past]
* no code in revision control (git etc.)
* only eventually in [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/341#issuecomment-57505853 theoretic considerations] safer than curl

== htp ==

= TODO =
== Consideration no TimeSync on Host ==
Would it be advisable to run no network time synching daemon on the host at all? There are open questions. See: https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,512.msg3945.html#msg3945

== Time Source of Time Servers ==
Even if we could very securely obtain the time from a server with distributed trust and everything, the question is, how do these servers themselves set their own clock? If they just use unauthenticated NTP themselves, they might not be a big help.
